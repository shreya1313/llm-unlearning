{"45": "Chapter 1\nA LONG-EXPECTED PARTY\nWhen Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly\nbe celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special mag-\nnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\nBilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder\nof the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance\nand unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his\ntravels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed,\nwhatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of\ntunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame,\nthere was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it\nseemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the\nsame as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but\nunchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that\nshook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it\nseemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual\nyouth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.\n\u2018It will have to be paid for,\u2019 they said. \u2018It isn\u2019t natural, and trouble\nwill come of it!\u2019\nBut so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous\nwith his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities\nand his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives\n(except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many de-\nvoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.\nBut he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began\nto grow up.\nThe eldest of these, and Bilbo\u2019s favourite, was young Frodo\nBaggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir,\nand brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-\nBagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have\nthe same birthday, September 22nd. \u2018You had better come and live\nhere, Frodo my lad,\u2019 said Bilbo one day; \u2018and then we can celebrate\nour birthday-parties comfortably together.\u2019 At that time Frodo was\nstill in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties\nbetween childhood and coming of age at thirty-three."}
{"46": "understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for\nthat autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious\nnumber, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself\nhad only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33,an\nimportant number: the date of his \u2018coming of age\u2019.\nTongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of\nthe coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and charac-\nter of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conver-\nsation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in\nwelcome demand.\nNo one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee,\ncommonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a\nsmall inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority,\nfor he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had\nhelped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was\nhimself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried\non by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on\nvery friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill\nitself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.\n\u2018A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I\u2019ve always\nsaid,\u2019 the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very\npolite to him, calling him \u2018Master Hamfast\u2019, and consulting him\nconstantly upon the growing of vegetables \u2013 in the matter of \u2018roots\u2019,\nespecially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority\nby all in the neighbourhood (including himself ).\n\u2018But what about this Frodo that lives with him?\u2019 asked Old Noakes\nof Bywater. \u2018Baggins is his name, but he\u2019s more than half a Brandy-\nbuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go\nlooking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.\u2019\n\u2018And no wonder they\u2019re queer,\u2019 put in Daddy Twofoot (the\nGaffer\u2019s next-door neighbour), \u2018if they live on the wrong side of the\nBrandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That\u2019s a dark bad\nplace, if half the tales be true.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re right, Dad!\u2019 said the Gaffer. \u2018Not that the Brandybucks\nof Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they\u2019re a queer breed, seem-\ningly. They fool about with boats on that big river \u2013 and that isn\u2019t\nnatural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as\nit may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to\nmeet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all\nhis father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo\nBaggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.\u2019\n\u2018Drownded?\u2019 said several voices. They had heard this and other"}
{"47": "\u2018Well, so they say,\u2019 said the Gaffer. \u2018You see: Mr. Drogo, he\nmarried poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo\u2019s\nfirst cousin on the mother\u2019s side (her mother being the youngest of\nthe Old Took\u2019s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin.\nSo Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either\nway, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying\nat Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he\noften did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old\nGorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating\non the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and\npoor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,\u2019\nsaid Old Noakes; \u2018and it was Drogo\u2019s weight as sunk the boat.\u2019\n\u2018And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,\u2019\nsaid Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\n\u2018You shouldn\u2019t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,\u2019 said the Gaffer,\nwho did not much like the miller. \u2018There isn\u2019t no call to go talking\nof pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that\nsit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway:\nthere was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might\nsay, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in\nBrandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc\nnever had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr.\nBilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to\nlive among decent folk.\n\u2018But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses.\nThey thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he\nwent off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and\norders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking\na day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has\nall the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won\u2019t never\nsee the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,\u2019\nsaid a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the\nWestfarthing. \u2018All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with\nchests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I\u2019ve heard.\u2019\n\u2018Then you\u2019ve heard more than I can speak to,\u2019 answered the\nGaffer. \u2018I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money,\nand there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw\nMr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I\nwas a lad. I\u2019d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my\ndad\u2019s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep"}
{"48": "a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don\u2019t\ndoubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign\nparts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn\u2019t\nenough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that.\nHe\u2019s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days, he\nis, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo\u2019s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him\nhis letters \u2013 meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will\ncome of it.\n\u2018Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better\nfor me and you. Don\u2019t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters,\nor you\u2019ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might say\nit to others,\u2019 he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.\nBut the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of\nBilbo\u2019s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger\ngeneration of hobbits.\n\u2018Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at\nfirst,\u2019 argued the miller, voicing common opinion. \u2018He\u2019s often away\nfrom home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves\ncoming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all.\nYou can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End\u2019s a queer place, and\nits folk are queerer.\u2019\n\u2018And you can say what you like, about what you know no more\nof than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,\u2019 retorted the Gaffer, dislik-\ning the miller even more than usual. \u2018If that\u2019s being queer, then we\ncould do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There\u2019s some not\nfar away that wouldn\u2019t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived\nin a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End.\nOur Sam says that everyone\u2019s going to be invited to the party, and\nthere\u2019s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all \u2013 this very\nmonth as is.\u2019\nThat very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A\nday or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable\nSam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks \u2013 fire-\nworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh\non a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.\nDays passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon\nladen with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening\nand toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out\nof lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing\nstrange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of\nthem remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in Sep-"}
{"49": "He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf.\nHe had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond\nthe brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through\nHobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they\nrightly guessed. At Bilbo\u2019s front door the old man began to unload:\nthere were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each\nlabelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .\nThat was Gandalf \u2019s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf\nthe Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with\nfires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and\ndangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he\nwas just one of the \u2018attractions\u2019 at the Party. Hence the excitement\nof the hobbit-children. \u2018G for Grand!\u2019 they shouted, and the old man\nsmiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbi-\nton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any\nbut the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays \u2013\nthey now belonged to a legendary past.\nWhen the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had\nfinished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single\nsquib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the\nonlookers.\n\u2018Run away now!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You will get plenty when the time\ncomes.\u2019 Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was\nshut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and\nthen made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.\nInside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window\nof a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon\nwas bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-\ndragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls\nand peeping in at the round windows.\n\u2018How bright your garden looks!\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear\nold Shire; but I think I need a holiday.\u2019\n\u2018You mean to go on with your plan then?\u2019\n\u2018I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven\u2019t changed it.\u2019\n\u2018Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan \u2013\nyour whole plan, mind \u2013 and I hope it will turn out for the best, for\nyou, and for all of us.\u2019\n\u2018I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have\nmy little joke.\u2019\n\u2018Who will laugh, I wonder?\u2019 said Gandalf, shaking his head."}
{"50": "The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts.\nThere might have been some grumbling about \u2018dealing locally\u2019, but\nthat very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind\nof provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbi-\nton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became\nenthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and\nthey watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.\nBefore long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton\npost-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed\nunder, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a\nconstant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of\npolite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.\nA notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittance\nexcept on party business. Even those who had, or pretended to\nhave Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy:\nwriting invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and\nmaking some private preparations of his own. From the time of\nGandalf \u2019s arrival he remained hidden from view.\nOne morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of\nBilbo\u2019s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pav-\nilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road,\nand wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three\nhobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely\ninterested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even\npretending to work in his garden.\nThe tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so\nbig that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood\nproudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were\nhung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits\u2019 mind):\nan enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the\nfield. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles\naround, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that\nwere quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.\nThen the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve\nof the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the\n22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags\nwere unfurled and the fun began.\nBilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of enter-\ntainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was\ninvited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned\nup all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts\noftheShirewerealsoasked;andtherewereevenafewfromoutside"}
{"51": "were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by\nthe gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays.\nNot very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this\noccasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and\nBywater every day in the year was somebody\u2019s birthday, so that every\nhobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least\nonce a week. But they never got tired of them.\nOn this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-\nchildren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about\neating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before,\nall beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed\nbeen ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the\nMountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.\nWhen every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the\ngate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food\nand drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner\n(or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that\nat those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together.\nAt other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking\n\u2013continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks\nstarted.\nThe fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by\nhim, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set\npieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was also\na generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers,\ntorches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-\nclaps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.\nThere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with\nsweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their\nleaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their\nshining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished\nhobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their\nupturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering\ninto the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned\ninto eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was\na red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest\nof silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an\nembattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss\nlike a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in\nhonour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf\nintended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped\nitself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the"}
{"52": "his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times\nover the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on\ntheir faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somer-\nsault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.\n\u2018That is the signal for supper!\u2019 said Bilbo. The pain and alarm\nvanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There\nwas a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those\ninvited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great\npavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen\n(a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word\nwas not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were\nselected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related,\nwith the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ).\nMany young hobbits were included, and present by parental per-\nmission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter\nof sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them\na free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.\nThere were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and\nBrandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins\u2019\ngrandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grand-\nfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brock-\nhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these\nwere only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly\never been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the\nShire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife\nLobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but\nso magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that\nthey had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo,\nhad been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high\nreputation.\nAll the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant\nfeast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their\nhost (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he\ncalled poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to\nthe absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were\nnot disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing\nentertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase\nof provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the\nensuing weeks; but as Bilbo\u2019s catering had depleted the stocks of\nmost of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did\nnot matter much.\nAfter the feast (more or less) came the Speech.

They were prepared to listen to anything, and\nto cheer at every full stop.\nMy dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. \u2018Hear! Hear! Hear!\u2019\nthey shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant\nto follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood\non a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell\non his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered\nsilk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in\nthe air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.\nMy dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks\nand Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Horn-\nblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.\n\u2018Proudfeet!\u2019 shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion.\nHis name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were\nlarge, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.\nProudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I\nwelcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh\nbirthday: I am eleventy-one today! \u2018Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy\nReturns!\u2019 they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables.\nBilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked:\nshort and obvious.\nI hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening\ncheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes\nand flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been\nsaid, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had\nbeen pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did\nnot convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they\nwere marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of\nperfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of\nthe young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have\nfinished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got\nup an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master\nEverard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with\nbells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance,\nbut rather vigorous.\nBut Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby,\nhe blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall not keep you\nlong, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I have called you all\ntogether for a Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made\nan impression. There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks\npricked up their ears."}
{"54": "among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of\napproval.\nI don\u2019t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less\nthan half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and\nrather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them\nwere trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.\nSecondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR\nbirthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew,\nFrodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory\nclapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of \u2018Frodo! Frodo! Jolly\nold Frodo,\u2019 from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and\nwondered what was meant by \u2018coming into his inheritance\u2019.\nTogether we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were\nchosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression.\nNo cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especially\nthe Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had only\nbeen asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package.\n\u2018One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.\u2019\nIt is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary\nof my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact\nthat it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only\nfifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was\nvery splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember,\nand could only say \u2018thag you very buch\u2019. I now repeat it more correctly:\nThank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence.\nThey all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and\nthey were getting bored. Why couldn\u2019t he stop talking and let them\ndrink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a\nmoment.\nThirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT.\nHe spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up\nwho still could. I regret to announce that \u2013 though, as I said, eleventy-one\nyears is far too short a time to spend among you \u2013 this is the END. I am\ngoing. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!\nHe stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of\nlight, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo\nwas nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted\nhobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet\nfrom the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until\nsuddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took,\nBrandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brock-"}
{"55": "food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance.\n\u2018He\u2019s mad. I always said so,\u2019 was probably the most popular comment.\nEven the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo\u2019s behaviour\nwas absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that\nhis disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.\nBut old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an\nenormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-\nlaw, Esmeralda: \u2018There\u2019s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe\nthat mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He\nhasn\u2019t taken the vittles with him.\u2019 He called loudly to Frodo to send\nthe wine round again.\nFrodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some\ntime he had sat silent beside Bilbo\u2019s empty chair, and ignored all\nremarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even\nthough he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from\nlaughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same\ntime he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the\nold hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking\nand discussing Bilbo Baggins\u2019 oddities, past and present; but the\nSackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not\nwant to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more\nwine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently\nto the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.\nAs for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he\nhad been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that\nhe had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped\nit on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton\nagain.\nHe walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listen-\ning with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds of\nmerrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took\noff his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his\nembroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly\nsome old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn\nleather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather\nscabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out\nan old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very\nprecious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their\noriginal colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark\ngreen. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his\nstudy, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in"}
{"56": "bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he\nslipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and\naddressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but\nsuddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment\nthe door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.\n\u2018Hullo!\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018I wondered if you would turn up.\u2019\n\u2018I am glad to find you visible,\u2019 replied the wizard, sitting down in a\nchair, \u2018I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you\nfeel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I do,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018Though that flash was surprising: it quite\nstartled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I\nsuppose?\u2019\n\u2018It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and\nit seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that\nwould seem to explain your sudden vanishment.\u2019\n\u2018And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,\u2019\nlaughed Bilbo, \u2018but I expect you know best, as usual.\u2019\n\u2018I do \u2013 when I know anything. But I don\u2019t feel too sure about this\nwhole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your\njoke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the\nwhole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine\nmore likely. Are you going any further?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have\ntold you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don\u2019t expect I shall\nreturn. In fact, I don\u2019t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.\n\u2018I am old, Gandalf. I don\u2019t look it, but I am beginning to feel it\nin my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!\u2019 he snorted. \u2018Why, I feel\nall thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that\nhas been scraped over too much bread. That can\u2019t be right. I need\na change, or something.\u2019\nGandalf looked curiously and closely at him. \u2018No, it does not\nseem right,\u2019 he said thoughtfully. \u2018No, after all I believe your plan is\nprobably the best.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I\u2019ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains\nagain, Gandalf \u2013 mountains; and then find somewhere where I can\nrest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and\na string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find\nsomewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice\nending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.\u2019\nGandalf laughed. \u2018I hope he will. But nobody will read the book,\nhowever it ends.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as"}
{"57": "\u2018He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he\noffered to once, just before the party. But he does not really want\nto, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the\nMountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods and\nfields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving\neverything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he will\nbe happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It\u2019s time he was\nhis own master now.\u2019\n\u2018Everything?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The ring as well? You agreed to that,\nyou remember.\u2019\n\u2018Well, er, yes, I suppose so,\u2019 stammered Bilbo.\n\u2018Where is it?\u2019\n\u2018In an envelope, if you must know,\u2019 said Bilbo impatiently. \u2018There\non the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!\u2019 He hesitated.\n\u2018Isn\u2019t that odd now?\u2019 he said softly to himself. \u2018Yet after all, why not?\nWhy shouldn\u2019t it stay there?\u2019\nGandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam\nin his eyes.\u2018I think, Bilbo,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018I should leave it behind.\nDon\u2019t you want to?\u2019\n\u2018Well yes \u2013 and no. Now it comes to it, I don\u2019t like parting with\nit at all, I may say. And I don\u2019t really see why I should. Why do you\nwant me to?\u2019 he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It\nwas sharp with suspicion and annoyance. \u2018You are always badgering\nme about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other\nthings that I got on my journey.\u2019\n\u2018No, but I had to badger you,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I wanted the truth.\nIt was important. Magic rings are \u2013 well, magical; and they are rare\nand curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may\nsay; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go\nwandering again. Also I think you have had it quite long enough.\nYou won\u2019t need it any more, Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.\u2019\nBilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly\nface grew hard. \u2018Why not?\u2019 he cried. \u2018And what business is it of yours,\nanyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I\nfound it. It came to me.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But there is no need to get angry.\u2019\n\u2018If I am it is your fault,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018It is mine, I tell you. My own.\nMy Precious. Yes, my Precious.\u2019\nThe wizard\u2019s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker\nin his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. \u2018It\nhas been called that before,\u2019 he said, \u2018but not by you.\u2019\n\u2018But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same"}
{"58": "Bilbo,\u2019 he said. \u2018You make that clearer with every word you say. It\nhas got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go\nyourself, and be free.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll do as I choose and go as I please,\u2019 said Bilbo obstinately.\n\u2018Now, now, my dear hobbit!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018All your long life we\nhave been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you\npromised: give it up!\u2019\n\u2018Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!\u2019 cried Bilbo. \u2018But you\nwon\u2019t get it. I won\u2019t give my Precious away, I tell you.\u2019 His hand\nstrayed to the hilt of his small sword.\nGandalf \u2019s eyes flashed. \u2018It will be my turn to get angry soon,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the\nGrey uncloaked.\u2019 He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed\nto grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.\nBilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching\nat his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air\nof the room tingled. Gandalf \u2019s eyes remained bent on the hobbit.\nSlowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what has come over you, Gandalf,\u2019 he said. \u2018You\nhave never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn\u2019t\nit? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn\u2019t kept it.\nI\u2019m not a thief, whatever he said.\u2019\n\u2018I have never called you one,\u2019 Gandalf answered. \u2018And I am not one\neither. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would\ntrust me, as you used.\u2019 He turned away, and the shadow passed. He\nseemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.\nBilbo drew his hand over his eyes. \u2018I am sorry,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I felt\nso queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with\nit any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I\nhave felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting\nto put it on and disappear, don\u2019t you know; or wondering if it is safe,\nand pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I\ncouldn\u2019t rest without it in my pocket. I don\u2019t know why. And I don\u2019t\nseem able to make up my mind.\u2019\n\u2018Then trust mine,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It is quite made up. Go away\nand leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will\nlook after him.\u2019\nBilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he\nsighed. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said with an effort. \u2018I will.\u2019 Then he shrugged\nhis shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. \u2018After all that\u2019s what this\nparty business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthday-\npresents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same"}
{"59": "\u2018Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,\u2019\nsaid Gandalf.\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 said Bilbo, \u2018it goes to Frodo with all the rest.\u2019 He drew\na deep breath. \u2018And now I really must be starting, or somebody else\nwill catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn\u2019t bear to do it all\nover again.\u2019 He picked up his bag and moved to the door.\n\u2018You have still got the ring in your pocket,\u2019 said the wizard.\n\u2018Well, so I have!\u2019 cried Bilbo. \u2018And my will and all the other\ndocuments too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. That\nwill be safest.\u2019\n\u2018No, don\u2019t give the ring to me,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Put it on the mantel-\npiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for him.\u2019\nBilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by\nthe clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor.\nBefore he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set\nit in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit\u2019s face\nagain. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s that,\u2019 he said. \u2018Now I\u2019m off !\u2019\nThey went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from\nthe stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different\nrooms where they had been busy.\n\u2018Is everything ready?\u2019 asked Bilbo. \u2018Everything packed and labelled?\u2019\n\u2018Everything,\u2019 they answered.\n\u2018Well, let\u2019s start then!\u2019 He stepped out of the front-door.\nIt was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He\nlooked up, sniffing the air. \u2018What fun! What fun to be off again, off\non the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing\nfor, for years! Good-bye!\u2019 he said, looking at his old home and bowing\nto the door. \u2018Good-bye, Gandalf !\u2019\n\u2018Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself ! You are\nold enough, and perhaps wise enough.\u2019\n\u2018Take care! I don\u2019t care. Don\u2019t you worry about me! I am as happy\nnow as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time\nhas come. I am being swept off my feet at last,\u2019 he added, and then\nin a low voice, as if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:\nThe Road goes ever on and on\nDown from the door where it began.\nNow far ahead the Road has gone,\nAnd I must follow, if I can,\nPursuing it with eager feet,\nUntil it joins some larger way"}
{"60": "He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he\nturned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents, and\nfollowed by his three companions went round into his garden, and\ntrotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in\nthe hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the\nnight like a rustle of wind in the grass.\nGandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness.\n\u2018Good-bye, my dear Bilbo \u2013 until our next meeting!\u2019 he said softly\nand went back indoors.\nFrodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark,\ndeep in thought. \u2018Has he gone?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 answered Gandalf, \u2018he has gone at last.\u2019\n\u2018I wish \u2013 I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a\njoke,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But I knew in my heart that he really meant to\ngo. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come\nback sooner, just to see him off.\u2019\n\u2018I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,\u2019 said\nGandalf. \u2018Don\u2019t be too troubled. He\u2019ll be all right \u2013 now. He left a\npacket for you. There it is!\u2019\nFrodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it,\nbut did not open it.\n\u2018You\u2019ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,\u2019\nsaid the wizard. \u2018You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I\nfancy, you\u2019ll find a golden ring.\u2019\n\u2018The ring!\u2019 exclaimed Frodo. \u2018Has he left me that? I wonder why.\nStill, it may be useful.\u2019\n\u2018It may, and it may not,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I should not make use of\nit, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going\nto bed.\u2019\nAs master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye\nto the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over\nthe field, but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared\nup in the morning. About midnight carriages came for the important\nfolk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied\nhobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-\nbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.\nNight slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later.\nMorning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away\nthe pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives\nand bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in"}
{"61": "Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses,\nand Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived or\nwere staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-fed were out and\nabout again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not\nunexpected.\nFrodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired\nand worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more\nto say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: \u2018Mr.\nBilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.\u2019 Some of\nthe visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left \u2018messages\u2019\nfor them.\nInside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages\nand parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was\na label tied. There were several labels of this sort:\nFor ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; on an\numbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.\nFor DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with\nlove from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo\u2019s\nsister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she\nwas ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than\nhalf a century.\nFor MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.; on a\ngold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.\nFor ANGELICA\u2019S use, from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex mirror.\nShe was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face\nshapely.\nFor the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor;on\nan (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and\nworse than usual at returning them.\nFor LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT; on a\ncase of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good\nmany of his spoons, while he was away on his former journey. Lobelia\nknew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the\npoint at once, but she also took the spoons.\nThis is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo\u2019s\nresidence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his\nlong life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for\nwhich the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely\nresponsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always\nnew; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had\ncirculated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new"}
{"62": "Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out per-\nsonally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of\ncourse, most of the things were given where they would be wanted\nand welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot\nRow, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes,\na new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creak-\ning joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality,\ngot a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the\nSouthfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by\nBilbo\u2019s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capital\nfellow after the first bottle.\nThere was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all\nthe chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than\nenough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however,\nno sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a\nglass bead was given away.\nFrodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that\nthe whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire;\nand before long the place was packed with people who had no\nbusiness there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and\nmixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and\ndeals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor items\nnot addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or\nunwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and\nhandcarts.\nIn the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived.\nFrodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck\nto keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo,\nMerry bowed politely.\n\u2018He is indisposed,\u2019 he said. \u2018He is resting.\u2019\n\u2018Hiding, you mean,\u2019 said Lobelia. \u2018Anyway we want to see him\nand we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!\u2019\nMerry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to\ndiscover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers.\nEventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a\ntable with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed \u2013 to\nsee Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with\nsomething in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.\nThe Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by\noffering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valu-\nable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things"}
{"63": "\u2018Only one thing is clear to me,\u2019 said Otho, \u2018and that is that you\nare doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.\u2019\nOtho would have been Bilbo\u2019s heir, but for the adoption of\nFrodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately,\nvery clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits,\nwhich demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in\nred ink).\n\u2018Foiled again!\u2019 he said to his wife. \u2018And after waiting sixty years.\nSpoons? Fiddlesticks!\u2019 He snapped his fingers under Frodo\u2019s nose\nand stumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little\nlater Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on,\nand found her still about the place, investigating nooks and corners,\nand tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after\nhe had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that\nhad somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she\nwas in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark;\nbut all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:\n\u2018You\u2019ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn\u2019t you go too? You\ndon\u2019t belong here; you\u2019re no Baggins \u2013 you \u2013 you\u2019re a Brandybuck!\u2019\n\u2018Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,\u2019 said\nFrodo as he shut the door on her.\n\u2018It was a compliment,\u2019 said Merry Brandybuck, \u2018and so, of course,\nnot true.\u2019\nThen they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits\n(two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of\none of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho\nProudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot\u2019s grandson), who had begun an exca-\nvation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The\nlegend of Bilbo\u2019s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary\ngold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every-\none knows, anyone\u2019s for the finding \u2013 unless the search is interrupted.\nWhen he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo col-\nlapsed on a chair in the hall. \u2018It\u2019s time to close the shop, Merry,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018Lock the door, and don\u2019t open it to anyone today, not even if\nthey bring a battering ram.\u2019 Then he went to revive himself with a\nbelated cup of tea.\nHe had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the\nfront-door. \u2018Lobelia again most likely,\u2019 he thought. \u2018She must have\nthought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say\nit. It can wait.\u2019\nHe went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder,"}
{"64": "\u2018If you don\u2019t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down\nyour hole and out through the hill,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018My dear Gandalf ! Half a minute!\u2019 cried Frodo, running out of\nthe room to the door. \u2018Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.\u2019\n\u2018Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-\ntrap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.\u2019\n\u2018She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on\nBilbo\u2019s ring. I longed to disappear.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t do that!\u2019 said Gandalf, sitting down. \u2018Do be careful of that\nring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a\nlast word.\u2019\n\u2018Well, what about it?\u2019\n\u2018What do you know already?\u2019\n\u2018Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found\nit, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.\u2019\n\u2018Which story, I wonder,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018He told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said\nyou had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. \u2018\u2018No\nsecrets between us, Frodo,\u2019\u2019 he said; \u2018\u2018but they are not to go any\nfurther. It\u2019s mine anyway.\u2019\u2019 \u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s interesting,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Well, what did you think of it\nall?\u2019\n\u2018If you mean, inventing all that about a \u2018\u2018present\u2019\u2019, well, I thought\nthe true story much more likely, and I couldn\u2019t see the point of\naltering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I\nthought it rather odd.\u2019\n\u2018So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such\ntreasures \u2013 if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very\ncareful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanish\nwhen you wish to.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Neither do I,\u2019 answered the wizard. \u2018I have merely begun to\nwonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry.\nBut if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all.\nAt least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or\nrouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!\u2019\n\u2018You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of ?\u2019\n\u2018I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you\nsomething when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is\ngood-bye for the present.\u2019 He got up.\n\u2018At once!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018Why, I thought you were staying on for"}
{"65": "away for a good while; but I\u2019ll come and see you again, as soon as I\ncan. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan\u2019t often\nbe visiting the Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather\nunpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace.\nSome people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or\nworse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between\nyou and me to get hold of his wealth.\u2019\n\u2018Some people!\u2019 exclaimed Frodo. \u2018You mean Otho and Lobelia.\nHow abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else,\nif I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with\nhim. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone\ntoo. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.\u2019\n\u2018So do I,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018And I wonder many other things. Good-\nbye now! Take care of yourself ! Look out for me, especially at unlikely\ntimes! Good-bye!\u2019\nFrodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and\nwalked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard\nlooked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight.\nThe evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished\ninto the twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time."}
{"66": "Chapter 2\nTHE SHADOW OF THE PAST\nThe talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The\nsecond disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbi-\nton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was\nremembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for\nyoung hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with\na bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became\na favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true\nevents were forgotten.\nBut in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood\nwas that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone\nquite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly\nfallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an\nuntimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.\n\u2018If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps\nhe\u2019ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,\u2019 they said. And to all\nappearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down,\nbut the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he\nat once began to carry on Bilbo\u2019s reputation for oddity. He refused\nto go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of\nBilbo\u2019s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called a Hundred-\nweight Feast. But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests were\ninvited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and\nrained drink, as hobbits say.\nSome people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom\nof giving Bilbo\u2019s Birthday Party year after year until they got used to\nit. He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked:\n\u2018Where is he then?\u2019 he shrugged his shoulders.\nHe lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many\nfriends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descen-\ndants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and\noften in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger\nwere two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took\n(usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was\nMeriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping\nover the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself,"}
{"67": "and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had\ndone.\nAs time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed\nsigns of good \u2018preservation\u2019: outwardly he retained the appearance\nof a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. \u2018Some folk\nhave all the luck,\u2019 they said; but it was not until Frodo approached\nthe usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.\nFrodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own\nmaster and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For\nsome years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the\nfuture. But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone\nwith Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering at\ntimes, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strange\nvisions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams.\nHe began to say to himself: \u2018Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one\nday.\u2019 To which the other half of his mind always replied: \u2018Not yet.\u2019\nSo it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth\nbirthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was some-\nhow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that\nadventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless,\nand the old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and\nwondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire\nshowed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took to wandering\nfurther afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other\nfriends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking\nwith the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the\nShire.\nThere were rumours of strange things happening in the world\noutside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any\nmessage for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could.\nElves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing\nwestward through the woods in the evening, passing and not\nreturning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer\nconcerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the\nroad in unusual numbers. The ancient East\u2013West Road ran through\nthe Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always\nused it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains. They were\nthe hobbits\u2019 chief source of news from distant parts \u2013 if they wanted\nany: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more. But now\nFrodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in"}
{"68": "That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like\na shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous\nand disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been\ndriven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength\nin the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt,\nit was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and\naway far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were\nmultiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer\ndull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And\nthere were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these,\nbut they had no name.\nLittle of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits.\nBut even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer\ntales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange\nthings. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening\nin the spring of Frodo\u2019s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfort-\nable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits\nstill laughed at them.\nSam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite\nhim was Ted Sandyman, the miller\u2019s son; and there were various\nother rustic hobbits listening to their talk.\n\u2018Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Ted, \u2018you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales\nand children\u2019s stories at home, if I want to.\u2019\n\u2018No doubt you can,\u2019 retorted Sam, \u2018and I daresay there\u2019s more\ntruth in some of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories\nanyway? Take dragons now.\u2019\n\u2018No thank \u2019ee,\u2019 said Ted, \u2018I won\u2019t. I heard tell of them when I was a\nyoungster, but there\u2019s no call to believe in them now. There\u2019s only one\nDragon in Bywater, and that\u2019s Green,\u2019 he said, getting a general laugh.\n\u2018All right,\u2019 said Sam, laughing with the rest. \u2018But what about these\nTree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that\none bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors\nnot long back.\u2019\n\u2018Who\u2019s they?\u2019\n\u2018My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and\ngoes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.\u2019\n\u2018Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal\u2019s always saying he\u2019s seen things;\nand maybe he sees things that ain\u2019t there.\u2019\n\u2018But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking \u2013 walking\nseven yards to a stride, if it was an inch.\u2019"}
{"69": "\u2018But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain\u2019t no elm tree\non the North Moors.\u2019\n\u2018Then Hal can\u2019t have seen one,\u2019 said Ted. There was some laugh-\ning and clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored\na point.\n\u2018All the same,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018you can\u2019t deny that others besides our\nHalfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire \u2013 crossing it, mind\nyou: there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders\nhave never been so busy before.\n\u2018And I\u2019ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they\nare going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.\u2019 Sam\nwaved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it\nwas to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders of\nthe Shire. But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the\nGrey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return.\n\u2018They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into\nthe West and leaving us,\u2019 said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking\nhis head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.\n\u2018Well, that isn\u2019t anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I\ndon\u2019t see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant\nyou haven\u2019t seen them doing it; nor anyone else in the Shire.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had\nonce seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day.\nOf all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments\nof tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits\nknew, had always moved him most deeply. \u2018There are some, even in\nthese parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news of them,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018There\u2019s Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they\nwere sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew\nmore: many\u2019s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, they\u2019re both cracked,\u2019 said Ted. \u2018Leastways old Bilbo was\ncracked, and Frodo\u2019s cracking. If that\u2019s where you get your news\nfrom, you\u2019ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I\u2019m off home.\nYour good health!\u2019 He drained his mug and went out noisily.\nSam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think\nabout. For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden,\nand he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The\ngrass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his mind than garden-\ning. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.\nIt was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain.\nThe sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into\nnight. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and"}
{"70": "It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long\nabsence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he\npaid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went\noff again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often,\ncoming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning\nbefore sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys,\nand seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo\u2019s health\nand doings.\nThen suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since\nFrodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the\nwizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits.\nBut that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading,\nthere came the once familiar tap on the study window.\nFrodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight.\nThey looked hard at one another.\n\u2018All well eh?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You look the same as ever, Frodo!\u2019\n\u2018So do you,\u2019 Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf\nlooked older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself\nand of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they\nstayed up far into the night.\nNext morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with\nFrodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire was on the\nhearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Every-\nthing looked fresh, and the new green of spring was shimmering in\nthe fields and on the tips of the trees\u2019 fingers.\nGandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when\nBilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was\nperhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows\nwere perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom;\nbut his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-\nrings with the same vigour and delight.\nHe was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep\nin thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of\nthe tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.\n\u2018Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring,\nGandalf,\u2019 he said. \u2018And then you stopped, because you said that such\nmatters were best left until daylight. Don\u2019t you think you had better\nfinish now? You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than\nI guess. In what way?\u2019\n\u2018In many ways,\u2019 answered the wizard. \u2018It is far more powerful than\nI ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would"}
{"71": "\u2018In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as\nyou call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more\npotent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft\nbefore it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles\n\u2013 yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings,\nthe Rings of Power, they were perilous.\n\u2018A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not\ndie, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues,\nuntil at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the\nRing to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end\ninvisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the\nDark Power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later \u2013 later, if he is\nstrong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good\npurpose will last \u2013 sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him.\u2019\n\u2018How terrifying!\u2019 said Frodo. There was another long silence. The\nsound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.\n\u2018How long have you known this?\u2019 asked Frodo at length. \u2018And\nhow much did Bilbo know?\u2019\n\u2018Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he\nthought would be a danger, even though I promised to look after\nyou. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful at need;\nand if anything was wrong or queer, it was himself. He said that it\nwas \u2018\u2018growing on his mind\u2019\u2019, and he was always worrying about it;\nbut he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he\nhad found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seem\nalways of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd\nway, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018so I\nhave always kept it on its chain.\u2019\n\u2018Very wise,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But as for his long life, Bilbo never con-\nnected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to himself,\nand he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and uneasy.\nThin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting control.\u2019\n\u2018How long have you known all this?\u2019 asked Frodo again.\n\u2018Known?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I have known much that only the Wise\nknow, Frodo. But if you mean \u2018\u2018known about this ring\u2019\u2019, well, I still\ndo not know, one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no\nlonger doubt my guess.\n\u2018When did I first begin to guess?\u2019 he mused, searching back in\nmemory. \u2018Let me see \u2013 it was in the year that the White Council"}
{"72": "though I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often how\nGollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was \u2013 that at least was\nclear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo\u2019s strange story of how he had\n\u2018\u2018won\u2019\u2019 it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the truth out\nof him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the\nring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his \u2018\u2018birthday-present\u2019\u2019.\nThe lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had\nan unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once. That\nwas the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo\noften that such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, and\nsoon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not take\nit from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so\nanyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consulted\nSaruman the White, but something always held me back.\u2019\n\u2018Who is he?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018I have never heard of him before.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe not,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018Hobbits are, or were, no concern\nof his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order\nand the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride\nhas grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the\nElven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it,\nseeking the lost secrets of their making; but when the Rings were\ndebated in the Council, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-lore\ntold against my fears. So my doubt slept \u2013 but uneasily. Still I watched\nand I waited.\n\u2018And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they\npassed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of\nage. The shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: \u2018\u2018After all he\ncomes of a long-lived family on his mother\u2019s side. There is time yet.\nWait!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said\nand did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of\nSaruman could allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly\nwas at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in finding\nout the truth of it.\u2019\n\u2018There wasn\u2019t any permanent harm done, was there?\u2019 asked Frodo\nanxiously. \u2018He would get all right in time, wouldn\u2019t he? Be able to\nrest in peace, I mean?\u2019\n\u2018He felt better at once,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But there is only one Power\nin this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as\nfar as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all about\nhobbits.

Otherwise, he might\nlive on for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted\nwith it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important\npoint. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he\nhad let the thing go. It is for you that I feel responsible.\n\u2018Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you,\nand about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be\na grievous blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire;\nif all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Brace-\ngirdles, and the rest, not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became\nenslaved.\u2019\nFrodo shuddered. \u2018But why should we be?\u2019 he asked. \u2018And why\nshould he want such slaves?\u2019\n\u2018To tell you the truth,\u2019 replied Gandalf, \u2018I believe that hitherto \u2013\nhitherto, mark you \u2013 he has entirely overlooked the existence of\nhobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does\nnot need you \u2013 he has many more useful servants \u2013 but he won\u2019t\nforget you again.

I still don\u2019t understand\nwhat all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.\u2019\n\u2018It has everything to do with it,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You do not know\nthe real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I\nwas last here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for\na moment.\u2019\nFrodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a\nchain that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowly\nto the wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo\nhimself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it.\nGandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold.\n\u2018Can you see any markings on it?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018There are none. It is quite plain, and it never\nshows a scratch or sign of wear.\u2019\n\u2018Well then, look!\u2019 To Frodo\u2019s astonishment and distress the wizard\nthrew it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire.\nFrodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him\nback."}

For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he\nstooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs, and at\nonce picked it up. Frodo gasped.\n\u2018It is quite cool,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Take it!\u2019 Frodo received it on his\nshrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than\never.\n\u2018Hold it up!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018And look closely!\u2019\nAs Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest pen-\nstrokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that\nseemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly\nbright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth.\n\u2018I cannot read the fiery letters,\u2019 said Frodo in a quavering voice.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient\nmode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.\nBut this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,\nOne Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\nIt is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:\nThree Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,\nSeven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die,\nOne for the Dark Lord on his dark throne\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,\nOne Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\u2019"}
{"75": "that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He\ngreatly desires it \u2013 but he must not get it.\u2019\nFrodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast\nhand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf\nhim. \u2018This ring!\u2019 he stammered. \u2018How, how on earth did it come to\nme?\u2019\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018That is a very long story. The beginnings lie\nback in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember.\nIf I were to tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when\nSpring had passed into Winter.\n\u2018But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord.\nThe rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again\nand left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness\nin the Dark Tower of Mordor. That name even you hobbits have\nheard of, like a shadow on the borders of old stories. Always after a\ndefeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows\nagain.\u2019\n\u2018I wish it need not have happened in my time,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018So do I,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and so do all who live to see such times.\nBut that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to\ndo with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time is\nbeginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong.\nHis plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shall\nbe hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if it were\nnot for this dreadful chance.\n\u2018The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and know-\nledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover\nall the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.\n\u2018The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his\nhand never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings\npossessed, but three he has recovered, and the others the dragons\nhave consumed. Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and\nso ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One,\nand they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his\nmost terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine\nwalked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more,\nthey too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things\neven in the morning of the Shire.\n\u2018So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also,\nor else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that no\nlonger troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring"}
{"76": "will command them all again, wherever they be, even the Three, and\nall that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will be\nstronger than ever.\n\u2018And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One\nhad perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been\ndone. But he knows now that it has not perished, that it has been\nfound. So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on\nit. It is his great hope and our great fear.\u2019\n\u2018Why, why wasn\u2019t it destroyed?\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018And how did the\nEnemy ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious\nto him?\u2019 He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark\nfingers stretching out to seize it.\n\u2018It was taken from him,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The strength of the Elves\nto resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estranged\nfrom them. The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a\nchapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall; for there\nwas sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valour, and great\ndeeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I will tell you all\nthe tale, or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best.\n\u2018But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how\nthis thing came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that\nI will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse\nwho overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished in the deed;\nand Isildur Elendil\u2019s son cut the Ring from Sauron\u2019s hand and took\nit for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and\nwas hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again in\nMirkwood.\n\u2018But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and\nvanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the\nRiver, and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of\nthe Mountains, and almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the\nwaters, but the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, and then\nthe Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows.\u2019\nGandalf paused. \u2018And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden\nFields,\u2019 he said, \u2018the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and\neven so much of its history is known now only to a few, and the\nCouncil of the Wise could discover no more. But at last I can carry\non the story, I think.\n\u2018Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the\nGreat River on the edge of Wilderland a clever-handed and quiet-\nfooted little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the"}
{"77": "family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, and\nit was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore,\nsuch as they had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that\nfamily was called Sme\u00b4agol. He was interested in roots and beginnings;\nhe dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing\nplants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at\nthe hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air:\nhis head and his eyes were downward.\n\u2018He had a friend called De\u00b4agol, of similar sort, sharper-eyed but\nnot so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down\nto the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flower-\ning reeds. There Sme\u00b4agol got out and went nosing about the banks\nbut De\u00b4agol sat in the boat and fished. Suddenly a great fish took his\nhook, and before he knew where he was, he was dragged out and\ndown into the water, to the bottom. Then he let go of his line, for\nhe thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; and holding\nhis breath he grabbed at it.\n\u2018Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful\nof mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the\nmud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone\nand glittered in the sun, so that his heart was glad. But Sme\u00b4agol had\nbeen watching him from behind a tree, and as De\u00b4agol gloated over\nthe ring, Sme\u00b4agol came softly up behind.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Give us that, De\u00b4agol, my love,\u2019\u2019 said Sme\u00b4agol, over his friend\u2019s\nshoulder.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Why?\u2019\u2019 said De\u00b4agol.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Because it\u2019s my birthday, my love, and I wants it,\u2019\u2019 said Sme\u00b4agol.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019\u2019 said De\u00b4agol. \u2018\u2018I have given you a present already,\nmore than I could afford. I found this, and I\u2019m going to keep it.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Oh, are you indeed, my love,\u2019\u2019 said Sme\u00b4agol; and he caught\nDe\u00b4agol by the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked so\nbright and beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.\n\u2018No one ever found out what had become of De\u00b4agol; he was\nmurdered far from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But\nSme\u00b4agol returned alone; and he found that none of his family could\nsee him, when he was wearing the ring. He was very pleased with\nhis discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secrets,\nand he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. He became\nsharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had\ngiven him power according to his stature. It is not to be wondered\nat that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible)\nby all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took"}
{"78": "to go far away; and his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him\nfrom the family and turned him out of her hole.\n\u2018He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of\nthe world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream\nthat flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way. He\ncaught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw.\nOne day it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he felt\na burning on the back of his head, and a dazzling light from the water\npained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgotten\nabout the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and shook his\nfist at her.\n\u2018But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far ahead the tops of the Misty\nMountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly:\n\u2018\u2018It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could\nnot watch me there. The roots of those mountains must be roots\nindeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been\ndiscovered since the beginning.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a\nlittle cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way\nlike a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all\nknowledge. The Ring went into the shadows with him, and even the\nmaker, when his power had begun to grow again, could learn nothing\nof it.\u2019\n\u2018Gollum!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very\nGollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!\u2019\n\u2018I think it is a sad story,\u2019 said the wizard, \u2018and it might have\nhappened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however\ndistantly,\u2019 said Frodo with some heat. \u2018What an abominable notion!\u2019\n\u2018It is true all the same,\u2019 replied Gandalf. \u2018About their origins, at\nany rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo\u2019s\nstory suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background\nof their minds and memories that was very similar. They understood\none another remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would\nunderstand, say, a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even an Elf. Think of the\nriddles they both knew, for one thing.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles,\nand of much the same sort. And hobbits don\u2019t cheat. Gollum meant\nto cheat all the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his\nguard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which\nmight end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost would"}
{"79": "else in it, I think, which you don\u2019t see yet. Even Gollum was not\nwholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise\nwould have guessed \u2013 as a hobbit might. There was a little corner of\nhis mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as through\na chink in the dark: light out of the past. It was actually pleasant, I\nthink, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind,\nand trees, and sun on the grass, and such forgotten things.\n\u2018But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier\nin the end \u2013 unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.\u2019\nGandalf sighed. \u2018Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no\nhope. No, not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far\nback as he can remember. For it was long since he had worn it much:\nin the black darkness it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never\n\u2018\u2018faded\u2019\u2019. He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up his\nmind, of course, and the torment had become almost unbearable.\n\u2018All the \u2018\u2018great secrets\u2019\u2019 under the mountains had turned out to\nbe just empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing\nworth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering.\nHe was altogether wretched. He hated the dark, and he hated light\nmore: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Surely the Ring was his Precious\nand the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn\u2019t he get\nrid of it, or go away and leave it?\u2019\n\u2018You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have\nheard,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved\nhimself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.\n\u2018A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off treacher-\nously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the\nidea of handing it on to someone else\u2019s care \u2013 and that only at an\nearly stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo\nalone in history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He\nneeded all my help, too. And even so he would never have just\nforsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring\nitself that decided things. The Ring left him.\u2019\n\u2018What, just in time to meet Bilbo?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t an Orc\nhave suited it better?\u2019\n\u2018It is no laughing matter,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Not for you. It was the\nstrangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo\u2019s arrival\njust at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.\n\u2018There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was\ntrying to get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur\u2019s hand\nand betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor De\u00b4agol,"}
{"80": "mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his\ndeep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and\nsending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum.\nOnly to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo\nfrom the Shire!\n\u2018Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design\nof the Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo\nwas meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you\nalso were meant to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought.\u2019\n\u2018It is not,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Though I am not sure that I understand\nyou. But how have you learned all this about the Ring, and about\nGollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?\u2019\nGandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. \u2018I knew much and\nI have learned much,\u2019 he answered. \u2018But I am not going to give an\naccount of all my doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur\nand the One Ring is known to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to\nbe that One Ring by the fire-writing alone, apart from any other\nevidence.\u2019\n\u2018And when did you discover that?\u2019 asked Frodo, interrupting.\n\u2018Just now in this room, of course,\u2019 answered the wizard sharply.\n\u2018But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark journeys\nand long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and all is\nnow only too clear. Making out Gollum\u2019s part, and fitting it into the\ngap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with\nguesses about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have\nseen him.\u2019\n\u2018You have seen Gollum?\u2019 exclaimed Frodo in amazement.\n\u2018Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long\nago; but I have managed it at last.\u2019\n\u2018Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know\nthat?\u2019\n\u2018Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing\nto tell \u2013 though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum\nis a liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the\nRing his \u2018\u2018birthday-present\u2019\u2019, and he stuck to that. He said it came\nfrom his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind.\nA ridiculous story. I have no doubt that Sme\u00b4agol\u2019s grandmother was\na matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing\nmany Elven-rings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a\nlie. But a lie with a grain of truth.\n\u2018The murder of De\u00b4agol haunted Gollum, and he had made up a\ndefence, repeating it to his \u2018\u2018Precious\u2019\u2019 over and over again, as he"}
{"81": "turned up just so as to be a present. It was his birthday-present, and\nso on, and on.\n\u2018I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately\nimportant, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on\nhim, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with\nmuch snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and\nill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as the\nend of the Riddle-game and Bilbo\u2019s escape, he would not say any\nmore, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than\nmine. He muttered that he was going to get his own back. People\nwould see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and\nthen robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very\nstrong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was\nhis chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more,\nhe knew where he came from.\u2019\n\u2018But how did he find that out?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself;\nand after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once\nGollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring\nproved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. After\na year or two he left the mountains. You see, though still bound by\ndesire of it, the Ring was no longer devouring him; he began to revive\na little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally\nhungry.\n\u2018Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he\nalways will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide\nfrom daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly\nby dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened\nor unwary things. He grew stronger and bolder with new food and\nnew air. He found his way into Mirkwood, as one would expect.\u2019\n\u2018Is that where you found him?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018I saw him there,\u2019 answered Gandalf, \u2018but before that he had wan-\ndered far, following Bilbo\u2019s trail. It was difficult to learn anything\nfrom him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses\nand threats. \u2018\u2018What had it got in its pocketses?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It wouldn\u2019t\nsay, no precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it\ndid. It broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious.\nAnd we will, precious!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018That is a sample of his talk. I don\u2019t suppose you want any more.\nI had weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls\nI gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth,\nand even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well,"}
{"82": "had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West.\nGollum\u2019s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.\u2019\n\u2018Then why didn\u2019t he track Bilbo further?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018Why didn\u2019t\nhe come to the Shire?\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to.\nHe set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But\nthen he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure.\nNo, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that\nhunted him for me.\n\u2018The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his\ntrail was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it led\nthem, though they never caught him. The wood was full of the\nrumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds. The\nWoodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that\ndrank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into holes to find\nthe young; it slipped through windows to find cradles.\n\u2018But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It\nwandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves\u2019 ken,\nand was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not\nthe first; though I fear it may prove the worst. I let the matter be. I\nlet him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and I still\ntrusted the lore of Saruman.\n\u2018Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark\nand dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again,\nafter Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in vain, but\nfor the help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller\nand huntsman of this age of the world. Together we sought for\nGollum down the whole length of Wilderland, without hope, and\nwithout success. But at last, when I had given up the chase and\nturned to other paths, Gollum was found. My friend returned out of\ngreat perils bringing the miserable creature with him.\n\u2018What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and\ncalled us cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed\nhim he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his\nfingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture.\nBut I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow,\nsneaking way, step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to the\nLand of Mordor.\u2019\nA heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating.\nEven outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam\u2019s shears could\nnow be heard."}
{"83": "there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him\nopen to the summons. And all folk were whispering then of the new\nShadow in the South, and its hatred of the West. There were his fine\nnew friends, who would help him in his revenge!\n\u2018Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for\nhis comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders\nhe would be caught, and taken \u2013 for examination. That was the way\nof it, I fear. When he was found he had already been there long, and\nwas on his way back. On some errand of mischief. But that does not\nmatter much now. His worst mischief was done.\n\u2018Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has\nbeen found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where\nGollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave\nlong life. He knows that it is not one of the Three, for they have\nnever been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not one\nof the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows that\nit is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of hobbits and the\nShire.\n\u2018The Shire \u2013 he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already\nfound out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think\nthat the long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.\u2019\n\u2018But this is terrible!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018Far worse than the worst that\nI imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends,\nwhat am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What\na pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!\u2019\n\u2018Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to\nstrike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure\nthat he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,\nbecause he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.\u2019\n\u2018I am sorry,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But I am frightened; and I do not feel\nany pity for Gollum.\u2019\n\u2018You have not seen him,\u2019 Gandalf broke in.\n\u2018No, and I don\u2019t want to,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I can\u2019t understand you.\nDo you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on\nafter all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc,\nand just an enemy. He deserves death.\u2019\n\u2018Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And\nsome that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be\ntoo eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise\ncannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured\nbefore he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with\nthe fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play"}
{"84": "not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have\nhim in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find\nin their wise hearts.\u2019\n\u2018All the same,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I\nwish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, and\nthat I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn\u2019t you\nmake me throw it away, or, or destroy it?\u2019\n\u2018Let you? Make you?\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018Haven\u2019t you been listening\nto all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying.\nBut as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings\nhave a way of being found. In evil hands it might have done great\nevil. Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy.\nIndeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is exerting all\nhis power to find it or draw it to himself.\n\u2018Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has\ntroubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to\ntake some risk \u2013 though even when I was far away there has never\nbeen a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes.\nAs long as you never used it, I did not think that the Ring would\nhave any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for a very\nlong time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last\nsaw you, I still knew little for certain.\u2019\n\u2018But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long\nago?\u2019 cried Frodo again. \u2018If you had warned me, or even sent me a\nmessage, I would have done away with it.\u2019\n\u2018Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?\u2019\n\u2018No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.\u2019\n\u2018Try!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Try now!\u2019\nFrodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It\nnow appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he\ncould see. The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought\nhow rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness.\nIt was an admirable thing and altogether precious. When he took it\nout he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of\nthe fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a\ngreat struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and\nforcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then\nwith an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away \u2013\nbut he found that he had put it back in his pocket.\nGandalf laughed grimly. \u2018You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot\neasily let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not \u2018\u2018make\u2019\u2019 you"}
{"85": "heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it. It cannot be\nunmade by your hands, or by mine.\n\u2018Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This\nRing has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But\nthere is no smith\u2019s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not\neven the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has\nbeen said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of\nPower, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the\nold fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even\nAncalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the\nRuling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.\n\u2018There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths\nof Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you\nreally wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for\never.\u2019\n\u2018I do really wish to destroy it!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018Or, well, to have it\ndestroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen\nthe Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?\u2019\n\u2018Such questions cannot be answered,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You may be\nsure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for\npower or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you\nmust therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.\u2019\n\u2018But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and\npowerful. Will you not take the Ring?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. \u2018With that power I should\nhave power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain\na power still greater and more deadly.\u2019 His eyes flashed and his face\nwas lit as by a fire within. \u2018Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to\nbecome like the Dark Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my\nheart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do\ngood. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe,\nunused. The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength. I\nshall have such need of it. Great perils lie before me.\u2019\nHe went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shut-\nters. Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed along\nthe path outside whistling. \u2018And now,\u2019 said the wizard, turning back\nto Frodo, \u2018the decision lies with you. But I will always help you.\u2019 He\nlaid his hand on Frodo\u2019s shoulder. \u2018I will help you bear this burden,\nas long as it is yours to bear. But we must do something, soon.

Have\nyou decided what to do?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness,\nand finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the\nwindow he could see the sunlit garden. \u2018Or perhaps, yes. As far as I\nunderstand what you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and\nguard it, at least for the present, whatever it may do to me.\u2019\n\u2018Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it\nwith that purpose,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018I hope so,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But I hope that you may find some other\nbetter keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger,\na danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay\nhere. I ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and\ngo away.\u2019 He sighed.\n\u2018I should like to save the Shire, if I could \u2013 though there have been\ntimes when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words,\nand have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be\ngood for them. But I don\u2019t feel like that now. I feel that as long as\nthe Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering\nmore bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold,\neven if my feet cannot stand there again.\n\u2018Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imag-\nined that as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo\u2019s or\nbetter, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from\ndanger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go\nalone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small,\nand very uprooted, and well \u2013 desperate. The Enemy is so strong\nand terrible.\u2019\nHe did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to\nfollow Bilbo flamed up in his heart \u2013 to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps\nto find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could\nalmost have run out there and then down the road without his hat,\nas Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago.\n\u2018My dear Frodo!\u2019 exclaimed Gandalf. \u2018Hobbits really are amazing\ncreatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to\nknow about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years\nthey can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such\nan answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing\nhis heir, though he little thought how important it would prove. I"}
{"87": "you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you. That\nname will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild. I will\ngive you a travelling name now.

Not if you know of anyone\nyou can trust, and who would be willing to go by your side \u2013 and\nthat you would be willing to take into unknown perils. But if you\nlook for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful of what\nyou say, even to your closest friends! The enemy has many spies and\nmany ways of hearing.\u2019\nSuddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all\nwas very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the\nwindow. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long\narm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam\nGamgee\u2019s curly head hauled by one ear.\n\u2018Well, well, bless my beard!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Sam Gamgee is it?\nNow what may you be doing?\u2019\n\u2018Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Nothing! Leastways\nI was just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow\nme.\u2019 He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.\n\u2018I don\u2019t,\u2019 said Gandalf grimly. \u2018It is some time since I last heard\nthe sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?\u2019\n\u2018Eavesdropping, sir? I don\u2019t follow you, begging your pardon.\nThere ain\u2019t no eaves at Bag End, and that\u2019s a fact.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?\u2019\nGandalf \u2019s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.\n\u2018Mr. Frodo, sir!\u2019 cried Sam quaking. \u2018Don\u2019t let him hurt me, sir!\nDon\u2019t let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would\ntake on so. I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!\u2019\n\u2018He won\u2019t hurt you,\u2019 said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing,\nalthough he was himself startled and rather puzzled. \u2018He knows, as\nwell as I do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer\nhis questions straight away!\u2019\n\u2018Well, sir,\u2019 said Sam dithering a little. \u2018I heard a deal that I didn\u2019t\nrightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir,\nand dragons, and a fiery mountain, and \u2013 and Elves, sir. I listened\nbecause I couldn\u2019t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless\nme, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I believe them too,\nwhatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them.\nCouldn\u2019t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?\u2019\nSuddenly Gandalf laughed. \u2018Come inside!\u2019 he shouted, and putting\nout both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings\nand all, right through the window and stood him on the floor. \u2018Take"}

He had suddenly\nrealized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings\nthan merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. \u2018I\nshall have to go. But\u2019 \u2013 and here he looked hard at Sam \u2013 \u2018if you\nreally care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See?

Something to shut your\nmouth, and punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with\nMr. Frodo!\u2019\n\u2018Me, sir!\u2019 cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk.\n\u2018Me go and see Elves and all!

{"89": "Chapter 3\nTHREE IS COMPANY\n\u2018You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,\u2019 said Gandalf.\nTwo or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign of\ngetting ready to go.\n\u2018I know. But it is difficult to do both,\u2019 he objected. \u2018If I just vanish\nlike Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.\u2019\n\u2018Of course you mustn\u2019t vanish!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018That wouldn\u2019t do\nat all! I said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slipping\nout of the Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth\na little delay. But you must not delay too long.\u2019\n\u2018What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018I think I could probably make some arrangements by then.\u2019\nTo tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had\ncome to the point: Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than\nit had for years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his\nlast summer in the Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at\nleast of his heart would think more kindly of journeying, as it always\ndid at that season. He had indeed privately made up his mind to\nleave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo\u2019s one hundred and twenty-eighth.\nIt seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow\nhim. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one thing\nthat made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little as\npossible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But\nhe did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed\nwas always difficult to tell.\nHe looked at Frodo and smiled. \u2018Very well,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think that\nwill do \u2013 but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In\nthe meanwhile, do take care, and don\u2019t let out any hint of where you\nare going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I\nreally shall turn him into a toad.\u2019\n\u2018As for where I am going,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018it would be difficult to give\nthat away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t be absurd!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I am not warning you against\nleaving an address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire \u2013\nand that should not be known, until you are far away. And you must\ngo, or at least set out, either North, South, West or East \u2013 and the\ndirection should certainly not be known.\u2019"}
{"90": "said Frodo. \u2018For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What\nis to be my quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again;\nbut I go to lose one, and not return, as far as I can see.\u2019\n\u2018But you cannot see very far,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Neither can I. It may\nbe your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for\nothers: I do not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long\nroad yet.\u2019\n\u2018No indeed!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But in the meantime what course am I\nto take?\u2019\n\u2018Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,\u2019 answered\nthe wizard. \u2018If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey\nshould not prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it\nwas, and it will grow worse as the year fails.\u2019\n\u2018Rivendell!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Very good: I will go east, and I will make\nfor Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.\u2019\nHe spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to\nsee the house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep\nvalley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.\nOne summer\u2019s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the\nIvy Bush and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders\nof the Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo\nwas selling Bag End, indeed he had already sold it \u2013 to the Sackville-\nBagginses!\n\u2018For a nice bit, too,\u2019 said some. \u2018At a bargain price,\u2019 said others,\n\u2018and that\u2019s more likely when Mistress Lobelia\u2019s the buyer.\u2019 (Otho\nhad died some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.)\nJust why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more\ndebatable than the price. A few held the theory \u2013 supported by the\nnods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself \u2013 that Frodo\u2019s money was\nrunning out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way\non the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck\nrelations. \u2018As far from the Sackville-Bagginses as may be,\u2019 some\nadded. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth\nof the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to\nbelieve, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy\ncould suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot\nby Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about\nby day, it was well known that he was \u2018hiding up in the Bag End\u2019.\nBut however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry,\nthere was no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to\nBuckland."}
{"91": "As a matter of fact with Merry\u2019s help he had already chosen\nand bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond\nBucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down\nthere permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had suggested\nthe idea to him; for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire,\nand as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least\nseem credible.\nGandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one\nevening, at the end of June, soon after Frodo\u2019s plan had been finally\narranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again next\nmorning. \u2018Only for a short while, I hope,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I am going\ndown beyond the southern borders to get some news, if I can. I have\nbeen idle longer than I should.\u2019\nHe spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather\nworried. \u2018Has anything happened?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious\nand needs looking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get\noff at once, I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In\nthe meanwhile stick to your plan; but be more careful than ever,\nespecially of the Ring. Let me impress on you once more: don\u2019t use\nit! \u2019\nHe went off at dawn. \u2018I may be back any day,\u2019 he said. \u2018At the\nvery latest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after all\nyou may need my company on the Road.\u2019\nAt first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often\nwhat Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in\nthe fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had\nseldom seen so fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were\nladen with apples, honey was dripping in the combs, and the corn\nwas tall and full.\nAutumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about\nGandalf again. September was passing and there was still no news\nof him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did\nnot come, or send word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo\u2019s\nfriends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was\nFredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special friends\nPippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned the\nwhole place upside-down.\nOn September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland,\nconveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his\nnew home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge.The next day Frodo"}

In the\nevening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner\nfor himself and his four helpers; but he was troubled and felt in no\nmood for it. The thought that he would so soon have to part with\nhis young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he would\nbreak it to them.\nThe four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the\nparty soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf \u2019s absence. The\ndining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was\ngood, and there was good wine: Frodo\u2019s wine had not been included\nin the sale to the Sackville-Bagginses.\n\u2018Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get\ntheir claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!\u2019 said\nFrodo, as he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.\nWhen they had sung many songs, and talked of many things\nthey had done together, they toasted Bilbo\u2019s birthday, and they\ndrank his health and Frodo\u2019s together according to Frodo\u2019s custom.\nThen they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, and\nthen they went to bed. Frodo\u2019s party was over, and Gandalf had not\ncome.\nThe next morning they were busy packing another cart with the\nremainder of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off\nwith Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger). \u2018Someone must get there and\nwarm the house before you arrive,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Well, see you later\n\u2013 the day after tomorrow, if you don\u2019t go to sleep on the way!\u2019\nFolco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo\nwas restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf.\nHe decided to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him\nurgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first.\nFor Frodo was going on foot. His plan \u2013 for pleasure and a last look\nat the Shire as much as any other reason \u2013 was to walk from Hobbiton\nto Bucklebury Ferry, taking it fairly easy.\n\u2018I shall get myself a bit into training, too,\u2019 he said, looking at\nhimself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done\nany strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked\nrather flabby, he thought.\nAfter lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired\nson, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo\u2019s annoyance. \u2018Ours at last!\u2019\nsaid Lobelia, as she stepped inside.

She snorted, and showed\nplainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole\nduring the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.\nHe took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen.\nIt had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland\n\u2018to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden\u2019; an arrangement\nthat was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not console him for\nthe prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour.\n\u2018Our last meal at Bag End!\u2019 said Frodo, pushing back his chair.\nThey left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up\ntheir three packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for\na last stroll in the garden. Sam disappeared.\nThe sun went down.

I feel\nlike walking. I can\u2019t bear any more hanging about. I am going to\nstart, and Gandalf must follow me.\u2019 He turned to go back, and then\nstopped, for he heard voices, just round the corner by the end of\nBagshot Row. One voice was certainly the old Gaffer\u2019s; the other was\nstrange, and somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what it\nsaid, but he heard the Gaffer\u2019s answers, which were rather shrill. The\nold man seemed put out.\n\u2018No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam\nwent with him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, I\ntell\u2019ee. Why? Why\u2019s none of my business, or yours. Where to? That\nain\u2019t no secret. He\u2019s moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away\ndown yonder. Yes it is \u2013 a tidy way. I\u2019ve never been so far myself;\nthey\u2019re queer folks in Buckland. No, I can\u2019t give no message. Good\nnight to you!\u2019\nFootsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why\nthe fact that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief."}

He had been saying farewell to the\nbeer-barrel in the cellar.\n\u2018All aboard, Sam?\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Yes, sir. I\u2019ll last for a bit now, sir.\u2019\nFrodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam.\n\u2018Run down with this to your home, Sam!\u2019 he said. \u2018Then cut along\nthe Row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane\nbeyond the meadows. We are not going through the village tonight.\nToo many ears pricking and eyes prying.\u2019 Sam ran off at full speed.\n\u2018Well, now we\u2019re off at last!\u2019 said Frodo. They shouldered their\npacks and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the\nwest side of Bag End. \u2018Good-bye!\u2019 said Frodo, looking at the dark\nblank windows. He waved his hand, and then turned and (following\nBilbo, if he had known it) hurried after Peregrin down the garden-\npath. They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom\nand took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in the\ngrasses.\nAt the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate\nopening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the\nstraps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and\nbreathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders,\nand he had put on his head a tall shapeless felt bag, which he called\na hat. In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf.\n\u2018I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.\u2019\n\u2018I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,\u2019 said\nSam stoutly and untruthfully.\n\u2018No you don\u2019t, Sam!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018It is good for him. He\u2019s got\nnothing except what he ordered us to pack. He\u2019s been slack lately,\nand he\u2019ll feel the weight less when he\u2019s walked off some of his own.\u2019\n\u2018Be kind to a poor old hobbit!\u2019 laughed Frodo. \u2018I shall be as thin\nas a willow-wand, I\u2019m sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was\ntalking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more than your share,\nSam, and I shall look into it at our next packing.\u2019 He picked up his\nstick again. \u2018Well, we all like walking in the dark,\u2019 he said, \u2018so let\u2019s\nput some miles behind us before bed.\u2019"}

Since they were all hobbits, and were trying\nto be silent, they made no noise that even hobbits would hear. Even\nthe wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing.\nAfter some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a\nnarrow plank-bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding\nblack ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile or two further\nsouth they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge;\nthey were now in the Tookland and bending south-eastwards they\nmade for the Green Hill Country. As they began to climb its first\nslopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twink-\nling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it disappeared in the folds\nof the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater beside its grey\npool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among\nthe trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.\n\u2018I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,\u2019 he said\nquietly.\nWhen they had walked for about three hours they rested. The\nnight was clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were\ncreeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-\nclad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a black\nnet against the pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits),\nand then went on again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that went\nrolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road\nto Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away\nfrom the main road in the Water-valley, and wound over the skirts\nof the Green Hills towards Woody End, a wild corner of the\nEastfarthing.\nAfter a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall\ntrees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At\nfirst they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far\naway from inquisitive ears. Then they marched on in silence, and\nPippin began to lag behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep\nslope, he stopped and yawned.\n\u2018I am so sleepy,\u2019 he said, \u2018that soon I shall fall down on the road.\nAre you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.\u2019\n\u2018I thought you liked walking in the dark,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But there\nis no great hurry.

We\u2019ll halt at the first likely\nspot.\u2019\n\u2018The wind\u2019s in the West,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018If we get to the other side"}

Soon\nthey had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and\nthey sat round it for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in\nan angle of the great tree\u2019s roots, they curled up in their cloaks and\nblankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo\nfeared no danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire. A\nfew creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away.\nA fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped\nseveral minutes and sniffed.\n\u2018Hobbits!\u2019 he thought. \u2018Well, what next? I have heard of strange\ndoings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out\nof doors under a tree. Three of them! There\u2019s something mighty\nqueer behind this.\u2019 He was quite right, but he never found out any\nmore about it.\nThe morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and\nfound that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck\nwas stiff. \u2018Walking for pleasure! Why didn\u2019t I drive?\u2019 he thought, as\nhe usually did at the beginning of an expedition. \u2018And all my beautiful\nfeather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots\nwould do them good.\u2019 He stretched. \u2018Wake up, hobbits!\u2019 he cried.\n\u2018It\u2019s a beautiful morning.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s beautiful about it?\u2019 said Pippin, peering over the edge of\nhis blanket with one eye. \u2018Sam! Get breakfast ready for half-past nine!\nHave you got the bath-water hot?\u2019\nSam jumped up, looking rather bleary. \u2018No, sir, I haven\u2019t, sir!\u2019 he\nsaid.\nFrodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and\nthen walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was\nrising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with\ngold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a\nshadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply\ninto a hollow and disappeared.\nWhen he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going.\n\u2018Water!\u2019 shouted Pippin. \u2018Where\u2019s the water?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t keep water in my pockets,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018We thought you had gone to find some,\u2019 said Pippin, busy setting\nout the food, and cups. \u2018You had better go now.\u2019"}

After some\nmiles, however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to\nthe top of a steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then\nprepared to go down for the last time. In front of them they saw the\nlower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in\nthe distance to a brown woodland haze. They were looking across\nthe Woody End towards the Brandywine River. The road wound\naway before them like a piece of string.\n\u2018The road goes on for ever,\u2019 said Pippin; \u2018but I can\u2019t without a\nrest.

His round eyes were wide open \u2013 for he was\nlooking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon.\n\u2018Do Elves live in those woods?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Not that I ever heard,\u2019 said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was\ngazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before.\nSuddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:\nThe Road goes ever on and on\nDown from the door where it began.\nNow far ahead the Road has gone,\nAnd I must follow, if I can,\nPursuing it with weary feet,\nUntil it joins some larger way,\nWhere many paths and errands meet.\nAnd whither then? I cannot say.\n\u2018That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo\u2019s rhyming,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Or\nis it one of your imitations?

Do you realize that\nthis is the very path that goes through Mirkwood, and that if you let\nit, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to\nworse places?\u2019\u2019 He used to say that on the path outside the front door\nat Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk.\u2019\n\u2018Well, the Road won\u2019t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,\u2019\nsaid Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example,\nputting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road.\nAfter a rest they had a good lunch, and then more rest.\nThe sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was\non the land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a\nsoul on the road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit for\ncarts, and there was little traffic to the Woody End. They had been\njogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment\nas if listening. They were now on level ground, and the road after\nmuch winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with\ntall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.\n\u2018I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,\u2019 said\nSam.\nThey looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from\nseeing far. \u2018I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,\u2019 said Frodo;\nbut even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a\nsudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.\n\u2018It may not matter much,\u2019 he said apologetically, \u2018but I would\nrather not be seen on the road \u2013 by anyone. I am sick of my doings\nbeing noticed and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,\u2019 he added as an\nafterthought, \u2018we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for\nbeing so late.

Frodo hesitated for a\nsecond: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire\nto hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself\ndown in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the\nroad. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the\ngreat roots.\nRound the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-\nsized horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the\nsaddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his"}

From\ninside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive\nscent; the head turned from side to side of the road.\nA sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and\nhe thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire\nto get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to\nmove his hand. He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he\nwould be safe. The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used\nthe Ring. \u2018And I am still in the Shire,\u2019 he thought, as his hand touched\nthe chain on which it hung. At that moment the rider sat up, and\nshook the reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first,\nand then breaking into a quick trot.\nFrodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until\nhe dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it\nseemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse\nturned aside and went into the trees on the right.\n\u2018Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,\u2019 said Frodo\nto himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam\nhad remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo\ndescribed the rider and his strange behaviour.\n\u2018I can\u2019t say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for\nme; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me.\nI\u2019ve never seen or felt anything like it in the Shire before.\u2019\n\u2018But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018And what is he doing in this part of the world?\u2019\n\u2018There are some Men about,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Down in the South-\nfarthing they have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I have\nnever heard of anything like this rider. I wonder where he comes\nfrom.\u2019\n\u2018Begging your pardon,\u2019 put in Sam suddenly, \u2018I know where he\ncomes from. It\u2019s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes,\nunless there\u2019s more than one. And I know where he\u2019s going to.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Frodo sharply, looking at him in aston-\nishment. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you speak up before?\u2019\n\u2018I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back\nto our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me:\nHallo, Sam! he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this\nmorning. There\u2019s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag\nEnd, and he\u2019s only just gone. I\u2019ve sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I\nliked the sound of him.

They were now silent, and as the last Elf\npassed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed.\n\u2018Hail, Frodo!\u2019 he cried. \u2018You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps\nlost?\u2019 Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped\nand gathered round.\n\u2018This is indeed wonderful!\u2019 they said. \u2018Three hobbits in a wood at\nnight! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What\nis the meaning of it?\u2019\n\u2018The meaning of it, fair people,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018is simply that we\nseem to be going the same way as you are. I like walking under the\nstars. But I would welcome your company.\u2019\n\u2018But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,\u2019\nthey laughed. \u2018And how do you know that we go the same way as\nyou, for you do not know whither we are going?\u2019\n\u2018And how do you know my name?\u2019 asked Frodo in return.\n\u2018We know many things,\u2019 they said. \u2018We have seen you often before\nwith Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.\u2019\n\u2018Who are you, and who is your lord?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018I am Gildor,\u2019 answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed\nhim. \u2018Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles, and\nmost of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only\ntarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some of\nour kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell\nus what you are doing? For we see that there is some shadow of fear\nupon you.\u2019\n\u2018O Wise People!\u2019 interrupted Pippin eagerly. \u2018Tell us about the\nBlack Riders!\u2019\n\u2018Black Riders?\u2019 they said in low voices. \u2018Why do you ask about\nBlack Riders?\u2019\n\u2018Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has\ndone so twice,\u2019 said Pippin; \u2018only a little while ago he slipped away\nas you drew near.\u2019\nThe Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in\ntheir own tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. \u2018We will\nnot speak of this here,\u2019 he said. \u2018We think you had best come now\nwith us. It is not our custom, but for this time we will take you on\nour road, and you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.\u2019"}
{"105": "Frodo bowing. \u2018Elen s\u00b4\u0131la lu\u00b4menn\u2019 omentielvo, a star shines on the hour\nof our meeting,\u2019 he added in the High-elven speech.\n\u2018Be careful, friends!\u2019 cried Gildor laughing. \u2018Speak no secrets! Here\nis a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail,\nElf-friend!\u2019 he said, bowing to Frodo. \u2018Come now with your friends\nand join our company! You had best walk in the middle so that you\nmay not stray. You may be weary before we halt.\u2019\n\u2018Why? Where are you going?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It\nis some miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will\nshorten your journey tomorrow.\u2019\nThey now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows\nand faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when\nthey wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel\nsleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his\nside put out his arm and saved him from a fall. Sam walked along\nat Frodo\u2019s side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face half\nof fear and half of astonished joy.\nThe woods on either side became denser; the trees were now\nyounger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a\nfold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising\nslopes at either hand. At last the Elves turned aside from the path. A\ngreen ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right; and this\nthey followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the\ntop of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the\nriver-valley. Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, and\nbefore them lay a wide space of grass, grey under the night. On three\nsides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeply\nand the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the slope, were\nbelow their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars.\nNearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall.\nThe Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they\nseemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo and his com-\npanions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness\nstole over them. The night grew on, and the lights in the valley went\nout. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.\nAway high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and\nslowly above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire.\nThen by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil,\nand there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the\nSwordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves"}
{"106": "\u2018Come!\u2019 the Elves called to the hobbits. \u2018Come! Now is the time\nfor speech and merriment!\u2019\nPippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. \u2018There is a fire in\nthe hall, and food for hungry guests,\u2019 said an Elf standing before him.\nAt the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There\nthe green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like\na hall, roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like\npillars down each side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing,\nand upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were\nburning steadily. The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon\nthe sawn rings of old trunks. Some went to and fro bearing cups and\npouring drink; others brought food on heaped plates and dishes.\n\u2018This is poor fare,\u2019 they said to the hobbits; \u2018for we are lodging in\nthe greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home,\nwe will treat you better.\u2019\n\u2018It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,\u2019 said Frodo.\nPippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his\nmind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of\nvoices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But\nhe remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair\nwhite loaf to one who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and\nricher than the tended fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was\nfilled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a\nsummer afternoon.\nSam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself,\nwhat he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory\nas one of the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to\nsay: \u2018Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a\ngardener. But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know\nwhat I mean.\u2019\nFrodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind\nwas chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech\nand listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served\nhim and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him\nand said laughing: \u2018Here is a jewel among hobbits!\u2019\nAfter a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne\naway to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed\nand slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master.\nWhen Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo\u2019s feet,\nwhere at last he nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained long\nawake, talking with Gildor."}
{"107": "The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the\nwars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the\nquestion that was nearest to his heart:\n\u2018Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?\u2019\nGildor smiled. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he answered. \u2018Twice. He said farewell to us\non this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.\u2019 He would\nsay no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.\n\u2018You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,\u2019\nsaid Gildor. \u2018But I already know a little, and I can read more in your\nface and in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the\nShire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accom-\nplish what you intend, or that you will ever return. Is not that so?\u2019\n\u2018It is,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but I thought my going was a secret known\nonly to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.\u2019 He looked down at Sam, who\nwas snoring gently.\n\u2018The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,\u2019 said Gildor.\n\u2018The Enemy?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Then you know why I am leaving the\nShire?\u2019\n\u2018I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,\u2019\nanswered Gildor; \u2018but I perceive that he is \u2013 strange indeed though\nthat seems to me. And I warn you that peril is now both before you\nand behind you, and upon either side.\u2019\n\u2018You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the\nEnemy. What are the Black Riders?\u2019\n\u2018Has Gandalf told you nothing?\u2019\n\u2018Nothing about such creatures.\u2019\n\u2018Then I think it is not for me to say more \u2013 lest terror should keep\nyou from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only\njust in time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and\nneither stay nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to\nyou.\u2019\n\u2018I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than\nyour hints and warnings,\u2019 exclaimed Frodo. \u2018I knew that danger lay\nahead, of course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire.\nCan\u2019t a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace?\u2019\n\u2018But it is not your own Shire,\u2019 said Gildor. \u2018Others dwelt here\nbefore hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are\nno more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in,\nbut you cannot for ever fence it out.\u2019\n\u2018I know \u2013 and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What\ncan I do now?

{"108": "think the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire\nclearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason\nfor your flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your\npursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose\nthat you will see him before you leave the Shire?\u2019\n\u2018I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I\nhave been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come\nto Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared.\nNow I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait for\nhim?\u2019\nGildor was silent for a moment. \u2018I do not like this news,\u2019 he said\nat last. \u2018That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is\nsaid: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and\nquick to anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.\u2019\n\u2018And it is also said,\u2019 answered Frodo: \u2018Go not to the Elves for counsel,\nfor they will say both no and yes.\u2019\n\u2018Is it indeed?\u2019 laughed Gildor. \u2018Elves seldom give unguarded\nadvice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise,\nand all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told\nme all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better than\nyou? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship\u2019s sake give it. I\nthink you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does\nnot come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone.\nTake such friends as are trusty and willing. Now you should be\ngrateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have their\nown labours and their own sorrows, and they are little concerned\nwith the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. Our\npaths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there\nmay be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I\nfear to say too much.\u2019\n\u2018I am deeply grateful,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but I wish you would tell me\nplainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice I may not see\nGandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger\nthat pursues me.\u2019\n\u2018Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?\u2019\nanswered Gildor. \u2018Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are\ndeadly. Ask no more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is\nended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things\nthan Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!\u2019\n\u2018But where shall I find courage?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018That is what I\nchiefly need.\u2019\n\u2018Courage is found in unlikely places,\u2019 said Gildor. \u2018Be of good"}
{"109": "shall know of your journey, and those that have power for good shall\nbe on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; and may the stars shine upon\nthe end of your road!

{"110": "Chapter 4\nA SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS\nIn the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made\nby a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his\nbed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The\nsun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still green\nupon the tree. He jumped up and went out.\nSam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin\nwas standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the\nElves.\n\u2018They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Come\nand have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did\nlast night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.\u2019\nFrodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. \u2018What is the plan\nfor today?\u2019 asked Pippin.\n\u2018To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,\u2019 answered Frodo,\nand gave his attention to the food.\n\u2018Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?\u2019 asked Pippin\ncheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole\ntroop of them did not seem very alarming to him.\n\u2018Yes, probably,\u2019 said Frodo, not liking the reminder. \u2018But I hope\nto get across the river without their seeing us.\u2019\n\u2018Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?\u2019\n\u2018Not much \u2013 only hints and riddles,\u2019 said Frodo evasively.\n\u2018Did you ask about the sniffing?\u2019\n\u2018We didn\u2019t discuss it,\u2019 said Frodo with his mouth full.\n\u2018You should have. I am sure it is very important.\u2019\n\u2018In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,\u2019 said\nFrodo sharply. \u2018And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don\u2019t want to\nanswer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!\u2019\n\u2018Good heavens!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018At breakfast?\u2019 He walked away\ntowards the edge of the green.\nFrom Frodo\u2019s mind the bright morning \u2013 treacherously bright, he\nthought \u2013 had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the\nwords of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was\nrunning on the green turf and singing.\n\u2018No! I could not!\u2019 he said to himself. \u2018It is one thing to take my\nyoung friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry"}
{"111": "even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. I\ndon\u2019t think I ought even to take Sam.\u2019 He looked at Sam Gamgee,\nand discovered that Sam was watching him.\n\u2018Well, Sam!\u2019 he said. \u2018What about it? I am leaving the Shire as\nsoon as ever I can \u2013 in fact I have made up my mind now not even\nto wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.\u2019\n\u2018Very good, sir!\u2019\n\u2018You still mean to come with me?\u2019\n\u2018I do.\u2019\n\u2018It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. It is already dangerous.\nMost likely neither of us will come back.\u2019\n\u2018If you don\u2019t come back, sir, then I shan\u2019t, that\u2019s certain,\u2019 said\nSam. \u2018Don\u2019t you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never\nmean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon; and if any of\nthose Black Riders try to stop him, they\u2019ll have Sam Gamgee to reckon\nwith, I said. They laughed.\u2019\n\u2018Who are they, and what are you talking about?\u2019\n\u2018The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to\nknow you were going away, so I didn\u2019t see the use of denying it.\nWonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!\u2019\n\u2018They are,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Do you like them still, now you have had\na closer view?\u2019\n\u2018They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,\u2019 answered\nSam slowly. \u2018It don\u2019t seem to matter what I think about them. They\nare quite different from what I expected \u2013 so old and young, and so\ngay and sad, as it were.\u2019\nFrodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some\noutward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him.\nIt did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought\nhe knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except\nthat his face was unusually thoughtful.\n\u2018Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now \u2013 now that your wish\nto see them has come true already?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Yes, sir. I don\u2019t know how to say it, but after last night I feel\ndifferent. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going\nto take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can\u2019t turn back.\nIt isn\u2019t to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want \u2013\nI don\u2019t rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before\nthe end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through,\nsir, if you understand me.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a\ngood companion. I am content. We will go together.\u2019"}
{"112": "\u2018All ready to start?\u2019 he said as Pippin ran up. \u2018We must be getting\noff at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.\u2019\n\u2018You slept late, you mean,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I was up long before; and\nwe are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.\u2019\n\u2018I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury\nFerry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to\nthe road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country\nfrom here.\u2019\n\u2018Then you are going to fly,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018You won\u2019t cut straight\non foot anywhere in this country.\u2019\n\u2018We can cut straighter than the road anyway,\u2019 answered Frodo.\n\u2018The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to\nthe left \u2013 you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes\nround the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from\nthe Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out of the way. We could\nsave a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from\nwhere we stand.\u2019\n\u2018Short cuts make long delays,\u2019 argued Pippin. \u2018The country is rough\nround here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in\nthe Marish \u2013 I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying\nabout Black Riders, I can\u2019t see that it is any worse meeting them on\na road than in a wood or a field.\u2019\n\u2018It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,\u2019 answered\nFrodo. \u2018And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some\nchance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.\u2019\n\u2018All right!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I will follow you into every bog and ditch.\nBut it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock\nbefore sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it\nis a long time since I tasted it.\u2019\n\u2018That settles it!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Short cuts make delays, but inns\nmake longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from the\nGolden Perch. We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do\nyou say, Sam?\u2019\n\u2018I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam (in spite of private\nmisgivings and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).\n\u2018Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let\u2019s go now!\u2019\nsaid Pippin.\nIt was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but\nclouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to\nturn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and\nplunged into the thick trees below. Their course had been chosen to"}
{"113": "the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry over\ncountry that was open, except for a few ditches and fences. Frodo\nreckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.\nHe soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than\nit had appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they\ndid not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of\nthe bank, they found a stream running down from the hills behind\nin a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles.\nMost inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen. They\ncould not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting\nwet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering what to do.\n\u2018First check!\u2019 said Pippin, smiling grimly.\nSam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he\ncaught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had\nclimbed down.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and\non the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing.\nBeside it stooped a black figure.\nThey at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way,\nand plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. \u2018Whew!\u2019\nhe said to Pippin. \u2018We were both right! The short cut has gone\ncrooked already; but we got under cover only just in time. You\u2019ve\ngot sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?\u2019\nThey stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but\nthere was no sound of pursuit. \u2018I don\u2019t fancy he would try bringing\nhis horse down that bank,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But I guess he knows we came\ndown it. We had better be going on.\u2019\nGoing on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and\nthe bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They\nwere cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still\nand stuffy. When they forced their way at last into more open ground,\nthey were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were also no\nlonger certain of the direction in which they were going. The banks\nof the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and\nshallower, wandering off towards the Marish and the River.\n\u2018Why, this is the Stock-brook!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018If we are going to try\nand get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.\u2019\nThey waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space,\nrush-grown and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came\nagain to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and\nthere an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly level, and there\nwas little undergrowth; but the trees were too close for them to see"}
{"114": "away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fast\nas they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of old\nleaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did\nnot talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.\nAfter half an hour Pippin said: \u2018I hope we have not turned too\nmuch towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this\nwood! It is not a very broad belt \u2013 I should have said no more than\na mile at the widest \u2013 and we ought to have been through it by now.\u2019\n\u2018It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018That\nwon\u2019t mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure\nthat I want to come out into the open yet.\u2019\nThey went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun\ngleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now\npast mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted\nunder an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still\nthick, and the ground at its feet was fairly dry and sheltered. When\nthey came to make their meal, they found that the Elves had filled\ntheir bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent\nof a honey made of many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing.\nVery soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, and\nat Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind\nthem.\nFrodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes.\nSam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing\nsoftly:\nHo! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go\nTo heal my heart and drown my woe.\nRain may fall and wind may blow,\nAnd many miles be still to go,\nBut under a tall tree I will lie,\nAnd let the clouds go sailing by.\nHo! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly.\nFrodo sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind,\nlike the cry of some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and\nended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if\nsuddenly frozen, it was answered by another cry, fainter and further\noff, but no less chilling to the blood. There was then a silence, broken\nonly by the sound of the wind in the leaves.\n\u2018And what do you think that was?\u2019 Pippin asked at last, trying to"}
{"115": "\u2018It was not bird or beast,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It was a call, or a signal \u2013\nthere were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no\nhobbit has such a voice.\u2019\nNo more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders,\nbut no one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stay\nor go on; but sooner or later they had got to get across the open\ncountry to the Ferry, and it was best to go sooner and in daylight.\nIn a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were\noff.\nBefore long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands\nstretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned\ntoo much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the\nlow hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now to their left.\nCreeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees, they set off across\nthe open as quickly as they could.\nAt first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far\nback behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted.\nFrodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on\nthe ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun\nescaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they\nhad left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though\nthey still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and\nwell-ordered. Soon they came into well-tended fields and meadows:\nthere were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage. Everything\nseemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Their\nspirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; and\nthe Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left\nfar behind.\nThey passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a\nstout gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges\ntowards a distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped.\n\u2018I know these fields and this gate!\u2019 he said. \u2018This is Bamfurlong,\nold Farmer Maggot\u2019s land. That\u2019s his farm away there in the trees.\u2019\n\u2018One trouble after another!\u2019 said Frodo, looking nearly as much\nalarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a\ndragon\u2019s den. The others looked at him in surprise.\n\u2018What\u2019s wrong with old Maggot?\u2019 asked Pippin. \u2018He\u2019s a good friend\nto all the Brandybucks. Of course he\u2019s a terror to trespassers, and\nkeeps ferocious dogs \u2013 but after all, folk down here are near the\nborder and have to be more on their guard.\u2019\n\u2018I know,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But all the same,\u2019 he added with a shame-"}
{"116": "mushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last\noccasion he beat me, and then took me and showed me to his dogs.\n\u2018\u2018See, lads,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018next time this young varmint sets foot on my\nland, you can eat him. Now see him off !\u2019\u2019 They chased me all the\nway to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright \u2013 though I daresay\nthe beasts knew their business and would not really have touched\nme.\u2019\nPippin laughed. \u2018Well, it\u2019s time you made it up. Especially if you\nare coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout\nfellow \u2013 if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let\u2019s get into the lane\nand then we shan\u2019t be trespassing. If we meet him, I\u2019ll do the talking.\nHe is a friend of Merry\u2019s, and I used to come here with him a good\ndeal at one time.\u2019\nThey went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a\nlarge house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead.\nThe Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabi-\ntants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly\nbuilt of brick and had a high wall all round it. There was a wide\nwooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane.\nSuddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke\nout, and a loud voice was heard shouting: \u2018Grip! Fang! Wolf ! Come\non, lads!\u2019\nFrodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces.\nThe gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane,\nand dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no\nnotice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-\nlooking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved.\nThe largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo,\nbristling and growling.\nThrough the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit\nwith a round red face. \u2018Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and what\nmay you be wanting?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!\u2019 said Pippin.\nThe farmer looked at him closely. \u2018Well, if it isn\u2019t Master Pippin\n\u2013 Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!\u2019 he cried, changing from a scowl\nto a grin. \u2018It\u2019s a long time since I saw you round here. It\u2019s lucky for\nyou that I know you. I was just going out to set my dogs on any\nstrangers. There are some funny things going on today. Of course,\nwe do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times. Too near\nthe River,\u2019 he said, shaking his head. \u2018But this fellow was the most\noutlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won\u2019t cross my land without"}
{"117": "\u2018Then you haven\u2019t seen him?\u2019 said the farmer. \u2018He went up the\nlane towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny\ncustomer and asking funny questions. But perhaps you\u2019ll come along\ninside, and we\u2019ll pass the news more comfortable. I\u2019ve a drop of good\nale on tap, if you and your friends are willing, Mr. Took.\u2019\nIt seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed\nto do it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation.\n\u2018What about the dogs?\u2019 asked Frodo anxiously.\nThe farmer laughed. \u2018They won\u2019t harm you \u2013 not unless I tell \u2019em\nto. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Heel, Wolf !\u2019 To the relief of\nFrodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.\nPippin introduced the other two to the farmer. \u2018Mr. Frodo Baggins,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy\nHall.\u2019 At the name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a\nsharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen\nmushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs would be told to\nsee him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the arm.\n\u2018Well, if that isn\u2019t queerer than ever!\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018Mr. Baggins\nis it? Come inside! We must have a talk.\u2019\nThey went into the farmer\u2019s kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place.\nMrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large\nmugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than\ncompensated for missing the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer sus-\npiciously. He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts\nof the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with\nanyone who had beaten his master, however long ago.\nAfter a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural pros-\npects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down\nhis mug and looked at them all in turn.\n\u2018Now, Mr. Peregrin,\u2019 he said, \u2018where might you be coming from,\nand where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit me? For,\nif so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.\u2019\n\u2018Well, no,\u2019 answered Pippin. \u2018To tell you the truth, since you have\nguessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come\nover your fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in\nthe woods, back near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the\nFerry.\u2019\n\u2018If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,\u2019\nsaid the farmer. \u2018But I wasn\u2019t worrying about that. You have leave\nto walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you,\nMr. Baggins \u2013 though I daresay you still like mushrooms.\u2019 He laughed.\n\u2018Ah yes, I recognized the name. I recollect the time when young"}
{"118": "Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that funny customer\nasked me?\u2019\nThey waited anxiously for him to go on. \u2018Well,\u2019 the farmer con-\ntinued, approaching his point with slow relish, \u2018he came riding on a\nbig black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right\nup to my door. All black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded\nup, as if he did not want to be known. \u2018\u2018Now what in the Shire can\nhe want?\u2019\u2019 I thought to myself. We don\u2019t see many of the Big Folk\nover the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black\nfellow.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Good-day to you!\u2019\u2019 I says, going out to him. \u2018\u2018This lane don\u2019t\nlead anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way\nwill be back to the road.\u2019\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the looks of him; and when\nGrip came out, he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been\nstung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling. The black fellow\nsat quite still.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I come from yonder,\u2019\u2019 he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back\nwest, over my fields, if you please. \u2018\u2018Have you seen Baggins?\u2019\u2019 he\nasked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see\nany face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver\ndown my back. But I did not see why he should come riding over\nmy land so bold.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Be off !\u2019\u2019 I said. \u2018\u2018There are no Bagginses here. You\u2019re in the\nwrong part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton\n\u2013 but you can go by road this time.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Baggins has left,\u2019\u2019 he answered in a whisper. \u2018\u2018He is coming. He\nis not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I\nwill come back with gold.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018No you won\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 I said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019ll go back where you belong,\ndouble quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might\nnot. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out\nof the way only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and\nrode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a\nbolt of thunder. What do you think of that?\u2019\nFrodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought\nwas how on earth would they reach the Ferry. \u2018I don\u2019t know what\nto think,\u2019 he said at last.\n\u2018Then I\u2019ll tell you what to think,\u2019 said Maggot. \u2018You should never\nhave gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk\nare queer up there.\u2019 Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer\nwith an unfriendly eye. \u2018But you were always a reckless lad. When I"}

Maybe there\nis some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels\nthat he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?\u2019\nFrodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather\ndisconcerting.\n\u2018Well, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 Maggot went on, \u2018I\u2019m glad that you\u2019ve had the\nsense to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don\u2019t\nget mixed up with these outlandish folk. You\u2019ll have friends in these\nparts. If any of these black fellows come after you again, I\u2019ll deal\nwith them. I\u2019ll say you\u2019re dead, or have left the Shire, or anything\nyou like. And that might be true enough; for as like as not it is old\nMr. Bilbo they want news of.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe you\u2019re right,\u2019 said Frodo, avoiding the farmer\u2019s eye and\nstaring at the fire.\nMaggot looked at him thoughtfully. \u2018Well, I see you have ideas of\nyour own,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought\nyou and that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news\nwas no great news to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me\nanything you have a mind to keep to yourself; but I see you are in\nsome kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking it won\u2019t be too easy\nto get to the Ferry without being caught?\u2019\n\u2018I was thinking so,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But we have got to try and get\nthere; and it won\u2019t be done by sitting and thinking. So I am afraid\nwe must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness!\nI\u2019ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer\nMaggot, though you may laugh to hear it. It\u2019s a pity: for I\u2019ve missed\na good friend. And now I\u2019m sorry to leave so soon. But I\u2019ll come\nback, perhaps, one day \u2013 if I get a chance.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll be welcome when you come,\u2019 said Maggot. \u2018But now I\u2019ve\na notion. It\u2019s near sundown already, and we are going to have our\nsupper; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr.\nPeregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us, we would be\npleased!\u2019\n\u2018And so should we!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But we must be going at once,\nI\u2019m afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.\u2019\n\u2018Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper,\nI\u2019ll get out a small waggon, and I\u2019ll drive you all to the Ferry.

There was beer\nin plenty, and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides much\nother solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds\nand cracked bones.\nWhen they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a\nlantern and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the\nguests came out. They threw their packs on board and climbed in.\nThe farmer sat in the driving-seat, and whipped up his two stout\nponies. His wife stood in the light of the open door.\n\u2018You be careful of yourself, Maggot!\u2019 she called. \u2018Don\u2019t go arguing\nwith any foreigners, and come straight back!\u2019\n\u2018I will!\u2019 said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no\nbreath of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was\nin the air. They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile\nor two the lane came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing\na short slope up on to the high-banked causeway.\nMaggot got down and took a good look either way, north and\nsouth, but nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not\na sound in the still air. Thin strands of river-mist were hanging above\nthe dikes, and crawling over the fields.\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be thick,\u2019 said Maggot; \u2018but I\u2019ll not light my lanterns\ntill I turn for home. We\u2019ll hear anything on the road long before we\nmeet it tonight.\u2019\nIt was five miles or more from Maggot\u2019s lane to the Ferry. The\nhobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any\nsound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies\u2019\nhoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him\nPippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards\ninto the rising fog.\nThey reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked\nby two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer\nMaggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They\nwere just beginning to scramble out, when suddenly they heard what\nthey had all been dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was\ncoming towards them.\nMaggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies\u2019 heads, and\npeering forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approach-\ning rider. The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air.\n\u2018You\u2019d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam anxiously. \u2018You"}

The advancing hoofs stopped\nshort. They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in\nthe mist, a yard or two ahead.\n\u2018Now then!\u2019 said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and striding\nforward. \u2018Don\u2019t you come a step nearer! What do you want, and\nwhere are you going?\u2019\n\u2018I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?\u2019 said a muffled voice \u2013\nbut the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern\nwas uncovered, and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer.\n\u2018Mr. Merry!\u2019 he cried.\n\u2018Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?\u2019 said Merry coming\nforward. As he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he\nseemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding\na pony, and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin to\nkeep out the fog.\nFrodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. \u2018So there you are\nat last!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I was beginning to wonder if you would turn\nup at all today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew\nfoggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you had\nfallen in any ditches. But I\u2019m blest if I know which way you have\ncome. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duck-pond?\u2019\n\u2018No, I caught \u2019em trespassing,\u2019 said the farmer, \u2018and nearly set my\ndogs on \u2019em; but they\u2019ll tell you all the story, I\u2019ve no doubt. Now,\nif you\u2019ll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I\u2019d best be\nturning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night\ngetting thick.\u2019\nHe backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. \u2018Well, good\nnight to you all,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s been a queer day, and no mistake. But\nall\u2019s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until\nwe reach our own doors. I\u2019ll not deny that I\u2019ll be glad now when I\ndo.\u2019 He lit his lanterns, and got up. Suddenly he produced a large\nbasket from under the seat. \u2018I was nearly forgetting,\u2019 he said. \u2018Mrs.\nMaggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.\u2019 He\nhanded it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of thanks and\ngood-nights.\nThey watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they\ndwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the\ncovered basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising."}
{"122": "Chapter 5\nA CONSPIRACY UNMASKED\n\u2018Now we had better get home ourselves,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018There\u2019s some-\nthing funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.\u2019\nThey turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept\nand edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards or so\nit brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad wooden\nlanding-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white\nbollards near the water\u2019s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps\non high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat fields were now\nabove the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a\nfew curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank. There\nseemed to be less fog on the further side.\nMerry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others\nfollowed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandy-\nwine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank\nwas steep, and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing.\nLamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and\nout of it, through stray shrouds of mist, shone many round windows,\nyellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancient\nhome of the Brandybucks.\nLong ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one\nof the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the\nriver, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He\nbuilt (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck,\nand settled down to become master of what was virtually a small\nindependent country. His family grew and grew, and after his days\ncontinued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low\nhill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about a\nhundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous dependants\nthen began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was\nthe origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river\nand the Old Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village\nwas Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy\nHall.\nThe people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and\ntheauthorityoftheMasteroftheHall(astheheadoftheBrandybuck"}
{"123": "the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a\nmatter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits of\nthe Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats,\nand some of them could swim.\nTheir land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that\nside they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many\ngenerations ago, and was now thick and tall, for it was constantly\ntended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop\ncurving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle\nflowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over twenty miles\nfrom end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection.\nThe Forest drew close to the hedge in many places. The Bucklanders\nkept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in the\nShire.\nThe ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore\ndrew nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not\nbeen over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slow\ngurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark\nadventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had\na passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly at\nBag End.\nThe four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and\nPippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who\nhad been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a\nhoarse whisper:\n\u2018Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?\u2019\nOn the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make\nout a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as\nthey looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if\nsearching the ground. It then crawled, or went crouching, back into\nthe gloom beyond the lamps.\n\u2018What in the Shire is that?\u2019 exclaimed Merry.\n\u2018Something that is following us,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But don\u2019t ask any\nmore now! Let\u2019s get away at once!\u2019 They hurried up the path to the\ntop of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded\nin mist, and nothing could be seen.\n\u2018Thank goodness you don\u2019t keep any boats on the west-bank!\u2019 said\nFrodo. \u2018Can horses cross the river?\u2019\n\u2018They can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge \u2013 or they\nmight swim,\u2019 answered Merry. \u2018Though I never heard of any horse\nswimming the Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?\u2019"}
{"124": "tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We\u2019ll see about supper and\nthings.\u2019\n\u2018We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but\nwe could do with another.\u2019\n\u2018You shall have it! Give me that basket!\u2019 said Merry, and rode\nahead into the darkness.\nIt was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo\u2019s new house\nat Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left,\nand on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland\nthat ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they\ncame to a lane opening on their right. This they followed for a couple\nof miles as it climbed up and down into the country.\nAt last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could\nbe seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the\nmiddle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees\ninside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an\nout-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other dwell-\nings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It had\nbeen built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use of\nguests, or members of the family that wished to escape from the\ncrowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old-fashioned\ncountrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long\nand low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round\nwindows, and a large round door.\nAs they walked up the green path from the gate no light was visible;\nthe windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door,\nand Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They\nslipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside. They\nwere in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a\npassage ran back down the middle of the house.\n\u2018Well, what do you think of it?\u2019 asked Merry coming up the passage.\n\u2018We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After\nall Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.\u2019\nFrodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own\nfavourite things \u2013 or Bilbo\u2019s things (they reminded him sharply of\nhim in their new setting) \u2013 were arranged as nearly as possible as\nthey had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming\nplace; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here\nto settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair to have put his\nfriends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going\nto break the news to them that he must leave them so soon, indeed"}
{"125": "\u2018It\u2019s delightful!\u2019 he said with an effort. \u2018I hardly feel that I have\nmoved at all.\u2019\nThe travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the\nfloor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at\nthe far end. Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.\n\u2018A bath!\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018O blessed Meriadoc!\u2019\n\u2018Which order shall we go in?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Eldest first, or quickest\nfirst? You\u2019ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.\u2019\n\u2018Trust me to arrange things better than that!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We\ncan\u2019t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room\nthere are three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also\ntowels, mats and soap. Get inside, and be quick!\u2019\nMerry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the\npassage, and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late\nsupper. Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed\nwith the sound of splashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippin\nwas suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo\u2019s favourite\nbath-songs.\nSing hey! for the bath at close of day\nthat washes the weary mud away!\nA loon is he that will not sing:\nO! Water Hot is a noble thing!\nO! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,\nand the brook that leaps from hill to plain;\nbut better than rain or rippling streams\nis Water Hot that smokes and steams.\nO! Water cold we may pour at need\ndown a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;\nbut better is Beer, if drink we lack,\nand Water Hot poured down the back.\nO! Water is fair that leaps on high\nin a fountain white beneath the sky;\nbut never did fountain sound so sweet\nas splashing Hot Water with my feet!\nThere was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo.

{"126": "Merry went to the door: \u2018What about supper and beer in the\nthroat?\u2019 he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.\n\u2018There\u2019s so much water in the air that I\u2019m coming into the kitchen\nto finish,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Lawks!\u2019 said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming.\n\u2018You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat, Peregrin,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Hurry up, or we shan\u2019t wait for you.\u2019\nThey had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. \u2018I suppose\nyou three won\u2019t want mushrooms again?\u2019 said Fredegar without much\nhope.\n\u2018Yes we shall!\u2019 cried Pippin.\n\u2018They\u2019re mine!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queen\namong farmers\u2019 wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I\u2019ll serve\nthem.\u2019\nHobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the\ngreediest likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young\nFrodo\u2019s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and\nthe wrath of the injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty\nfor all, even according to hobbit standards. There were also many\nother things to follow, and when they had finished even Fatty Bolger\nheaved a sigh of content. They pushed back the table, and drew\nchairs round the fire.\n\u2018We\u2019ll clear up later,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Now tell me all about it! I\nguess that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair\nwithout me. I want a full account; and most of all I want to know\nwhat was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like\nthat. He sounded almost as if he was scared, if that is possible.\u2019\n\u2018We have all been scared,\u2019 said Pippin after a pause, in which\nFrodo stared at the fire and did not speak. \u2018You would have been,\ntoo, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.\u2019\n\u2018And what are they?\u2019\n\u2018Black figures riding on black horses,\u2019 answered Pippin. \u2018If Frodo\nwon\u2019t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.\u2019 He then\ngave a full account of their journey from the time when they left\nHobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations.\nFrodo remained silent.\n\u2018I should think you were making it all up,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018if I had\nnot seen that black shape on the landing-stage \u2013 and heard the queer\nsound in Maggot\u2019s voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?\u2019\n\u2018Cousin Frodo has been very close,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018But the time has\ncome for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more"}
{"127": "\u2018That was only a guess,\u2019 said Frodo hastily. \u2018Maggot does not know\nanything.\u2019\n\u2018Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018A lot goes on behind\nhis round face that does not come out in his talk. I\u2019ve heard that he\nused to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation\nof knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us,\nFrodo, whether you think his guess good or bad.\u2019\n\u2018I think,\u2019 answered Frodo slowly, \u2018that it was a good guess, as far\nas it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo\u2019s old adventures, and the\nRiders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or\nfor me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and\nthat I am not safe here or anywhere else.\u2019 He looked round at the\nwindows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way.\nThe others looked at him in silence, and exchanged meaning glances\namong themselves.\n\u2018It\u2019s coming out in a minute,\u2019 whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry\nnodded.\n\u2018Well!\u2019 said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as\nif he had made a decision. \u2018I can\u2019t keep it dark any longer. I have\ngot something to tell you all. But I don\u2019t know quite how to begin.\u2019\n\u2018I think I could help you,\u2019 said Merry quietly, \u2018by telling you some\nof it myself.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Frodo, looking at him anxiously.\n\u2018Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don\u2019t\nknow how to say good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course.\nBut danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now\nyou are making up your mind to go at once. And you don\u2019t want to.\nWe are very sorry for you.\u2019\nFrodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise\nwas so comical that they laughed. \u2018Dear old Frodo!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Did\nyou really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not\nbeen nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviously\nbeen planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this\nyear since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: \u2018\u2018Shall I\never look down into that valley again, I wonder\u2019\u2019, and things like\nthat. And pretending that you had come to the end of your money,\nand actually selling your beloved Bag End to those Sackville-\nBagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.\u2019\n\u2018Good heavens!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I thought I had been both careful\nand clever. I don\u2019t know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire\ndiscussing my departure then?\u2019\n\u2018Oh no!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about that! The secret won\u2019t"}

I thought you would go after him\nsooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we\nhave been very anxious. We have been terrified that you might give\nus the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Ever\nsince this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal\nof planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so\neasily!\u2019\n\u2018But I must go,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It cannot be helped, dear friends. It\nis wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me.

Merry and I are coming with you.

I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger,\nbut you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-\nback journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\u2019\n\u2018Of course we understand,\u2019 said Merry firmly. \u2018That is why we\nhave decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; but\nwe are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy.\u2019\n\u2018The Ring!\u2019 said Frodo, now completely amazed.\n\u2018Yes, the Ring,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018My dear old hobbit, you don\u2019t allow\nfor the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence\nof the Ring for years \u2013 before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he\nobviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head,\nuntil we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as\nwell as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful\n\u2013 but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I first\nfound out, I will tell you.\u2019\n\u2018Go on!\u2019 said Frodo faintly.\n\u2018It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might\nexpect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking\nalong the road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance\nthe S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and\nthen hey presto! he vanished.

Is\nnothing safe?\u2019\n\u2018Not too safe, I should say,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But I have only had one\nrapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book\nabout. I wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have\nyou got it, Frodo?\u2019\n\u2018No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.\u2019\n\u2018Well, as I was saying,\u2019 Merry proceeded, \u2018I kept my knowledge\nto myself, till this spring when things got serious. Then we formed\nour conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we\nhave not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack,\nand Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief\ninvestigator, I can produce him.\u2019\n\u2018Where is he?\u2019 said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a\nmasked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.\n\u2018Step forward, Sam!\u2019 said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face\nscarlet up to the ears. \u2018Here\u2019s our collector of information! And he\ncollected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After\nwhich, I may say, he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and\ndried up.\u2019\n\u2018Sam!\u2019 cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further,\nand quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved,\nor merely foolish.\n\u2018Yes, sir!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no\nwrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He\nhas some sense, mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no!\ntake someone as you can trust.\u2019\n\u2018But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,\u2019 said Frodo.\nSam looked at him unhappily. \u2018It all depends on what you want,\u2019\nput in Merry. \u2018You can trust us to stick to you through thick and\nthin \u2013 to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of\nyours \u2013 closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to\nlet you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your\nfriends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf\nhas told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly\nafraid \u2013 but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.\u2019\n\u2018And after all, sir,\u2019 added Sam, \u2018you did ought to take the Elves\u2019\nadvice.

I will take Gildor\u2019s advice. If the danger were not so dark,\nI should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier\nthan I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.\u2019\n\u2018Good! That\u2019s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and com-\npany!\u2019 they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin\nbegan a song, which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.\nIt was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on\nhis adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:\nFarewell we call to hearth and hall!\nThough wind may blow and rain may fall,\nWe must away ere break of day\nFar over wood and mountain tall.\nTo Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell\nIn glades beneath the misty fell,\nThrough moor and waste we ride in haste,\nAnd whither then we cannot tell.\nWith foes ahead, behind us dread,\nBeneath the sky shall be our bed,\nUntil at last our toil be passed,\nOur journey done, our errand sped.\nWe must away! We must away!\nWe ride before the break of day!\n\u2018Very good!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But in that case there are a lot of things\nto do before we go to bed \u2013 under a roof, for tonight at any rate.\u2019\n\u2018Oh! That was poetry!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Do you really mean to start\nbefore the break of day?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018I fear those Black Riders, and\nI am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place\nto which it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to\nwait. But I should very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that\neven Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never\nappeared.

Would it be safe to wait one day\nfor Gandalf ?\u2019\n\u2018That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they\nfound you here,\u2019 answered Merry. \u2018They could have reached here by\nnow, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where\nthe Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge.\nThe gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they\nmight break through. Even in the daylight they would try to keep\nthem out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through to\nthe Master of the Hall \u2013 for they would not like the look of the Riders,\nand would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland\ncannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in\nthe morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr.\nBaggins would be let through. It is pretty generally known that you\nare coming back to live at Crickhollow.\u2019\nFrodo sat for a while in thought. \u2018I have made up my mind,\u2019 he\nsaid finally. \u2018I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am\nnot going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go\nthrough the North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known\nat once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be.\nAnd what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will\ncertainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We\ndon\u2019t know how many there are; but there are at least two, and possibly\nmore. The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction.\u2019\n\u2018But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!\u2019 said Fredegar\nhorrified. \u2018You can\u2019t be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous\nas Black Riders.\u2019\n\u2018Not quite,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018It sounds very desperate, but I believe\nFrodo is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed\nat once. With luck we might get a considerable start.\u2019\n\u2018But you won\u2019t have any luck in the Old Forest,\u2019 objected Fredegar.\n\u2018No one ever has luck in there. You\u2019ll get lost. People don\u2019t go in there.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes they do!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018The Brandybucks go in \u2013 occasion-\nally when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went\nin once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight,\nof course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.\u2019\n\u2018Well, do as you think best!\u2019 said Fredegar. \u2018I am more afraid of"}

His family came from the\nEastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never\nbeen over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according to the original\nplans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive\nfolk, and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins\nwas still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old\nclothes of Frodo\u2019s to help him in playing the part. They little thought\nhow dangerous that part might prove.\n\u2018Excellent!\u2019 said Frodo, when he understood the plan. \u2018We could\nnot have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don\u2019t know\nwhether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not\nhave dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searched\nthe house. But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure\nof Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me. I am\ngoing into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow.\u2019\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s that,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018On the whole I would rather have\nour job than Fatty\u2019s \u2013 waiting here till Black Riders come.\u2019\n\u2018You wait till you are well inside the Forest,\u2019 said Fredegar. \u2018You\u2019ll\nwish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s no good arguing about it any more,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We have\nstill got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before\nwe get to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.\u2019\nWhen at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some\ntime. His legs ached. He was glad that he was riding in the morning.\nEventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be\nlooking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down\nbelow among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling\nand snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later.\nThen he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was\na great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that\nit was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had\nnever heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams.\nSuddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after\nall. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the\nair. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone\non a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower\nand see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the"}

The leaves of trees were glistening, and every twig was\ndripping; the grass was grey with cold dew. Everything was still, and\nfar-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard,\nsomeone closing a door of a distant house.\nIn their shed they found the ponies: sturdy little beasts of the kind\nloved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day\u2019s work. They\nmounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed\nto open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them.\nAfter riding for about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw\nthe Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with\nsilver cobwebs.\n\u2018How are you going to get through this?\u2019 asked Fredegar.\n\u2018Follow me!\u2019 said Merry, \u2018and you will see.\u2019 He turned to the left\nalong the Hedge, and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards,\nrunning along the lip of a hollow. A cutting had been made, at some\ndistance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into the\nground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose steadily, until\nsuddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under\nthe Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.\nHere Fatty Bolger halted. \u2018Good-bye, Frodo!\u2019 he said. \u2018I wish you\nwere not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescu-\ning before the day is out. But good luck to you \u2013 today and every\nday!\u2019\n\u2018If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be"}
{"134": "they cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar\u2019s\nsight into the tunnel.\nIt was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of\nthick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when\nthey had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a\nclang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.\n\u2018There!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018You have left the Shire, and are now outside,\nand on the edge of the Old Forest.\u2019\n\u2018Are the stories about it true?\u2019 asked Pippin.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what stories you mean,\u2019 Merry answered. \u2018If you\nmean the old bogey-stories Fatty\u2019s nurses used to tell him, about\ngoblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no. At any\nrate I don\u2019t believe them. But the Forest is queer. Everything in it is\nvery much more alive, more aware of what is going on, so to speak,\nthan things are in the Shire. And the trees do not like strangers. They\nwatch you. They are usually content merely to watch you, as long as\ndaylight lasts, and don\u2019t do much. Occasionally the most unfriendly\nones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with a\nlong trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, or so I am\ntold. I have only once or twice been in here after dark, and then only\nnear the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering to each other,\npassing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and the\nbranches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees\ndo actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In\nfact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted them-\nselves right by it, and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut\ndown hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and\nburned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge. After that\nthe trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly. There\nis still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made.\u2019\n\u2018Is it only the trees that are dangerous?\u2019 asked Pippin.\n\u2018There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on\nthe far side,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018or at least I have heard so; but I have never\nseen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes\ninside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from\ntime to time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or\nwas for a long time, the beginning of quite a broad path leading to\nthe Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east\nand a little north. That is the path I am going to try and find.\u2019\nThe hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide\nhollow. On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor"}
{"135": "could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that\nwere already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see only\ntree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted,\nleaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and all\nthe stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths.\nMerry alone seemed fairly cheerful. \u2018You had better lead on and\nfind that path,\u2019 Frodo said to him. \u2018Don\u2019t let us lose one another, or\nforget which way the Hedge lies!\u2019\nThey picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded\nalong, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots.\nThere was no undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as\nthey went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and\nthicker. There was no sound, except an occasional drip of moisture\nfalling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whisper-\ning or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfort-\nable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening\nto dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found\nthemselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders,\nas if they expected a sudden blow.\nThere was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed\nconstantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not\nbear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout. \u2018Oi! Oi!\u2019 he\ncried. \u2018I am not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will\nyou!\u2019\nThe others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy\ncurtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to\nbecome more crowded and more watchful than before.\n\u2018I should not shout, if I were you,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018It does more harm\nthan good.\u2019\nFrodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through,\nand if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable\nwood. Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed already\nuncertain which way to go. Pippin noticed it. \u2018It has not taken you\nlong to lose us,\u2019 he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistle\nof relief and pointed ahead.\n\u2018Well, well!\u2019 he said. \u2018These trees do shift. There is the Bonfire\nGlade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have\nmoved away!\u2019\nThe light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came\nout of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There\nwasskyabovethem,blueandcleartotheirsurprise,fordownunder"}
{"136": "to shine down into the clearing, though its light was on the tree-tops.\nThe leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade,\nenclosing it with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough\ngrass and many tall plants: stalky and faded hemlocks and wood-\nparsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant nettles and\nthistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden\nafter the close Forest.\nThe hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broad-\nening daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a\nbreak in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see\nit running on into the wood, wide in places and open above, though\nevery now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their\ndark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently,\nbut they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed\nto them that the Forest had relented, and was going to let them pass\nunhindered after all.\nBut after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees\ndrew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far\nahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood\npressing on them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies\u2019 hoofs,\nrustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots,\nseemed to thud in their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage\nthem, but his voice sank to a murmur.\nO! Wanderers in the shadowed land\ndespair not! For though dark they stand,\nall woods there be must end at last,\nand see the open sun go past:\nthe setting sun, the rising sun,\nthe day\u2019s end, or the day begun.\nFor east or west all woods must fail...\nFail \u2013 even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The\nair seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behind\nthem a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash\ninto the path. The trees seemed to close in before them.\n\u2018They do not like all that about ending and failing,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018I should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to the\nedge, and then we\u2019ll turn and give them a rousing chorus!\u2019\nHe spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not\nshow it. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy\nweight was settling steadily on Frodo\u2019s heart, and he regretted now"}
{"137": "going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn.\nThe path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. The\ndark trees drew aside, and ahead they could see the path going almost\nstraight forward. Before them, but some distance off, there stood a\ngreen hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out of the encircling\nwood. The path seemed to be making directly for it.\nThey now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of\nclimbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path\ndipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at last\nto the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the trees and faded into\nthe turf. The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended\nsharply in a circle round a shaven crown.\nThe hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until\nthey reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The\nair was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any\ngreat distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost gone; though\nhere and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south of\nthem, out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest, the fog still\nrose like steam or wisps of white smoke.\n\u2018That,\u2019 said Merry, pointing with his hand, \u2018that is the line of the\nWithywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west\nthrough the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below\nHaysend. We don\u2019t want to go that way! The Withywindle valley is\nsaid to be the queerest part of the whole wood \u2013 the centre from\nwhich all the queerness comes, as it were.\u2019\nThe others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but\nthey could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley;\nand beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view.\nThe sun on the hill-top was now getting hot. It must have been\nabout eleven o\u2019clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from\nseeing much in other directions. In the west they could not make out\neither the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond\nit. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see\nnothing that might be the line of the great East Road, for which they\nwere making. They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizon\nwas veiled.\nOn the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the\nslopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like island-\nshores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters.\nThey sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below\nthem, while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed"}
{"138": "them greatly; for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the\nwood\u2019s borders, though they did not mean to go that way, if they\ncould help it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-\nlegend as the Forest itself.\nAt length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that\nhad brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but\nthey had not followed it far before they became aware that it was\nbending steadily to the right. Soon it began to descend rapidly and\nthey guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withy-\nwindle valley: not at all the direction they wished to take. After some\ndiscussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike north-\nward; for although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top,\nthe Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles off. Also\nnorthward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed to be drier\nand more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner,\nand pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and\nnameless trees of the denser wood.\nAt first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair\nspeed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open\nglade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after\na time the trees began to close in again, just where they had appeared\nfrom a distance to be thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds\nin the ground were discovered unexpectedly, like the ruts of great\ngiant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and\nchoked with brambles. These lay usually right across their line of\nmarch, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again,\nwhich was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time\nthey climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes\nand matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the\nleft, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had\nto go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way\nup the further bank. Each time they clambered out, the trees seemed\ndeeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was most\ndifficult to find a way, and they were forced to the right and\ndownwards.\nAfter an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction,\nthough they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go north-\nward at all. They were being headed off, and were simply following\na course chosen for them \u2013 eastwards and southwards, into the heart\nof the Forest and not out of it."}
{"139": "yet met. It was so steep and overhung that it proved impossible to\nclimb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without leaving\ntheir ponies and their baggage behind. All they could do was to follow\nthe fold \u2013 downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places boggy;\nsprings appeared in the banks, and soon they found themselves fol-\nlowing a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Then\nthe ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and\nnoisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit\ngully over-arched by trees high above them.\nAfter stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came\nquite suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the\nsunlight before them. Coming to the opening they found that they\nhad made their way down through a cleft in a high steep bank, almost\na cliff. At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the\ndistance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep. A golden\nafternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden\nland between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of\nbrown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows,\nblocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded\nwillow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from\nthe branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly\nin the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were\ncreaking.\n\u2018Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!\u2019 said\nMerry. \u2018We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we\nintended. This is the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.\u2019\nHe passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long\ngrasses. After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was\nfairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places\nfirm turf went down to the water\u2019s edge. \u2018What\u2019s more,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this\nside of the river. If we turn left and follow it, we shall be bound to\ncome out on the east side of the Forest eventually.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018That is, if the track goes on so far, and\ndoes not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made\nthe track, do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our\nbenefit. I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in\nit, and I begin to believe all the stories about it. And have you any\nidea how far eastward we should have to go?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018I haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t know in the least how far\ndown the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often\nenough to make a path along it. But there is no other way out that"}
{"140": "to the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses\nwere lush and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found,\nthe path was easy to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the\nsounder ground among the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed\nover other rills, running down gullies into the Withywindle out of\nthe higher forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or\nbundles of brushwood laid carefully across.\nThe hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of\nall kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning\non their backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great\ngrey branches reached across the path. Each step forward became\nmore reluctant than the last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out\nof the ground and up their legs, and falling softly out of the air upon\ntheir heads and eyes.\nFrodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him\nPippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. \u2018It\u2019s no good,\u2019 he\nheard Merry saying. \u2018Can\u2019t go another step without rest. Must have\nnap. It\u2019s cool under the willows. Less flies!\u2019\nFrodo did not like the sound of this. \u2018Come on!\u2019 he cried. \u2018We\ncan\u2019t have a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.\u2019 But the\nothers were too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning\nand blinking stupidly.\nSuddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head\nswam. There now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies had\nstopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft\nfluttering as of a song half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs\nabove. He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge\nwillow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it looked, its sprawling\nbranches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands,\nits knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked\nfaintly as the boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against the bright\nsky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the\ngrass.\nMerry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with\ntheir backs to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks gaped\nwide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They looked\nup at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and\nsinging. They shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they could\nalmost hear words, cool words, saying something about water and\nsleep. They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the\nfoot of the great grey willow."}
{"141": "compelling desire for cool water. \u2018Wait for me, Sam,\u2019 he stammered.\n\u2018Must bathe feet a minute.\u2019\nHalf in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the\ntree, where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled\ndragonets straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and\npaddled his hot feet in the cool brown water; and there he too\nsuddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree.\nSam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern.\nHe was worried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought this\nsudden sleepiness uncanny. \u2018There\u2019s more behind this than sun and\nwarm air,\u2019 he muttered to himself. \u2018I don\u2019t like this great big tree. I\ndon\u2019t trust it. Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won\u2019t do at\nall!\u2019\nHe pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had\nbecome of the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a good\nway along the path; and he had just caught them and brought them\nback towards the others, when he heard two noises; one loud, and\nthe other soft but very clear. One was the splash of something heavy\nfalling into the water; the other was a noise like the snick of a lock\nwhen a door quietly closes fast.\nHe rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the\nedge, and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him\ndown, but he was not struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, and\ndragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty hauled\nhim on to the bank. Almost at once he woke, and coughed and\nspluttered.\n\u2018Do you know, Sam,\u2019 he said at length, \u2018the beastly tree threw me\nin! I felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!\u2019\n\u2018You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018You\nshouldn\u2019t sit in such a place, if you feel sleepy.\u2019\n\u2018What about the others?\u2019 Frodo asked. \u2018I wonder what sort of\ndreams they are having.\u2019\nThey went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam\nunderstood the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The\ncrack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not\na chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack had closed\nabout his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside a\ndark opening, the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers.\nFrodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had\nlain. They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack\nthat held poor Merry. It was quite useless."}
{"142": "Crickhollow!\u2019 He kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his\nown feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up\ninto the branches; the leaves rustled and whispered, but with a sound\nnow of faint and far-off laughter.\n\u2018I suppose we haven\u2019t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?\u2019\nasked Sam.\n\u2018I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018That\nwouldn\u2019t be much use.\u2019\n\u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by fire-\nwood. \u2018We might do something with fire!\u2019\n\u2018We might,\u2019 said Frodo doubtfully. \u2018We might succeed in roasting\nPippin alive inside.\u2019\n\u2018We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,\u2019 said Sam\nfiercely. \u2018If it don\u2019t let them go, I\u2019ll have it down, if I have to gnaw\nit.\u2019 He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-\nboxes and a hatchet.\nQuickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and\nmade a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heaped\nagainst the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. As\nsoon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry\ngrass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled.\nLittle fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient\ntree and scorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. The\nleaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and\nanger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far inside the tree\nthey heard Pippin give a muffled yell.\n\u2018Put it out! Put it out!\u2019 cried Merry. \u2018He\u2019ll squeeze me in two, if\nyou don\u2019t. He says so!\u2019\n\u2018Who? What?\u2019 shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of\nthe tree.\n\u2018Put it out! Put it out!\u2019 begged Merry. The branches of the willow\nbegan to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and\nspreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about,\nas though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the\nriver-valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole\nForest. Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks. But\nFrodo, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hoped\nfor, ran along the path crying help! help! help! It seemed to him that\nhe could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice: it was blown\naway from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamour of\nleaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost\nand witless."}
{"143": "back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there\ncould be no doubt: someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice\nwas singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense:\nHey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!\nRing a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!\nTom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!\nHalf hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam\nnow both stood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words\n(or so they seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into\nthis song:\nHey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling!\nLight goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.\nDown along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,\nWaiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,\nThere my pretty lady is, River-woman\u2019s daughter,\nSlender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.\nOld Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing\nComes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?\nHey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o,\nGoldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!\nPoor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!\nTom\u2019s in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.\nTom\u2019s going home again water-lilies bringing.\nHey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?\nFrodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The\nleaves hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst\nof song, and then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path,\nthere appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown\nand a long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and a\nbound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he\nwas too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one\nof the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, stumping\nalong with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging through\ngrass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat\nand a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face\nwas red as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of\nlaughter. In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small\npile of white water-lilies."}
{"144": "\u2018Whoa! Whoa! steady there!\u2019 cried the old man, holding up one\nhand, and they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. \u2018Now,\nmy little fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows?\nWhat\u2019s the matter here then? Do you know who I am? I\u2019m Tom\nBombadil. Tell me what\u2019s your trouble! Tom\u2019s in a hurry now.

Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I\nknow the tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! I\u2019ll freeze his marrow\ncold, if he don\u2019t behave himself. I\u2019ll sing his roots off. I\u2019ll sing a wind\nup and blow leaf and branch away. Old Man Willow!\u2019\nSetting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the tree.\nThere he saw Merry\u2019s feet still sticking out \u2013 the rest had already\nbeen drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the crack and\nbegan singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the\nwords, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom\nsprang away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of\nthe willow with it. \u2018You let them out again, Old Man Willow!\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018What be you a-thinking of ? You should not be waking. Eat\nearth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!\u2019 He\nthen seized Merry\u2019s feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening\ncrack.\nThere was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out\nof it Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap\nboth cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from\nroot to tip, and complete silence fell.\n\u2018Thank you!\u2019 said the hobbits, one after the other.\nTom Bombadil burst out laughing. \u2018Well, my little fellows!\u2019 said\nhe, stooping so that he peered into their faces. \u2018You shall come home\nwith me! The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and\nwhite bread and butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for ques-\ntions around the supper table. You follow after me as quick as you\nare able!\u2019 With that he picked up his lilies, and then with a beckoning\nwave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward,\nstill singing loudly and nonsensically.\nToo surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after\nhim as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon\ndisappeared in front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter\nand further away. Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in\na loud halloo!"}
{"145": "Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!\nTom\u2019s going on ahead candles for to kindle.\nDown west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.\nWhen the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,\nOut of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.\nFear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!\nFear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.\nHey now! merry dol! We\u2019ll be waiting for you!\nAfter that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun\nseemed to sink into the trees behind them. They thought of the\nslanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the\nwindows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights.\nGreat shadows fell across them; trunks and branches of trees hung\ndark and threatening over the path. White mists began to rise and\ncurl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees\nupon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy\nsteam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.\nIt became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired.\nTheir legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the\nbushes and reeds on either side of them; and if they looked up to\nthe pale sky, they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces\nthat gloomed dark against the twilight, and leered down at them from\nthe high bank and the edges of the wood. They began to feel that all\nthis country was unreal, and that they were stumbling through an\nominous dream that led to no awakening.\nJust as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed\nthat the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. In\nthe darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river\nflowed over a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and\nthe mists were left behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and\nfound a wide sweep of grass welling up before them. The river, now\nsmall and swift, was leaping merrily down to meet them, glinting\nhere and there in the light of the stars, which were already shining\nin the sky.\nThe grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been\nmown or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and\ntrim as a hedge. The path was now plain before them, well-tended\nand bordered with stone. It wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll,\nnow grey under the pale starry night; and there, still high above them\non a further slope, they saw the twinkling lights of a house. Down\nagain the path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillside"}
{"146": "house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep shoulder\nof the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of\nthe Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.\nThey all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their\nweariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry\ndol! rolled out the song to greet them.\nHey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!\nHobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.\nNow let the fun begin! Let us sing together!\nThen another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like\nthe song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright\nmorning in the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:\nNow let the song begin! Let us sing together\nOf sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,\nLight on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,\nWind on the open hill, bells on the heather,\nReeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:\nOld Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!\nAnd with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a\ngolden light was all about them."}
{"147": "Chapter 7\nIN THE HOUSE OF\nTOM BOMBADIL\nThe four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood\nstill, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of\nlamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark\npolished wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.\nIn a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a\nwoman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown\nwas green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew;\nand her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with\nthe pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots. About her feet in wide vessels\nof green and brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so\nthat she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.\n\u2018Enter, good guests!\u2019 she said, and as she spoke they knew that it\nwas her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid\nsteps further into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely\nsurprised and awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to\nbeg for a drink of water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen\nclad in living flowers. But before they could say anything, she sprang\nlightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them;\nand as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering\nborders of a river.\n\u2018Come dear folk!\u2019 she said, taking Frodo by the hand. \u2018Laugh and\nbe merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.\u2019 Then lightly she\npassed them and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her\nwhite arms spread out across it. \u2018Let us shut out the night!\u2019 she said.\n\u2018For you are still afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep\nwater, and untame things. Fear nothing! For tonight you are under\nthe roof of Tom Bombadil.\u2019\nThe hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of\nthem and smiled. \u2018Fair lady Goldberry!\u2019 said Frodo at last, feeling\nhis heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as\nhe had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell\nthat was now laid upon him was different: less keen and lofty was\nthe delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart; marvellous and\nyet not strange. \u2018Fair lady Goldberry!\u2019 he said again. \u2018Now the joy"}
{"148": "O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!\nO reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!\nO spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!\nO wind on the waterfall, and the leaves\u2019 laughter!\u2019\nSuddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear\nhimself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.\n\u2018Welcome!\u2019 she said. \u2018I had not heard that folk of the Shire were\nso sweet-tongued. But I see that you are an Elf-friend; the light in\nyour eyes and the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting!\nSit now, and wait for the Master of the house! He will not be long.\nHe is tending your tired beasts.\u2019\nThe hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Gold-\nberry busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for\nthe slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight.\nFrom somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing. Every\nnow and again they caught, among many a derry dol and a merry dol\nand a ring a ding dillo the repeated words:\nOld Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;\nBright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.\n\u2018Fair lady!\u2019 said Frodo again after a while. \u2018Tell me, if my asking\ndoes not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?\u2019\n\u2018He is,\u2019 said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.\nFrodo looked at her questioningly. \u2018He is, as you have seen him,\u2019\nshe said in answer to his look. \u2018He is the Master of wood, water, and\nhill.\u2019\n\u2018Then all this strange land belongs to him?\u2019\n\u2018No indeed!\u2019 she answered, and her smile faded. \u2018That would\nindeed be a burden,\u2019 she added in a low voice, as if to herself. \u2018The\ntrees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land\nbelong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one\nhas ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water,\nleaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom\nBombadil is master.\u2019\nA door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat\nand his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He\nlaughed, and going to Goldberry, took her hand.\n\u2018Here\u2019s my pretty lady!\u2019 he said, bowing to the hobbits. \u2018Here\u2019s\nmy Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle!\nIs the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white"}
{"149": "\u2018It is,\u2019 said Goldberry; \u2018but the guests perhaps are not?\u2019\nTom clapped his hands and cried: \u2018Tom, Tom! your guests are\ntired, and you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and\nTom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your\nweary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!\u2019\nHe opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage\nand round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping\nroof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house).\nIts walls were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green\nhanging mats and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn\nwith fresh green rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled\nwith white blankets, laid on the floor along one side. Against the\nopposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins,\nand beside it stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, some\nsteaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside each\nbed.\nBefore long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the\ntable, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and the\nMaster. It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as\nonly famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their\ndrinking-bowls seemed to be clear cold water, yet it went to their\nhearts like wine and set free their voices. The guests became suddenly\naware that they were singing merrily, as if it was easier and more\nnatural than talking.\nAt last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The\nguests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each\nwith a footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth\nbefore them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built\nof apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in\nthe room were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at\neach end of the chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood\nbefore them, holding a candle; and she wished them each a good\nnight and deep sleep.\n\u2018Have peace now,\u2019 she said, \u2018until the morning! Heed no nightly\nnoises! For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight\nand starlight and the wind off the hill-top. Good night!\u2019 She passed\nout of the room with a glimmer and a rustle. The sound of her\nfootsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool\nstones in the quiet of night.\nTom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them\ntried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had"}
{"150": "\u2018Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought\nyou at that moment?\u2019\nTom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. \u2018Eh, what?\u2019\nsaid he. \u2018Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy\nsinging. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was\nno plan of mine, though I was waiting for you. We heard news of\nyou, and learned that you were wandering. We guessed you\u2019d come\nere long down to the water: all paths lead that way, down to Withy-\nwindle. Old grey Willow-man, he\u2019s a mighty singer; and it\u2019s hard for\nlittle folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there,\nthat he dared not hinder.\u2019 Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him\nagain; but he went on in a soft singing voice:\nI had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,\ngreen leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,\nthe last ere the year\u2019s end to keep them from the winter,\nto flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted.\nEach year at summer\u2019s end I go to find them for her,\nin a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;\nthere they open first in spring and there they linger latest.\nBy that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,\nfair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.\nSweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!\nHe opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:\nAnd that proved well for you \u2013 for now I shall no longer\ngo down deep again along the forest-water,\nnot while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing\nOld Man Willow\u2019s house this side of spring-time,\nnot till the merry spring, when the River-daughter\ndances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.\nHe fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more\nquestion: the one he most desired to have answered. \u2018Tell us, Master,\u2019\nhe said, \u2018about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of\nhim before.\u2019\n\u2018No, don\u2019t!\u2019 said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly\nupright. \u2018Not now! Not until the morning!\u2019\n\u2018That is right!\u2019 said the old man. \u2018Now is the time for resting.\nSome things are ill to hear when the world\u2019s in shadow. Sleep till the\nmorning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no"}
{"151": "Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets\nwere of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep\nbeds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep.\nIn the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he\nsaw the young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before\nhim a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It\nseemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that\nthe rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, and\nin the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower\nbut not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. The\nmoon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and\nglistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the dark\nplain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many\nwolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed\nacross the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from\nthe staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him\naway. The voices wailed and the wolves yammered. There was a\nnoise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne the sound of\nhoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. \u2018Black Riders!\u2019\nthought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echo-\ning in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the courage\nto leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still listen-\ning; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again\nor wandered into some other unremembered dream.\nAt his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came\nover his dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or\nthought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the sound\nthat had disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: the noise was like\nbranches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window:\ncreak, creak, creak. He wondered if there were willow-trees close to\nthe house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was\nnot in an ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listening\nto that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He sat up,\nand felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down again\nrelieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: \u2018Fear\nnothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!\u2019\nThen he went to sleep again.\nIt was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet\nsleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading\nirresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled\nunderthewalls,andwasrisingslowlybutsurely.\u2018Ishallbedrowned!\u2019"}
{"152": "on the corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where\nhe was and lay down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing:\n\u2018Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and\nthe wind off the hill-top.\u2019 A little breath of sweet air moved the\ncurtain. He breathed deep and fell asleep again.\nAs far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep\ncontent, if logs are contented.\nThey woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was\nmoving about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them\nstir he clapped his hands, and cried: \u2018Hey! Come merry dol! derry\ndol! My hearties!\u2019 He drew back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits\nsaw that these had covered the windows, at either end of the room,\none looking east and the other looking west.\nThey leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and\nfound himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had\nhalf expected to see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with\nhoof-prints. Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on\npoles; but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed\nup against the sunrise. It was a pale morning: in the East, behind\nlong clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay\nglimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but the\nlight was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on the beans began\nto glow against the wet green leaves.\nPippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of\nmist. The Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down\non to a sloping cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel\nwhere the mist was broken into many plumes and billows: the valley\nof the Withywindle. The stream ran down the hill on the left and\nvanished into the white shadows. Near at hand was a flower-garden\nand a clipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grass\npale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen.\n\u2018Good morning, merry friends!\u2019 cried Tom, opening the eastern\nwindow wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. \u2018Sun won\u2019t\nshow her face much today, I\u2019m thinking. I have been walking wide,\nleaping on the hill-tops, since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and\nweather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me. I wakened Goldberry\nsinging under window; but naught wakes hobbit-folk in the early\nmorning. In the night little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleep\nafter light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends!\nForget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties!\nIf you come soon you\u2019ll find breakfast on the table. If you come late"}
{"153": "the hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was\nbeginning to look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were\nthere. Tom could be heard about the house, clattering in the kitchen,\nand up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside. The\nroom looked westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window\nwas open. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above. Before\nthey had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken\nroof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down. Behind\nits deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.\nAs they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if\nit was flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Gold-\nberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, but it\nseemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as sweet as\nshowers on dry hills, that told the tale of a river from the spring in\nthe highlands to the Sea far below. The hobbits listened with delight;\nand Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather,\nbecause it delayed them from departing. The thought of going had\nbeen heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed\nnow that they would not go further that day.\nThe upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds\nrolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs.\nNothing could be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo\nstood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn\ninto a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley.\nTom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house, waving\nhis arms as if he was warding off the rain \u2013 and indeed when he\nsprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots.\nThese he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the\nlargest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.\n\u2018This is Goldberry\u2019s washing day,\u2019 he said, \u2018and her autumn-\ncleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk \u2013 let them rest while they are able!\nIt\u2019s a good day for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom\nwill start the talking.\u2019\nHe then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if\nspeaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a\nbright blue eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to\nsong, and he would get out of his chair and dance about. He told\nthem tales of bees and flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange\ncreatures of the Forest, about the evil things and good things, things\nfriendly and things unfriendly, cruel things and kind things, and\nsecrets hidden under brambles."}
{"154": "where all other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out\nof his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to\ncontent him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortable\nlore. Tom\u2019s words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts,\nwhich were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things\nthat go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burn-\ning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest without\nreason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods;\nand in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers\nof the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The\ncountless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and\nwith malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow:\nhis heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning,\nand a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the\nwoods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power\nout of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and\ninvisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly\nall the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.\nSuddenly Tom\u2019s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young\nstream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and\namong small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at\nlast up on to the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the\ngreen mounds, and the stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows\namong the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks. Green walls and white\nwalls rose. There were fortresses on the heights. Kings of little king-\ndoms fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the red\nmetal of their new and greedy swords. There was victory and defeat;\nand towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the\nsky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and\nmounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass\ngrew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the\nhills were empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away,\nand the bones were stirred in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked in\nthe hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains\nin the wind. Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth\nin the moonlight.\nThe hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the\nBarrow-wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been\nheard. But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even\nby a comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly re-\nmembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds:\nthehouseofTomBombadilnestledundertheveryshoulderofthose"}
{"155": "When they caught his words again they found that he had now\nwandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their\nwaking thought, into times when the world was wider, and the seas\nflowed straight to the western Shore; and still on and back Tom went\nsinging out into ancient starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake.\nThen suddenly he stopped, and they saw that he nodded as if he was\nfalling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it\nseemed as if, under the spell of his words, the wind had gone, and\nthe clouds had dried up, and the day had been withdrawn, and\ndarkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was filled\nwith the light of white stars.\nWhether the morning and evening of one day or of many days\nhad passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either hungry or\ntired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through the window\nand the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him. He spoke\nat last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence:\n\u2018Who are you, Master?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Eh, what?\u2019 said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom.\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know my name yet? That\u2019s the only answer. Tell me,\nwho are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and\nI am old. Eldest, that\u2019s what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom\nwas here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the first\nraindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People,\nand saw the little People arriving. He was here before the Kings and\nthe graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward,\nTom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark\nunder the stars when it was fearless \u2013 before the Dark Lord came\nfrom Outside.\u2019\nA shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced\nhastily through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood\nin the door behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its\nflame from the draught with her hand; and the light flowed through\nit, like sunlight through a white shell.\n\u2018The rain has ended,\u2019 she said; \u2018and new waters are running down-\nhill, under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!\u2019\n\u2018And let us have food and drink!\u2019 cried Tom. \u2018Long tales are thirsty.\nAnd long listening\u2019s hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!\u2019 With\nthat he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from\nthe chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then\nhe danced about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door\nand disappeared.\nQuickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom"}
{"156": "odd the caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave\na single dance, neither hindering the other, in and out of the room,\nand round about the table; and with great speed food and vessels and\nlights were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white and\nyellow. Tom bowed to his guests. \u2018Supper is ready,\u2019 said Goldberry;\nand now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a\nwhite girdle, and her shoes were like fishes\u2019 mail. But Tom was all\nin clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had green\nstockings.\nIt was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the\nspell of Tom\u2019s words may have missed one meal or many, but when\nthe food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had\neaten. They did not sing or even speak much for a while, and paid\nclose attention to business. But after a time their hearts and spirits\nrose high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter.\nAfter they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs\nthat began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and\nin the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than\nany they had known, and looking into them they saw the sky below\nthem and the stars like jewels in the depths. Then once more she\nwished them each good night and left them by the fireside. But Tom\nnow seemed wide awake and plied them with questions.\nHe appeared already to know much about them and all their\nfamilies, and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of\nthe Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits\nthemselves. It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret that\nhe owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot, whom he\nseemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had\nimagined. \u2018There\u2019s earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers;\nwisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,\u2019 said Tom. It was\nalso clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that\nin some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the\nflight of Frodo.\nIndeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his question-\ning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his\nown hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom\nwagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when\nhe heard of the Riders.\n\u2018Show me the precious Ring!\u2019 he said suddenly in the midst of the\nstory: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from\nhis pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom."}
{"157": "a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his\nbright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the\nRing round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight.\nFor a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then\nthey gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!\nTom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air \u2013 and\nit vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry \u2013 and Tom leaned forward\nand handed it back to him with a smile.\nFrodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who\nhas lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the\nsame and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to\nFrodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted\nhim to make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for\nseeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously\nimportant. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going\nagain, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their\nqueer ways \u2013 then he slipped the Ring on.\nMerry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and\nchecked an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his\nown ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and\nobviously could not see him. He got up and crept quietly away from\nthe fireside towards the outer door.\n\u2018Hey there!\u2019 cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing\nlook in his shining eyes. \u2018Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you\na-going? Old Tom Bombadil\u2019s not as blind as that yet. Take off your\ngolden ring! Your hand\u2019s more fair without it. Come back! Leave\nyour game and sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, and\nthink about the morning. Tom must teach the right road, and keep\nyour feet from wandering.\u2019\nFrodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he\ncame and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the\nSun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and\nsetting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to start early;\nfor weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be\nsure of for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than he\ncould change his jacket. \u2018I am no weather-master,\u2019 said he; \u2018nor is\naught that goes on two legs.\u2019\nBy his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his\nhouse, over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might\nhope in that way to strike the East Road in a day\u2019s journey, and avoid\nthe Barrows. He told them not to be afraid \u2013 but to mind their own\nbusiness."}
{"158": "with hearts that never falter!\u2019 He said this more than once; and he\nadvised them to pass barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced\nto stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they\nshould by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day.\nHo! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!\nBy water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,\nBy fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!\nCome, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!\nWhen they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them\neach on the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back\nto their bedroom."}
{"159": "Chapter 8\nFOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS\nThat night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of\nthem, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running\nin his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a\ngrey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass\nand silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country\nopened before him under a swift sunrise.\nThe vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like\na tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill\nand through the open window. Outside everything was green and\npale gold.\nAfter breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to\nsay farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morn-\ning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue.\nThe air came fresh from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were\nalmost frisky, sniffing and moving restlessly. Tom came out of the\nhouse and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding the\nhobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.\nThey rode off along a path that wound away from behind the\nhouse, and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill-brow\nunder which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their\nponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.\n\u2018Goldberry!\u2019 he cried. \u2018My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We\nhave never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!\u2019 He\nwas so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear\ncall came rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning\nto them: her hair was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone\nand shimmered. A light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed\nfrom under her feet as she danced.\nThey hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her.\nThey bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round;\nand they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the morning.\nIt was now as clear and far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when\nthey stood upon the knoll in the Forest, which could now be seen\nrising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West. In that\ndirection the land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under\nthe sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine. To"}

Eastward the Barrow-downs\nrose, ridge behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eye-\nsight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote\nwhite glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it spoke to\nthem, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.\nThey took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a\nfew stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed\nfainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs\ntowards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom,\nover the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains.\nGoldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts.\n\u2018Speed now, fair guests!\u2019 she said. \u2018And hold to your purpose! North\nwith the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make\nhaste while the Sun shines!\u2019 And to Frodo she said: \u2018Farewell, Elf-\nfriend, it was a merry meeting!\u2019\nBut Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted\nhis pony, and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle\nslope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil\u2019s house and the valley, and the\nForest were lost to view. The air grew warmer between the green\nwalls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and\nsweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached the bottom\nof the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender like\na sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still watching them,\nand her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked she\ngave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished\nbehind the hill.\nTheir way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the\ngreen feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and\nthen over the shoulders of further hills, and down their long limbs,\nand up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down\ninto new valleys. There was no tree nor any visible water: it was a\ncountry of grass and short springy turf, silent except for the whisper\nof the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strange\nbirds. As they journeyed the sun mounted, and grew hot. Each time\nthey climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less. When\nthey caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest\nseemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again\nfrom leaf and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of"}
{"161": "About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flat-\ntened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there\nwas no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode\nacross and looked northwards. Then their hearts rose; for it seemed\nplain that they had come further already than they had expected.\nCertainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive, but\nthere could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end. A\nlong valley lay below them winding away northwards, until it came\nto an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemed\nto be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line.\n\u2018That is a line of trees,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018and that must mark the Road.\nAll along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing.\nSome say they were planted in the old days.\u2019\n\u2018Splendid!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018If we make as good going this afternoon\nas we have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before\nthe Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place.\u2019 But\neven as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, and he saw that on\nthat side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and all\nthose hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some were\nstanding stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.\nThat view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight\nand went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood\na single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour\ncasting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a land-\nmark, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning. But they were\nnow hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless noon; so they set\ntheir backs against the east side of the stone. It was cool, as if the\nsun had had no power to warm it; but at that time this seemed\npleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as good a noon-\nmeal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came\nfrom \u2018down under Hill\u2019. Tom had provided them with plenty for the\ncomfort of the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.\nRiding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the\nscent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and\nlooking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough\nto explain what happened. However that may be: they woke suddenly\nand uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The\nstanding stone was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched\neastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming\nthrough the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they\nlay; north, south, and east, beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold"}
{"162": "The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western\nrim. They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as\nthey looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before\ntheir eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the\nEast behind. The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them,\nand as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof:\nthey were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing\nstone.\nThey felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not\nquite lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had\nhad of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which\ndirection it lay. In any case, they now had so great a dislike for that\nhollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was\nin their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers\nwould work.\nSoon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and\ndown the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As\nthey went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair\nhung lank and dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the\nbottom it was so chill that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods,\nwhich soon became bedewed with grey drops. Then, mounting their\nponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise and\nfall of the ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess,\nfor the gate-like opening at the far northward end of the long valley\nwhich they had seen in the morning. Once they were through the\ngap, they had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and they\nwere bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go\nbeyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the\nDowns there might be no fog.\nTheir going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and\nwandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading.\nSam was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry.\nThe valley seemed to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a\nhopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through\nthe mist; and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap\nin the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs. If they could pass\nthat, they would be free.\n\u2018Come on! Follow me!\u2019 he called back over his shoulder, and he\nhurried forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and\nalarm. The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly\nhe saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards"}
{"163": "valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning. He had\npassed between them almost before he was aware: and even as he\ndid so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and\nsnorted, and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was\nalone: the others had not followed him.\n\u2018Sam!\u2019 he called. \u2018Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don\u2019t you\nkeep up?\u2019\nThere was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the\nstones shouting wildly: \u2018Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!\u2019 The pony bolted\ninto the mist and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he\nthought he heard a cry: \u2018Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!\u2019 It was away eastward,\non his left as he stood under the great stones, staring and straining\ninto the gloom. He plunged off in the direction of the call, and found\nhimself going steeply uphill.\nAs he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and\nmore frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it\nseemed faint and far ahead and high above him. \u2018Frodo! Hoy!\u2019 came\nthe thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help,\nhelp! often repeated, ending with a last help! that trailed off into a\nlong wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all the speed\nhe could towards the cries; but the light was now gone, and clinging\nnight had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of\nany direction. He seemed all the time to be climbing up and up.\nOnly the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him\nwhen he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary,\nsweating and yet chilled. It was wholly dark.\n\u2018Where are you?\u2019 he cried out miserably.\nThere was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware\nthat it was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning\nto blow, an icy wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist\nwas flowing past him now in shreds and tatters. His breath was\nsmoking, and the darkness was less near and thick. He looked up\nand saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid\nthe strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind began to hiss over\nthe grass.\nHe imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made\ntowards it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and\nthrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him\nthat he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top,\nwhich he must have climbed from the north. Out of the east the\nbitingwindwasblowing.Tohisrightthereloomedagainstthewest-"}
{"164": "\u2018Here!\u2019 said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of\nthe ground. \u2018I am waiting for you!\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and\nhe fell on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound.\nTrembling he looked up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow\nagainst the stars. It leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes,\nvery cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some\nremote distance. Then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized\nhim. The icy touch froze his bones, and he remembered no more.\nWhen he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall\nnothing except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was\nimprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight\nhad taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful spells\nof the Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He dared\nnot move, but lay as he found himself: flat on his back upon a cold\nstone with his hands on his breast.\nBut though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the\nvery darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking\nabout Bilbo Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together\nin the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures.\nThere is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the\nheart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, waiting for some final and\ndesperate danger to make it grow. Frodo was neither very fat nor\nvery timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf )\nhad thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought he had\ncome to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought\nhardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring;\nhe no longer felt limp like a helpless prey.\nAs he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed\nall at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish\nlight was growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind\nof a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself,\nand from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or\nwall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him\nSam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces\nlooked deathly pale; and they were clad in white. About them lay\nmany treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold\nand unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about\ntheir waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by\ntheir sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks\nlay one long naked sword."}
{"165": "Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The\nvoice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in\nthe air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out\nof the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings of words\nwould now and again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words,\nheartless and miserable. The night was railing against the morning\nof which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth for\nwhich it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while\nthe song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived\nthat it had changed into an incantation:\nCold be hand and heart and bone,\nand cold be sleep under stone:\nnever more to wake on stony bed,\nnever, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.\nIn the black wind the stars shall die,\nand still on gold here let them lie,\ntill the dark lord lifts his hand\nover dead sea and withered land.\nHe heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising\nhimself on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that\nthey were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner.\nRound the corner a long arm was groping, walking on its fingers\ntowards Sam, who was lying nearest, and towards the hilt of the\nsword that lay upon him.\nAt first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by\nthe incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He\nwondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would\nmiss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of himself\nrunning free over the grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin,\nbut free and alive himself. Gandalf would admit that there had been\nnothing else he could do.\nBut the courage that had been awakened in him was now too\nstrong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping\nin his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did so\nthe arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he\nseized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stooped\nlow over the bodies of his companions. With what strength he had\nhe hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off;\nbut at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt. There\nwas a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a snarling"}
{"166": "once back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first\ncoming of the fog, came the memory of the house down under the\nHill, and of Tom singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had\ntaught them. In a small desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil!\nand with that name his voice seemed to grow strong: it had a full\nand lively sound, and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and\ntrumpet.\nHo! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!\nBy water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,\nBy fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!\nCome, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!\nThere was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his\nheart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away,\nas if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls,\nan answering voice singing:\nOld Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,\nBright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.\nNone has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:\nHis songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.\nThere was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling,\nand suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A\nlow door-like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond\nFrodo\u2019s feet; and there was Tom\u2019s head (hat, feather, and all) framed\nagainst the light of the sun rising red behind him.

As Frodo left\nthe barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wrig-\ngling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went\nback in again, and there was a sound of much thumping and stamp-\ning. When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of\ntreasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many beads and\nchains and jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow and\nlaid them all on top in the sunshine.\nThere he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair,\nand looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their\nbacks upon the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right\nhand he said in a clear and commanding voice:\nWake now my merry lads! Wake and hear me calling!\nWarm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;\nDark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.\nNight under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!\nTo Frodo\u2019s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms,\nrubbed their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about\nin amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life\non the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves in their thin\nwhite rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling with\ntrinkets.\n\u2018What in the name of wonder?\u2019 began Merry, feeling the golden\ncirclet that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow\ncame over his face, and he closed his eyes. \u2018Of course, I remember!\u2019\nhe said. \u2018The men of Carn Du\u02c6 m came on us at night, and we were\nworsted.

{"168": "\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled\nand half amused. \u2018Why not?\u2019\nBut Tom shook his head, saying: \u2018You\u2019ve found yourselves again,\nout of the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from\ndrowning. Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heat\nnow heart and limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass,\nwhile Tom goes a-hunting!\u2019\nHe sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down\nafter him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green\nhollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and crying:\nHey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?\nUp, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?\nSharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,\nWhite-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!\nSo he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until\nhe was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey\nnow! hoy now! came floating back down the wind, which had shifted\nround towards the south.\nThe air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for\na while on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the\nsun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from\nbitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that, after being long\nill and bedridden, wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly\nwell and the day is again full of promise.\nBy the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and\nhungry). He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and be-\nhind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five and one\nmore. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger,\nfatter (and older) than their own ponies. Merry, to whom the others\nbelonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but they\nanswered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of\ntheir lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the\nbrow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.\n\u2018Here are your ponies, now!\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019ve more sense (in\nsome ways) than you wandering hobbits have \u2013 more sense in their\nnoses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if\nthey run to save themselves, then they run the right way. You must\nforgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of\nBarrow-wights is not what they were made for. See, here they come"}
{"169": "from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged\nto put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought\nagainst the oncoming of winter.\n\u2018Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come\nfrom?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018He\u2019s mine,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018My four-legged friend; though I seldom\nride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When\nyour ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they\nsmelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he\u2019d\nlook for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away.\nBut now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom\u2019s going to ride. Hey! he\u2019s\ncoming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony.\nFor you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, when you\u2019re on\nyour own legs trying to trot beside them.\u2019\nThe hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many\ntimes; but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing\nthemselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe\nover the borders of his land. \u2018I\u2019ve got things to do,\u2019 he said: \u2018my\nmaking and my singing, my talking and my walking, and my watching\nof the country. Tom can\u2019t be always near to open doors and willow-\ncracks. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting.\u2019\nIt was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and\nten, and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had\nbeen lunch beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted\nnow off the remainder of Tom\u2019s provisions, meant for their supper,\nwith additions that Tom had brought with him. It was not a large\nmeal (considering hobbits and the circumstances), but they felt much\nbetter for it. While they were eating Tom went up to the mound,\nand looked through the treasures. Most of these he made into a pile\nthat glistered and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie there \u2018free\nto all finders, birds, beasts, Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures\u2019;\nfor so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and\nno Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a\nbrooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the\nwings of blue butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some\nmemory, shaking his head, and saying at last:\n\u2018Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who\nlong ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and\nwe will not forget her!\u2019\nFor each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and\nkeen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in"}
{"170": "fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of\nthe spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by\ntime, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.\n\u2018Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south,\nor far away into dark and danger.\u2019 Then he told them that these\nblades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they\nwere foes of the Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king\nof Carn Du\u02c6 m in the Land of Angmar.\n\u2018Few now remember them,\u2019 Tom murmured, \u2018yet still some go\nwandering, sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding\nfrom evil things folk that are heedless.\u2019\nThe hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they\nhad a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like\na vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and\ngrim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow.\nThen the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was\ntime to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and lading\ntheir ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts\nunder their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if\nthey would be of any use. Fighting had not before occurred to any\nof them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land\nthem.\nAt last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then\nmounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back\nand saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight\non the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder\nof the Downs and it was hidden from view.\nThough Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of\nthe great stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to\nthe northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away\nbefore them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting\ngaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could\nmove much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of the\ntime, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language\nunknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were\nmainly those of wonder and delight.\nThey went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was\nfurther away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep\nat mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it until after\nnightfall on the day before. The dark line they had seen was not a"}
{"171": "the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long time ago. He seemed to\nremember something sad about it, and would not say much.\nThey climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the\nwall, and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing\nsomewhat to the west. The land was now open and fairly level, and\nthey quickened their pace, but the sun was already sinking low when\nat last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that they\nhad come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures. They\ngalloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the\nlong shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a sloping bank,\nand the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away below\nthem. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and\non their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted\nand bore many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and\npot-holes full of water.\nThey rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was\nnothing to be seen. \u2018Well, here we are again at last!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I\nsuppose we haven\u2019t lost more than two days by my short cut through\nthe Forest! But perhaps the delay will prove useful \u2013 it may have put\nthem off our trail.\u2019\nThe others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black\nRiders came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered\nthe Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only\nnow when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger\nwhich pursued them, and was more than likely to be lying in wait\nfor them upon the Road itself. They looked anxiously back towards\nthe setting sun, but the Road was brown and empty.\n\u2018Do you think,\u2019 asked Pippin hesitatingly, \u2018do you think we may\nbe pursued, tonight?\u2019\n\u2018No, I hope not tonight,\u2019 answered Tom Bombadil; \u2018nor perhaps\nthe next day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain.\nOut east my knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the\nBlack Land far beyond his country.\u2019\nAll the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They\nfelt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone\ndid. They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange\nto them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of\nthe Shire, and in the gathering twilight they longed for home. A deep\nloneliness and sense of loss was on them. They stood silent, reluctant\nto make the final parting, and only slowly became aware that Tom\nwas wishing them farewell, and telling them to have good heart and\nto ride on till dark without halting."}
{"172": "the Road you\u2019ll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors\nlooking westward. There you\u2019ll find an old inn that is called The\nPrancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you\ncan stay the night, and afterwards the morning will speed you upon\nyour way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and ride\nto meet your fortune!\u2019\nThey begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once\nmore with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:\nTom\u2019s country ends here: he will not pass the borders.\nTom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!\nThen he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin\u2019s back, and\nrode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk.\nThe hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of\nsight.\n\u2018I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018He\u2019s a\ncaution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and\nsee naught better, nor queerer. But I won\u2019t deny I\u2019ll be glad to see\nthis Prancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it\u2019ll be like The Green Dragon\naway back home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?\u2019\n\u2018There are hobbits in Bree,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018as well as Big Folk. I\ndaresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by all\naccounts. My people ride out there now and again.\u2019\n\u2018It may be all we could wish,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but it is outside the\nShire all the same. Don\u2019t make yourselves too much at home! Please\nremember \u2013 all of you \u2013 that the name of Baggins must not be\nmentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.\u2019\nThey now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the\nevening. Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly down-\nhill and up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance\nahead.\nBefore them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against\nmisty stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village.\nTowards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door\nbetween them and the night."}
{"173": "Chapter 9\nAT THE SIGN OF THE\nPRANCING PONY\nBree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region,\nlike an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself,\nthere was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep\nvalley a little further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chet-\nwood. Lying round Bree-hill and the villages was a small country of\nfields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad.\nThe Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short,\ncheerful and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves;\nbut they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves,\nElves, and other inhabitants of the world about them than was (or\nis) usual with Big People. According to their own tales they were the\noriginal inhabitants and were the descendants of the first Men that\never wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few had survived\nthe turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned again\nover the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they\nwere still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded\ninto the grass.\nIn those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or\nwithin a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond\nBree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them\nRangers, and knew nothing of their origin. They were taller and\ndarker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powers\nof sight and hearing, and to understand the languages of beasts and\nbirds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far as\nthe Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. When\nthey appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten\ntales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make\nfriends of them.\nThere were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land; and\nthey claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one\nthat was founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and\nthe Shire colonized. They lived mostly in Staddle though there were\nsome in Bree itself, especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above\nthe houses of the Men. The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they"}
{"174": "parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere else in the world was this peculiar\n(but excellent) arrangement to be found.\nThe Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much;\nand the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern. Occasion-\nally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing;\nbut though their little land was not much further than a day\u2019s riding\neast of the Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom\nvisited it. An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would\ncome out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming\nless and less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and\nto any others that lived beyond the borders, as Outsiders, and took\nvery little interest in them, considering them dull and uncouth. There\nwere probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of\nthe World in those days than the people of the Shire imagined. Some,\ndoubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in any\nbank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the Bree-land,\nat any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more\nrustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgot-\nten that there had been a time when there was much coming and\ngoing between the Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the\nBrandybucks by all accounts.\nThe village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big\nFolk, mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windows\nlooking west. On that side, running in more than half a circle from\nthe hill and back to it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on\nthe inner side. Over this the Road crossed by a causeway; but where\nit pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate. There was another\ngate in the southern corner where the Road ran out of the village.\nThe gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside them were small\nlodges for the gatekeepers.\nDown on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the\nfoot of the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when\nthe traffic on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an\nold meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed the East Road just\noutside the dike at the western end of the village, and in former days\nMen and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it. Strange\nas News from Bree was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descending\nfrom those days, when news from North, South, and East could be\nheard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used to go more often\nto hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, and\nthe North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the"}
{"175": "an important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle,\ntalkative, and inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of\nthe four villages; and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and\nfor such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed on the East\nRoad, to and from the Mountains.\nIt was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his\ncompanions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near\nthe village. They came to the West-gate and found it shut; but at the\ndoor of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up\nand fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise.\n\u2018What do you want, and where do you come from?\u2019 he asked\ngruffly.\n\u2018We are making for the inn here,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018We are jour-\nneying east and cannot go further tonight.\u2019\n\u2018Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what\u2019s more, out of the Shire by their\ntalk,\u2019 said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared\nat them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and\nlet them ride through.\n\u2018We don\u2019t often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,\u2019 he\nwent on, as they halted a moment by his door. \u2018You\u2019ll pardon my\nwondering what business takes you away east of Bree! What may\nyour names be, might I ask?\u2019\n\u2018Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem\na good place to discuss them,\u2019 said Frodo, not liking the look of the\nman or the tone of his voice.\n\u2018Your business is your own, no doubt,\u2019 said the man; \u2018but it\u2019s my\nbusiness to ask questions after nightfall.\u2019\n\u2018We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and\nto stay at the inn here,\u2019 put in Merry. \u2018I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that\nenough for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers,\nor so I had heard.\u2019\n\u2018All right, all right!\u2019 said the man. \u2018I meant no offence. But you\u2019ll\nfind maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking\nyou questions. There\u2019s queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony,\nyou\u2019ll find you\u2019re not the only guests.\u2019\nHe wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo\ncould see in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them\ncuriously. He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they\nrode forward. He wondered why the man was so suspicious, and\nwhether anyone had been asking for news of a party of hobbits.

{"176": "The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went\nback to his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure\nclimbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the\nvillage street.\nThe hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached\nhouses, and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and\nstrange to them. Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and\nmany windows, and felt his heart sink. He had imagined himself\nmeeting giants taller than trees, and other creatures even more terrify-\ning, some time or other in the course of his journey; but at the\nmoment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses\nquite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day. He\npictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the\ninn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.\n\u2018We surely aren\u2019t going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?\u2019 he\nexclaimed. \u2018If there are hobbit-folk in these parts, why don\u2019t we look\nfor some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more\nhomelike.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s wrong with the inn?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Tom Bombadil recom-\nmended it. I expect it\u2019s homelike enough inside.\u2019\nEven from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar\neyes. It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on\nland partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear\nthe second-floor windows were level with the ground. There was a\nwide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings, and on the\nleft under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad\nsteps. The door was open and light streamed out of it. Above the\narch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a large signboard: a fat\nwhite pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door was painted in\nwhite letters: the prancing pony by barliman butterbur. Many\nof the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.\nAs they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a\nmerry song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the\nchorus. They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and\nthen got off their ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of\nlaughter and clapping.\nThey led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing\nin the yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went forward and nearly\nbumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face. He\nhad a white apron on, and was bustling out of one door and in\nthrough another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs."}
{"177": "and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a\nmoment he was out again, wiping his hands on his apron.\n\u2018Good evening, little master!\u2019 he said, bending down. \u2018What may\nyou be wanting?\u2019\n\u2018Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed.\nAre you Mr. Butterbur?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your\nservice! You\u2019re from the Shire, eh?\u2019 he said, and then suddenly he\nclapped his hand to his forehead, as if trying to remember something.\n\u2018Hobbits!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Now what does that remind me of ?

I\u2019m run off\nmy feet; but I\u2019ll see what I can do for you. We don\u2019t often get a party\nout of the Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you\nwelcome. But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as\nthere hasn\u2019t been for long enough. It never rains but it pours, we say\nin Bree.\u2019\n\u2018Hi! Nob!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Where are you, you woolly-footed slow-\ncoach? Nob!\u2019\n\u2018Coming, sir! Coming!\u2019 A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a\ndoor, and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with\ngreat interest.\n\u2018Where\u2019s Bob?\u2019 asked the landlord. \u2018You don\u2019t know? Well, find\nhim! Double sharp! I haven\u2019t got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell\nBob there\u2019s five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room\nsomehow.\u2019 Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink.\n\u2018Well now, what was I going to say?\u2019 said Mr. Butterbur, tapping\nhis forehead. \u2018One thing drives out another, so to speak. I\u2019m that\nbusy tonight, my head is going round. There\u2019s a party that came up\nthe Greenway from down South last night \u2013 and that was strange\nenough to begin with. Then there\u2019s a travelling company of dwarves\ngoing West come in this evening. And now there\u2019s you. If you weren\u2019t\nhobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we\u2019ve got a room or two\nin the north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place\nwas built. On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows\nand all as they like it.

{"178": "you want anything, ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he\ndon\u2019t come, ring and shout!\u2019\nOff he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He\nseemed capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might\nbe. They found themselves in a small and cosy room. There was a\nbit of bright fire burning on the hearth, and in front of it were some\nlow and comfortable chairs. There was a round table, already spread\nwith a white cloth, and on it was a large hand-bell. But Nob, the\nhobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought of ringing.\nHe brought candles and a tray full of plates.\n\u2018Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?\u2019 he asked. \u2018And\nshall I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?\u2019\nThey were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer\nwhen Mr. Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the table\nwas laid. There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves,\nslabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as\nthe Shire could show, and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam\u2019s\nmisgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the beer).\nThe landlord hovered round for a little, and then prepared to leave\nthem. \u2018I don\u2019t know whether you would care to join the company,\nwhen you have supped,\u2019 he said, standing at the door. \u2018Perhaps you\nwould rather go to your beds. Still the company would be very pleased\nto welcome you, if you had a mind. We don\u2019t get Outsiders \u2013 travellers\nfrom the Shire, I should say, begging your pardon \u2013 often; and we\nlike to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in mind.\nBut as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack anything!\u2019\nSo refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their\nsupper (about three quarters of an hour\u2019s steady going, not hindered\nby unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join\nthe company. Merry said it would be too stuffy. \u2018I shall sit here\nquietly by the fire for a bit, and perhaps go out later for a sniff of\nthe air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don\u2019t forget that you are supposed\nto be escaping in secret, and are still on the high-road and not very\nfar from the Shire!\u2019\n\u2018All right!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Mind yourself ! Don\u2019t get lost, and don\u2019t\nforget that it is safer indoors!\u2019\nThe company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gather-\ning was large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got\nused to the light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the\nthree lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and half veiled in\nsmoke. Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire, talking to a"}
{"179": "(sitting chattering together), a few more dwarves, and other vague\nfigures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners.\nAs soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of wel-\ncome from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had\ncome up the Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord intro-\nduced the newcomers to the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they\ncaught many names, they were seldom sure who the names belonged\nto. The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical (and to the\nShire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes,\nAppledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention Butterbur). Some\nof the hobbits had similar names. The Mugworts, for instance,\nseemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as\nBanks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of\nwhich were used in the Shire. There were several Underhills from\nStaddle, and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being\nrelated, they took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin.\nThe Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo\nsoon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have\nto be given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geogra-\nphy (at which there was much wagging of heads, although neither of\nthese words were much used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was\nthinking of writing a book (at which there was silent astonishment),\nand that he and his friends wanted to collect information about\nhobbits living outside the Shire, especially in the eastern lands.\nAt this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted\nto write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned\nenough for several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not\nenough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning with \u2018Old\nBarliman here\u2019, to whom he could go for further information. But\nafter a time, as Frodo did not show any sign of writing a book on\nthe spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the\nShire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon found\nhimself sitting alone in a corner, listening and looking around.\nThe Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and\ntelling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There\nwas trouble away in the South, and it seemed that the Men who had\ncome up the Greenway were on the move, looking for lands where\nthey could find some peace. The Bree-folk were sympathetic, but\nplainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their\nlittle land. One of the travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow,\nwas foretelling that more and more people would be coming north\nin the near future. \u2018If room isn\u2019t found for them, they\u2019ll find it for"}
{"180": "The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, as it did not\nat the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg\nfor lodgings in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and\nPippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily\nabout events in the Shire. Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with\nan account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in Michel\nDelving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in the\nWestfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out like a floured\ndumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodo\na little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been\nin the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived\nand who they were related to.\nSuddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten\nman, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently\nto the hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was\nsmoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were\nstretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather that\nfitted him well, but had seen much wear and were now caked with\nmud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn\nclose about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood\nthat overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen\nas he watched the hobbits.\n\u2018Who is that?\u2019 Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to\nMr. Butterbur. \u2018I don\u2019t think you introduced him?\u2019\n\u2018Him?\u2019 said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye\nwithout turning his head. \u2018I don\u2019t rightly know. He is one of the\nwandering folk \u2013 Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but\nwhat he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind. He disappears for\na month, or a year, and then he pops up again. He was in and out\npretty often last spring; but I haven\u2019t seen him about lately. What\nhis right name is I\u2019ve never heard: but he\u2019s known round here as\nStrider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though he\ndon\u2019t tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there\u2019s no account-\ning for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and\nthe Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about\nhim.\u2019 But at that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand\nfor more ale and his last remark remained unexplained.\nFrodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had\nheard or guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his\nhand and a nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As\nFrodo drew near he threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of\ndark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen"}
{"181": "to meet you, Master \u2013 Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name\nright.\u2019\n\u2018He did,\u2019 said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under\nthe stare of those keen eyes.\n\u2018Well, Master Underhill,\u2019 said Strider, \u2018if I were you, I should\nstop your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, and\nchance-meeting are pleasant enough, but, well \u2013 this isn\u2019t the Shire.\nThere are queer folk about. Though I say it as shouldn\u2019t, you may\nthink,\u2019 he added with a wry smile, seeing Frodo\u2019s glance. \u2018And there\nhave been even stranger travellers through Bree lately,\u2019 he went on,\nwatching Frodo\u2019s face.\nFrodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no\nfurther sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin.\nTo his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took,\nencouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was\nnow actually giving a comic account of Bilbo\u2019s farewell party. He\nwas already giving an imitation of the Speech, and was drawing near\nto the astonishing Disappearance.\nFrodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the\nlocal hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people\naway beyond the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew\na thing or two, and had probably heard rumours long ago about\nBilbo\u2019s vanishing. It would bring the name of Baggins to their minds,\nespecially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name.\nFrodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much\nenjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful\nof their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood\nhe might even mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.\n\u2018You had better do something quick!\u2019 whispered Strider in his ear.\nFrodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The\nattention of Pippin\u2019s audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits\nlooked at Frodo and laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr.\nUnderhill had taken as much ale as was good for him.\nFrodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his\nhabit when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He\nfelt the Ring on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came\nover him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed\nto him, somehow, as if the suggestion came to him from outside,\nfrom someone or something in the room. He resisted the temptation\nfirmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it\nand prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At any rate it\ngave him no inspiration. He spoke \u2018a few suitable words\u2019, as they"}

A song!\u2019 shouted all the others. \u2018Come\non now, master, sing us something that we haven\u2019t heard before!\u2019\nFor a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began\na ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed\nrather proud of, for he had made up the words himself ). It was about\nan inn; and that is probably why it came into Frodo\u2019s mind just\nthen. Here it is in full. Only a few words of it are now, as a rule,\nremembered.\nThere is an inn, a merry old inn\nbeneath an old grey hill,\nAnd there they brew a beer so brown\nThat the Man in the Moon himself came down\none night to drink his fill.\nThe ostler has a tipsy cat\nthat plays a five-stringed fiddle;\nAnd up and down he runs his bow,\nNow squeaking high, now purring low,\nnow sawing in the middle.\nThe landlord keeps a little dog\nthat is mighty fond of jokes;\nWhen there\u2019s good cheer among the guests,\nHe cocks an ear at all the jests\nand laughs until he chokes.\nThey also keep a horne\u00b4d cow\nas proud as any queen;\nBut music turns her head like ale,\nAnd makes her wave her tufted tail\nand dance upon the green.\nAnd O! the rows of silver dishes\nand the store of silver spoons!\nFor Sunday* there\u2019s a special pair,\nAnd these they polish up with care\non Saturday afternoons."}
{"183": "The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,\nand the cat began to wail;\nA dish and a spoon on the table danced,\nThe cow in the garden madly pranced,\nand the little dog chased his tail.\nThe Man in the Moon took another mug,\nand then rolled beneath his chair;\nAnd there he dozed and dreamed of ale,\nTill in the sky the stars were pale,\nand dawn was in the air.\nThen the ostler said to his tipsy cat:\n\u2018The white horses of the Moon,\nThey neigh and champ their silver bits;\nBut their master\u2019s been and drowned his wits,\nand the Sun\u2019ll be rising soon!\u2019\nSo the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,\na jig that would wake the dead:\nHe squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,\nWhile the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:\n\u2018It\u2019s after three!\u2019 he said.\nThey rolled the Man slowly up the hill\nand bundled him into the Moon,\nWhile his horses galloped up in rear,\nAnd the cow came capering like a deer,\nand a dish ran up with the spoon.\nNow quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;\nthe dog began to roar,\nThe cow and the horses stood on their heads;\nThe guests all bounded from their beds\nand danced upon the floor.\nWith a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!\nthe cow jumped over the Moon,\nAnd the little dog laughed to see such fun,\nAnd the Saturday dish went off at a run\nwith the silver Sunday spoon."}
{"184": "The round Moon rolled behind the hill\nas the Sun raised up her head.\nShe* hardly believed her fiery eyes;\nFor though it was day, to her surprise\nthey all went back to bed!\nThere was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and\nthe song tickled their fancy. \u2018Where\u2019s old Barley?\u2019 they cried. \u2018He\nought to hear this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then\nwe\u2019d have a dance.\u2019 They called for more ale, and began to shout:\n\u2018Let\u2019s have it again, master! Come on now! Once more!\u2019\nThey made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song\nagain, while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known,\nand they were quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo\u2019s turn\nto feel pleased with himself. He capered about on the table; and\nwhen he came a second time to the cow jumped over the Moon, he\nleaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, into\na tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off the table with a crash,\nclatter, and bump! The audience all opened their mouths wide for\nlaughter, and stopped short in gaping silence; for the singer dis-\nappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the\nfloor without leaving a hole!\nThe local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their\nfeet and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from\nPippin and Sam, who found themselves left alone in a corner, and\neyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that many\npeople regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician\nof unknown powers and purpose. But there was one swarthy Bree-\nlander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and half-mocking\nexpression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he\nslipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the\ntwo had been whispering together a good deal during the evening.\nFrodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away\nunder the tables to the dark corner by Strider, who sat unmoved,\ngiving no sign of his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall\nand took off the Ring. How it came to be on his finger he could not\ntell. He could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket\nwhile he sang, and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck\nout his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a moment he wondered\nif the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it had tried to\nreveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in\nthe room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out."}
{"185": "\u2018Well?\u2019 said Strider, when he reappeared. \u2018Why did you do that?\nWorse than anything your friends could have said! You have put your\nfoot in it! Or should I say your finger?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u2019 said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.\n\u2018Oh yes, you do,\u2019 answered Strider; \u2018but we had better wait until\nthe uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should\nlike a quiet word with you.\u2019\n\u2018What about?\u2019 asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper\nname.\n\u2018A matter of some importance \u2013 to us both,\u2019 answered Strider,\nlooking Frodo in the eye. \u2018You may hear something to your\nadvantage.\u2019\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. \u2018I\u2019ll talk to\nyou later.\u2019\nMeanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace.

He just vanished into thin air, in\na manner of speaking.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t say, Mr. Mugwort!\u2019 said the landlord, looking puzzled.\n\u2018Yes I do!\u2019 replied Mugwort. \u2018And I mean what I say, what\u2019s more.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s some mistake somewhere,\u2019 said Butterbur, shaking his\nhead. \u2018There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing\ninto thin air; or into thick air, as is more likely in this room.\u2019\n\u2018Well, where is he now?\u2019 cried several voices.\n\u2018How should I know? He\u2019s welcome to go where he will, so long\nas he pays in the morning. There\u2019s Mr. Took, now: he\u2019s not vanished.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Mugwort\nobstinately.\n\u2018And I say there\u2019s some mistake,\u2019 repeated Butterbur, picking up\nthe tray and gathering up the broken crockery.\n\u2018Of course there\u2019s a mistake!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I haven\u2019t vanished. Here\nI am! I\u2019ve just been having a few words with Strider in the corner.\u2019\nHe came forward into the firelight; but most of the company\nbacked away, even more perturbed than before. They were not in\nthe least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly\nunder the tables after he had fallen.

{"187": "Chapter 10\nSTRIDER\nFrodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There\nwas no light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It\nwas not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown\non a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come with\nthem. There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!\n\u2018Hallo!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Who are you, and what do you want?\u2019\n\u2018I am called Strider,\u2019 he answered; \u2018and though he may have for-\ngotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.\u2019\n\u2018You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,\u2019 said\nFrodo. \u2018What have you to say?\u2019\n\u2018Several things,\u2019 answered Strider. \u2018But, of course, I have my price.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 asked Frodo sharply.\n\u2018Don\u2019t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know,\nand give you some good advice \u2013 but I shall want a reward.\u2019\n\u2018And what will that be, pray?\u2019 said Frodo. He suspected now that\nhe had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he\nhad brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardly\nsatisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.\n\u2018No more than you can afford,\u2019 answered Strider with a slow smile,\nas if he guessed Frodo\u2019s thoughts. \u2018Just this: you must take me along\nwith you, until I wish to leave you.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, indeed!\u2019 replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved.\n\u2018Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such\nthing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business.\u2019\n\u2018Excellent!\u2019 exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back\ncomfortably. \u2018You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that\nis all to the good.

Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as\nfor Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for\namusement.\u2019\n\u2018What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with\nhim?\u2019 said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider\u2019s\nhints.\n\u2018News of you, of course,\u2019 answered Strider. \u2018An account of your\nperformance would be very interesting to certain people. After that\nthey would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me\nonly too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is\nthat enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a\nguide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands between the\nShire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for\nmany years. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You will\nhave to leave the open road after tonight; for the horsemen will watch\nit night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go\nforward while the Sun is up; but you won\u2019t go far. They will come\non you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do\nyou wish them to find you? They are terrible!\u2019\nThe hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face\nwas drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his\nchair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to\nhave grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking\nin distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.\n\u2018There!\u2019 he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his\nbrow. \u2018Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You\nfear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will\nhave to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by paths that are\nseldom trodden. Will you have him?\u2019\nThere was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer; his mind was\nconfused with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master;\nand at last he broke out:\n\u2018With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I\u2019d say no! This Strider here, he\nwarns and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let\u2019s begin"}
{"190": "but it\u2019s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some\ndark place far from help, as he puts it.\u2019\nPippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply\nto Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance\nand looked away. \u2018No,\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018I don\u2019t agree. I think, I think\nyou are not really as you choose to look. You began to talk to me\nlike the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right\nin this: I don\u2019t see why you should warn us to take care, and yet ask\nus to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do\nyou really know about \u2013 about my business; and how do you know\nit?\u2019\n\u2018The lesson in caution has been well learned,\u2019 said Strider with a\ngrim smile. \u2018But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You\nwill never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is\nyour only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer\nsome of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But why\nshould you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still\nhere it is\u2014\u2014\u2019\nAt that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur\nhad arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot\nwater. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.\n\u2018I\u2019ve come to bid you good night,\u2019 said the landlord, putting the\ncandles on the table. \u2018Nob! Take the water to the rooms!\u2019 He came\nin and shut the door.\n\u2018It\u2019s like this,\u2019 he began, hesitating and looking troubled. \u2018If I\u2019ve\ndone any harm, I\u2019m sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another,\nas you\u2019ll admit; and I\u2019m a busy man. But first one thing and then\nanother this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and\nnot too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits of\nthe Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular.\u2019\n\u2018And what has that got to do with me?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018Ah! you know best,\u2019 said the landlord, knowingly. \u2018I won\u2019t give\nyou away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the\nname of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well\nenough, if I may say so.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed! Let\u2019s have it then!\u2019 said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.\n\u2018A stout little fellow with red cheeks,\u2019 said Mr. Butterbur solemnly.\nPippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. \u2018That won\u2019t help you\nmuch; it goes for most hobbits, Barley, he says to me,\u2019 continued Mr.\nButterbur with a glance at Pippin. \u2018But this one is taller than some and\nfairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright"}

Still what\u2019s done can\u2019t be undone.\u2019\n\u2018Well, what have you done?\u2019 said Frodo, getting impatient with\nthe slow unravelling of Butterbur\u2019s thoughts.\n\u2018Where was I?\u2019 said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers.\n\u2018Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my\nroom without a knock. Barley, he says, I\u2019m off in the morning. Will\nyou do something for me? You\u2019ve only to name it, I said. I\u2019m in a hurry,\nsaid he, and I\u2019ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire.\nHave you anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I\nsaid, tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and\nthen he gave me a letter.\n\u2018It\u2019s addressed plain enough,\u2019 said Mr. Butterbur, producing a\nletter from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly\n(he valued his reputation as a lettered man):\nMr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.\n\u2018A letter for me from Gandalf !\u2019 cried Frodo.\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Mr. Butterbur. \u2018Then your right name is Baggins?\u2019\n\u2018It is,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018and you had better give me that letter at once,\nand explain why you never sent it. That\u2019s what you came to tell\nme, I suppose, though you\u2019ve taken a long time to come to the\npoint.\u2019\nPoor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. \u2018You\u2019re right, master,\u2019 he\nsaid, \u2018and I beg your pardon. And I\u2019m mortal afraid of what Gandalf\nwill say, if harm comes of it. But I didn\u2019t keep it back a-purpose. I\nput it by safe. Then I couldn\u2019t find nobody willing to go to the Shire\nnext day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were to spare;\nand then one thing after another drove it out of my mind. I\u2019m a busy\nman. I\u2019ll do what I can to set matters right, and if there\u2019s any help\nI can give, you\u2019ve only to name it.\n\u2018Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he\nsays to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this\nway before long, him and another. He\u2019ll be calling himself Underhill. Mind\nthat! But you need ask no questions. And if I\u2019m not with him, he may be\nin trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I\u2019ll\nbe grateful, he says.

They cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go\nhome. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them\nand keep the black men off ?\u2019\n\u2018Me? Leave Bree!

But if you mean to help me, I ought\nto warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house.\nThese Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come\nfrom\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\u2018They come from Mordor,\u2019 said Strider in a low voice. \u2018From\nMordor, Barliman, if that means anything to you.\u2019\n\u2018Save us!\u2019 cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently\nwas known to him. \u2018That is the worst news that has come to Bree in\nmy time.\u2019\n\u2018It is,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Are you still willing to help me?\u2019\n\u2018I am,\u2019 said Mr. Butterbur. \u2018More than ever.

It\u2019s a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to\nhimself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo\u2019s\ngoing off has been heard before tonight in Bree.

I had an ugly dream, which I can\u2019t remember. I went to pieces.\nI don\u2019t know what came over me.\u2019\n\u2018I do,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018The Black Breath. The Riders must have left"}
{"198": "Ferny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Something\nmay happen in the night, before we leave Bree.\u2019\n\u2018What will happen?\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Will they attack the inn?\u2019\n\u2018No, I think not,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018They are not all here yet. And in\nany case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strong-\nest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and\nmany people \u2013 not until they are desperate, not while all the long\nleagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and\nalready some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches\nto some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe,\nthe gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at West-gate on\nMonday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when they\nleft him.\u2019\n\u2018We seem to have enemies all round,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018What are we\nto do?\u2019\n\u2018Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have\nfound out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking\nnorth and close to the ground. We will all remain together and bar\nthis window and the door. But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.\u2019\nWhile Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of\nall that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and\npondering Gandalf \u2019s letter when Strider and Nob returned.\n\u2018Well Masters,\u2019 said Nob, \u2018I\u2019ve ruffled up the clothes and put in\na bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation\nof your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag \u2013 Underhill, sir,\u2019\nhe added with a grin.\nPippin laughed. \u2018Very life-like!\u2019 he said. \u2018But what will happen\nwhen they have penetrated the disguise?\u2019\n\u2018We shall see,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018Let us hope to hold the fort till\nmorning.\u2019\n\u2018Good night to you,\u2019 said Nob, and went off to take his part in\nthe watch on the doors.\nTheir bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed\na low chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo\nsaw that the night was still clear. The Sickle* was swinging bright\nabove the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy\ninside shutters and drew the curtains together. Strider built up the\nfire and blew out all the candles.\nThe hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the\nhearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They\ntalked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.\n\u2018Jumped over the Moon!\u2019 chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in"}

{"200": "Chapter 11\nA KNIFE IN THE DARK\nAs they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on Buck-\nland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river-bank. The house\nat Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously\nand peered out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day,\nand he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat\nin the breathless night-air. As he stared out into the gloom, a black\nshadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own\naccord and close again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank\nback, and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall. Then he shut\nand locked the door.\nThe night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led\nwith stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three\nblack figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground.\nOne went to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side;\nand there they stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night\nwent slowly on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting\nbreathlessly.\nThere was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away.\nThe cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door\nmoved. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed,\nas if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but\nheavy, and the door shuddered.\n\u2018Open, in the name of Mordor!\u2019 said a voice thin and menacing.\nAt a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers\nburst and lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.\nAt that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent\nthe night like fire on a hill-top.\nawake! fear! fire! foes! awake!\nFatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes\ncreep from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish.\nAnd run he did, out of the back door, through the garden, and over\nthe fields. When he reached the nearest house, more than a mile\naway, he collapsed on the doorstep. \u2018No, no, no!\u2019 he was crying. \u2018No,\nnotme!Ihaven\u2019tgotit!\u2019Itwassometimebeforeanyonecouldmake"}

And\nthen they lost no more time.\nfear! fire! foes!\nThe Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that\nhad not been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves\ncame in the Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over.\nawake! awake!\nFar away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading.\nThe black figures fled from the house. One of them let fall a\nhobbit-cloak on the step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs\nbroke out, and gathering to a gallop, went hammering away into the\ndarkness. All about Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blow-\ning, and voices crying and feet running. But the Black Riders rode\nlike a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow! Sauron would\ndeal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew\nnow that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode\ndown the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.\nIn the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if\nsome sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was\nsitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire,\nwhich had been tended and was burning brightly; but he made no\nsign or movement.\nFrodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled\nwith the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to\nbe curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a\nhorn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing\nlustily in the inn-yard. Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed\nback the shutters with a clang. The first grey light of day was in the\nroom, and a cold air was coming through the open window.\nAs soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their\nbedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken\nhis advice: the windows had been forced open and were swinging,\nand the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the\nbolsters slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat was torn\nto pieces.\nStrider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr.\nButterbur looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his"}
{"202": "\u2018Never has such a thing happened in my time!\u2019 he cried, raising\nhis hands in horror. \u2018Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good\nbolsters ruined and all! What are we coming to?\u2019\n\u2018Dark times,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018But for the present you may be left in\npeace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never\nmind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do.\nWe shall be packed in a few minutes.\u2019\nMr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready,\nand to fetch them a \u2018bite\u2019. But very soon he came back in dismay.\nThe ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in\nthe night, and they were gone: not only Merry\u2019s ponies, but every\nother horse and beast in the place.\nFrodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach\nRivendell on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well\nset out for the Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the\nhobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength and courage.\n\u2018Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,\u2019 he said at last,\nthoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. \u2018We should\nnot go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I\nwas going to walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble\nme. We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and\nRivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to take plenty\nto spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far\nout of the direct way. How much are you prepared to carry on your\nbacks?\u2019\n\u2018As much as we must,\u2019 said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying\nto show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt).\n\u2018I can carry enough for two,\u2019 said Sam defiantly.\n\u2018Can\u2019t anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018Can\u2019t we\nget a couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage?\nI don\u2019t suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy\nthem,\u2019 he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it.\n\u2018I doubt it,\u2019 said the landlord unhappily. \u2018The two or three riding-\nponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they\u2019re\ngone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not,\nthere are very few of them in Bree, and they won\u2019t be for sale. But\nI\u2019ll do what I can. I\u2019ll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as\nmay be.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Strider reluctantly, \u2018you had better do that. I am afraid\nwe shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope of\nstarting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown\na horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no"}
{"203": "crumb, I hope: we can have breakfast while we wait \u2013 and sit down\nto it. Let\u2019s get hold of Nob!\u2019\nIn the end there was more than three hours\u2019 delay. Bob came back\nwith the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money\nin the neighbourhood \u2013 except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might\npossibly sell. \u2018A poor old half-starved creature it is,\u2019 said Bob; \u2018but\nhe won\u2019t part with it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you\u2019re\nplaced, not if I knows Bill Ferny.\u2019\n\u2018Bill Ferny?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Isn\u2019t there some trick? Wouldn\u2019t the\nbeast bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or\nsomething?\u2019\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018But I cannot imagine any animal running\nhome to him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought\nof kind Master Ferny\u2019s: just a way of increasing his profits from the\naffair. The chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death\u2019s\ndoor. But there does not seem any choice. What does he want for\nit?\u2019\nBill Ferny\u2019s price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed\nat least three times the pony\u2019s value in those parts. It proved to be\na bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying\njust yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another\neighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals. He was\nan honest man, and well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but\nthirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by\nBill Ferny made it harder to bear.\nAs a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It\nturned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The\nothers had been driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found\nwandering in different corners of the Bree-land. Merry\u2019s ponies had\nescaped altogether, and eventually (having a good deal of sense) they\nmade their way to the Downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin. So they\ncame under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while, and were well-off.\nBut when news of the events at Bree came to Tom\u2019s ears, he sent\nthem to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very fair\nprice. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well;\nso on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous\njourney. But they never came to Rivendell.\nHowever, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money\nwas gone for good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For there\nwas a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir\nand heard news of the raid on the inn. The southern travellers had"}
{"204": "night, none other than Bill Ferny\u2019s squint-eyed companion. Suspicion\nfell on him at once.\n\u2018If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,\u2019\nsaid Butterbur angrily, \u2018you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves\nand not come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your hand-\nsome friend is!\u2019 But it appeared that he was nobody\u2019s friend, and\nnobody could recollect when he had joined their party.\nAfter their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together\nfurther supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. It\nwas close on ten o\u2019clock before they at last got off. By that time the\nwhole of Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo\u2019s vanishing trick;\nthe appearance of the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and\nnot least the news that Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious\nhobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years.\nMost of the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle, and many even from\nCombe and Archet, were crowded in the road to see the travellers\nstart. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out\nof the windows.\nStrider had changed his mind, and had decided to leave Bree by\nthe main road. Any attempt to set off across country at once would\nonly make matters worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to\nsee what they were up to, and to prevent them from trespassing.\nThey said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr.\nButterbur with many thanks. \u2018I hope we shall meet again some day,\nwhen things are merry once more,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I should like nothing\nbetter than to stay in your house in peace for a while.\u2019\nThey tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of\nthe crowd. Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that\nwere shouted. But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the\nBree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew\naway. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin;\nand last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as much\nof their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked\nless dejected, as if it approved of the change in its fortunes. Sam was\nchewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of them: a parting\npresent from Nob and Bob. \u2018Apples for walking, and a pipe for\nsitting,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I reckon I\u2019ll miss them both before long.\u2019\nThe hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped\nout of doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed. But\nas they drew near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house\nbehind a thick hedge: the last house in the village. In one of the"}
{"205": "\u2018So that\u2019s where that southerner is hiding!\u2019 he thought. \u2018He looks\nmore than half like a goblin.\u2019\nOver the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy\nblack brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a\nsneer. He was smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he\ntook it out of his mouth and spat.\n\u2018Morning, Longshanks!\u2019 he said. \u2018Off early? Found some friends\nat last?\u2019 Strider nodded, but did not answer.\n\u2018Morning, my little friends!\u2019 he said to the others. \u2018I suppose you\nknow who you\u2019ve taken up with? That\u2019s Stick-at-naught Strider, that\nis! Though I\u2019ve heard other names not so pretty. Watch out tonight!\nAnd you, Sammie, don\u2019t go ill-treating my poor old pony! Pah!\u2019 He\nspat again.\nSam turned quickly. \u2018And you, Ferny,\u2019 he said, \u2018put your ugly face\nout of sight, or it will get hurt.\u2019 With a sudden flick, quick as lightning,\nan apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked\ntoo late, and curses came from behind the hedge. \u2018Waste of a good\napple,\u2019 said Sam regretfully, and strode on.\nAt last they left the village behind. The escort of children and\nstragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the\nSouth-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some\nmiles. It bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it\nrounded the feet of Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly down-\nwards into wooded country. To their left they could see some of the\nhouses and hobbit-holes of Staddle on the gentler south-eastern\nslopes of the hill; down in a deep hollow away north of the Road\nthere were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe lay;\nArchet was hidden in the trees beyond.\nAfter the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill\nstanding tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that\nled off towards the North. \u2018This is where we leave the open and take\nto cover,\u2019 said Strider.\n\u2018Not a \u2018\u2018short cut\u2019\u2019, I hope,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Our last short cut through\nwoods nearly ended in disaster.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, but you had not got me with you then,\u2019 laughed Strider. \u2018My\ncuts, short or long, don\u2019t go wrong.\u2019 He took a look up and down\nthe Road. No one was in sight; and he led the way quickly down\ntowards the wooded valley.\nHis plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the\ncountry, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass\nit on the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild"}
{"206": "to avoid the Midgewater Marshes. But, of course, they would have\nto pass through the marshes themselves, and Strider\u2019s description of\nthem was not encouraging.\nHowever, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed,\nif it had not been for the disturbing events of the night before, they\nwould have enjoyed this part of the journey better than any up to\nthat time. The sun was shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in\nthe valley were still leafy and full of colour, and seemed peaceful\nand wholesome. Strider guided them confidently among the many\ncrossing paths, although left to themselves they would soon have\nbeen at a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many turns\nand doublings, to put off any pursuit.\n\u2018Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,\u2019\nhe said; \u2018though I don\u2019t think he will follow us himself. He knows\nthe land round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match\nfor me in a wood. It is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I\ndon\u2019t suppose they are far away. If they think we have made for\nArchet, so much the better.\u2019\nWhether because of Strider\u2019s skill or for some other reason, they saw\nno sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day:\nneither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and\na few squirrels. The next day they began to steer a steady course\neastwards; and still all was quiet and peaceful. On the third day out\nfrom Bree they came out of the Chetwood. The land had been falling\nsteadily, ever since they turned aside from the Road, and they now\nentered a wide flat expanse of country, much more difficult to man-\nage. They were far beyond the borders of the Bree-land, out in the\npathless wilderness, and drawing near to the Midgewater Marshes.\nThe ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and\nthere they came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes\nfilled with the warbling of little hidden birds. They had to pick their\nway carefully to keep both dry-footed and on their proper course. At\nfirst they made fair progress, but as they went on, their passage\nbecame slower and more dangerous. The marshes were bewildering\nand treacherous, and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers\nto find through their shifting quagmires. The flies began to torment\nthem, and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their\nsleeves and breeches and into their hair.\n\u2018I am being eaten alive!\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018Midgewater! There are\nmore midges than water!\u2019\n\u2018What do they live on when they can\u2019t get hobbit?\u2019 asked Sam,"}
{"207": "Their camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the\nbiting insects would not let them sleep. There were also abominable\ncreatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of\nthem were evil relatives of the cricket. There were thousands of them,\nand they squeaked all round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all\nthe night, until the hobbits were nearly frantic.\nThe next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost\nas comfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them)\nhad been left behind, the midges still pursued them.\nAs Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him\nthat far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and\nfaded many times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours\noff.\n\u2018What is the light?\u2019 he said to Strider, who had risen, and was\nstanding, gazing ahead into the night.\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 Strider answered. \u2018It is too distant to make out.\nIt is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.\u2019\nFrodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the\nwhite flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of Strider, standing\nsilent and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep.\nThey had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last\nstraggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them. The land\nbefore them began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance east-\nward they could now see a line of hills. The highest of them was at\nthe right of the line and a little separated from the others. It had a\nconical top, slightly flattened at the summit.\n\u2018That is Weathertop,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018The Old Road, which we have\nleft far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far\nfrom its foot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight\ntowards it. I suppose we had better do so.\u2019\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find.\nIt is close to the Road.\u2019\n\u2018But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?\u2019\n\u2018Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not\npass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are doing. And\nanyway, unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one\nanother; it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the\nRiders fail to find us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for\nWeathertop themselves. It commands a wide view all round. Indeed,\nthere are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as"}
{"208": "The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up\ninto the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them\nwith bright unfriendly eyes. \u2018You do make me feel uncomfortable\nand lonesome, Strider!\u2019 he said.\n\u2018What do you advise us to do?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018I think,\u2019 answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, \u2018I\nthink the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can,\nto make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike\na path I know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop\nfrom the north and less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.\u2019\nAll that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening\ncame down. The land became drier and more barren; but mists and\nvapours lay behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy birds\nwere piping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly into the\nwestern shadows; then an empty silence fell. The hobbits thought of\nthe soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of Bag\nEnd far away.\nAt the day\u2019s end they came to a stream that wandered down from\nthe hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up\nalong its banks while the light lasted. It was already night when at\nlast they halted and made their camp under some stunted alder-trees\nby the shores of the stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky\nsky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills. That night they set a watch,\nand Strider, it seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and\nin the early night-hours a cold grey light lay on the land.\nNext morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a\nfrost in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt\nrefreshed, as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they\nwere getting used to much walking on short commons \u2013 shorter at\nany rate than what in the Shire they would have thought barely\nenough to keep them on their legs. Pippin declared that Frodo was\nlooking twice the hobbit that he had been.\n\u2018Very odd,\u2019 said Frodo, tightening his belt, \u2018considering that there\nis actually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning process will\nnot go on indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.\u2019\n\u2018Do not speak of such things!\u2019 said Strider quickly, and with sur-\nprising earnestness.\nThe hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising\nalmost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low\nclefts orpasses leading into theeastern land beyond.Along the crest"}

It was the night of the\nfifth of October, and they were six days out from Bree.\nIn the morning they found, for the first time since they had left\nthe Chetwood, a track plain to see. They turned right and followed\nit southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so\nas to keep as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the\nhill-tops above and of the flats to the west. It dived into dells, and\nhugged steep banks; and where it passed over flatter and more open\nground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and\nhewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge.\n\u2018I wonder who made this path, and what for,\u2019 said Merry, as they\nwalked along one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually\nlarge and closely set. \u2018I am not sure that I like it: it has a \u2013 well,\nrather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?\u2019\n\u2018No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,\u2019\nanswered Strider. \u2018The Men of the West did not live here; though\nin their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil\nthat came out of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along\nthe walls. But long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they\nbuilt a great watch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Su\u02c6l they called it. It\nwas burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled\nring, like a rough crown on the old hill\u2019s head. Yet once it was tall and\nfair. It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-\ngalad out of the West, in the days of the Last Alliance.\u2019\nThe hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old\nlore, as well as in the ways of the wild. \u2018Who was Gil-galad?\u2019 asked\nMerry; but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought.\nSuddenly a low voice murmured:\nGil-galad was an Elven-king.\nOf him the harpers sadly sing:\nthe last whose realm was fair and free\nbetween the Mountains and the Sea.\nHis sword was long, his lance was keen,\nhis shining helm afar was seen;\nthe countless stars of heaven\u2019s field\nwere mirrored in his silver shield.\nBut long ago he rode away,\nand where he dwelleth none can say;"}
{"210": "The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam\u2019s.\n\u2018Don\u2019t stop!\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018That\u2019s all I know,\u2019 stammered Sam, blushing. \u2018I learned it from\nMr. Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like that, knowing\nhow I was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as\ntaught me my letters. He was mighty book-learned was dear old\nMr. Bilbo. And he wrote poetry. He wrote what I have just said.\u2019\n\u2018He did not make it up,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018It is part of the lay that is\ncalled The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must\nhave translated it. I never knew that.\u2019\n\u2018There was a lot more,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018all about Mordor. I didn\u2019t learn\nthat part, it gave me the shivers. I never thought I should be going\nthat way myself !\u2019\n\u2018Going to Mordor!\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018I hope it won\u2019t come to that!\u2019\n\u2018Do not speak that name so loudly!\u2019 said Strider.\nIt was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of\nthe path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October\nsun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward\nslope of the hill. They decided to make for the top at once, while the\ndaylight was broad. Concealment was no longer possible, and they\ncould only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them. Nothing\nwas to be seen moving on the hill. If Gandalf was anywhere about,\nthere was no sign of him.\nOn the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow,\nat the bottom of which there was a bowl-shaped dell with grassy\nsides. There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs\nand luggage. The other three went on. After half an hour\u2019s plodding\nclimb Strider reached the crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry fol-\nlowed, tired and breathless. The last slope had been steep and rocky.\nOn the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient\nstone-work, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in\nthe centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled. They were black-\nened as if with fire. About them the turf was burned to the roots and\nall within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames\nhad swept the hill-top; but there was no sign of any living thing.\nStanding upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round\nbelow them a wide prospect, for the most part of lands empty and\nfeatureless, except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond\nwhich they caught here and there the glint of distant water. Beneath\nthem on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road,\ncoming out of the West and winding up and down, until it faded"}
{"211": "the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; behind them stood taller\nshapes of grey, and behind those again were high white peaks glim-\nmering among the clouds.\n\u2018Well, here we are!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018And very cheerless and uninviting\nit looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf.\nBut I don\u2019t blame him for not waiting \u2013 if he ever came here.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. \u2018Even if he\nwas a day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first.\nHe can ride very swiftly when need presses.\u2019 Suddenly he stooped\nand looked at the stone on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than\nthe others, and whiter, as if it had escaped the fire. He picked it up\nand examined it, turning it in his fingers. \u2018This has been handled\nrecently,\u2019 he said. \u2018What do you think of these marks?\u2019\nOn the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches: . \u2018There\nseems to be a stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,\u2019\nsaid Strider. \u2018It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot\nbe sure. The scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the\nmarks might mean something quite different, and have nothing to\ndo with us. Rangers use runes, and they come here sometimes.\u2019\n\u2018What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018I should say,\u2019 answered Strider, \u2018that they stood for G3, and were\na sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days\nago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was\nat hand, so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything\nlonger or plainer. If that is so, we must be wary.\u2019\n\u2018I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they\nmay mean,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It would be a great comfort to know that\nhe was on the way, in front of us or behind us.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018For myself, I believe that he was here,\nand was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now\nthe light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back\nto my mind. I guess that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with\nwhat result I cannot tell. He is here no longer, and we must now\nlook after ourselves and make our own way to Rivendell, as best we\ncan.\u2019\n\u2018How far is Rivendell?\u2019 asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The\nworld looked wild and wide from Weathertop.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond\nthe Forsaken Inn, a day\u2019s journey east of Bree,\u2019 answered Strider.\n\u2018Some say it is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road,\nand folk are glad to reach their journey\u2019s end, whether the time is"}
{"212": "the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses the Loudwater that\nruns out of Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight\u2019s journey before\nus, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.\u2019\n\u2018A fortnight!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018A lot may happen in that time.\u2019\n\u2018It may,\u2019 said Strider.\nThey stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward\nedge. In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his\nhomelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left\nhim in the quiet and beloved Shire. He stared down at the hateful\nRoad, leading back westward \u2013 to his home. Suddenly he was aware\nthat two black specks were moving slowly along it, going westward;\nand looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward\nto meet them. He gave a cry and clutched Strider\u2019s arm.\n\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, pointing downwards.\nAt once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined\ncircle, pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself along-\nside.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 he whispered.\n\u2018I do not know, but I fear the worst,\u2019 answered Strider.\nSlowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered\nthrough a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was no longer\nbright, for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of\nthe East had now overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They\ncould all see the black specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could\nmake out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there,\nfar below, were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the\nfoot of the hill.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. \u2018The\nenemy is here!\u2019\nHastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the\nhill to find their companions.\nSam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small\ndell and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring\nof clear water in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a\nday or two old. In the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire,\nand other signs of a hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on\nthe edge of the dell nearest to the hill. Behind them Sam came upon\na small store of firewood neatly stacked.\n\u2018I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,\u2019 he said to Pippin. \u2018Who-\never it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.\u2019\nStrider was greatly interested in these discoveries. \u2018I wish I had"}
{"213": "\u2018It is just as I feared,\u2019 he said, when he came back. \u2018Sam and\nPippin have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or\nconfused. Rangers have been here lately. It is they who left the fire-\nwood behind. But there are also several newer tracks that were not\nmade by Rangers. At least one set was made, only a day or two ago,\nby heavy boots. At least one. I cannot now be certain, but I think there\nwere many booted feet.\u2019 He paused and stood in anxious thought.\nEach of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and\nbooted Riders. If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner\nStrider led them somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the hollow\nwith great dislike, now that he had heard news of their enemies on\nthe Road, only a few miles away.\n\u2018Hadn\u2019t we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?\u2019 he asked im-\npatiently. \u2018It is getting late, and I don\u2019t like this hole: it makes my\nheart sink somehow.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,\u2019 answered\nStrider, looking up and considering the time and the weather. \u2018Well,\nSam,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018I do not like this place either; but I cannot\nthink of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall. At least\nwe are out of sight for the moment, and if we moved we should be\nmuch more likely to be seen by spies. All we could do would be to\ngo right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills,\nwhere the land is all much the same as it is here. The Road is watched,\nbut we should have to cross it, if we tried to take cover in the thickets\naway to the south. On the north side of the Road beyond the hills\nthe country is bare and flat for miles.\u2019\n\u2018Can the Riders see?\u2019 asked Merry. \u2018I mean, they seem usually to\nhave used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling\nis the right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down\nflat when you saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen,\nif we move.\u2019\n\u2018I was too careless on the hill-top,\u2019 answered Strider. \u2018I was very\nanxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three\nof us to go up and stand there so long. For the black horses can see,\nand the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found\nat Bree. They themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but\nour shapes cast shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun\ndestroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that\nare hidden from us: then they are most to be feared. And at all times\nthey smell the blood of living things, desiring and hating it. Senses,\ntoo, there are other than sight or smell. We can feel their presence\n\u2013ittroubledourhearts,assoonaswecamehere,andbeforewesaw"}
{"214": "\u2018Is there no escape then?\u2019 said Frodo, looking round wildly. \u2018If I\nmove I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to\nme!\u2019\nStrider laid his hand on his shoulder. \u2018There is still hope,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the\nfire as a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall\nserve for both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all\nthings, but these Riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it.\nFire is our friend in the wilderness.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 muttered Sam. \u2018It is also as good a way of saying \u2018\u2018here\nwe are\u2019\u2019 as I can think of, bar shouting.\u2019\nDown in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit\na fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began to fall, and\nit grew cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had\nnot eaten anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more\nthan a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty of all save birds\nand beasts, unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world.\nRangers passed at times beyond the hills, but they were few and did\nnot stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of evil sort: trolls might\nstray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Moun-\ntains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often\ndwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help\nand few words to spare for strangers.\n\u2018I don\u2019t see how our food can be made to last,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018We\nhave been careful enough in the last few days, and this supper is no\nfeast; but we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks\nstill to go, and perhaps more.\u2019\n\u2018There is food in the wild,\u2019 said Strider; \u2018berry, root, and herb;\nand I have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid of\nstarving before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long\nand weary work, and we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think\nwith hope of the tables of Elrond\u2019s house!\u2019\nThe cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the\nedge of the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing\nquickly into shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly\nfilled with twinkling stars. Frodo and his companions huddled round\nthe fire, wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed; but\nStrider was content with a single cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing\nthoughtfully at his pipe.\nAs night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly\nhe began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear. He knew"}
{"215": "good and evil deeds of the Elder Days. They wondered how old he\nwas, and where he had learned all this lore.\n\u2018Tell us of Gil-galad,\u2019 said Merry suddenly, when he paused at\nthe end of a story of the Elf-kingdoms. \u2018Do you know any more of\nthat old lay that you spoke of ?\u2019\n\u2018I do indeed,\u2019 answered Strider. \u2018So also does Frodo, for it con-\ncerns us closely.\u2019 Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring\ninto the fire.\n\u2018I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,\u2019 said Frodo slowly.\n\u2018Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth.\nGil-galad is Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he\nwent to the land of\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Strider interrupting, \u2018I do not think that tale should be\ntold now with the servants of the Enemy at hand. If we win through\nto the house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.\u2019\n\u2018Then tell us some other tale of the old days,\u2019 begged Sam; \u2018a tale\nabout the Elves before the fading time. I would dearly like to hear\nmore about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.\u2019\n\u2018I will tell you the tale of Tinu\u00b4viel,\u2019 said Strider, \u2018in brief \u2013 for it\nis a long tale of which the end is not known; and there are none now,\nexcept Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It is a\nfair tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet\nit may lift up your hearts.\u2019 He was silent for some time, and then he\nbegan not to speak but to chant softly:\nThe leaves were long, the grass was green,\nThe hemlock-umbels tall and fair,\nAnd in the glade a light was seen\nOf stars in shadow shimmering.\nTinu\u00b4viel was dancing there\nTo music of a pipe unseen,\nAnd light of stars was in her hair,\nAnd in her raiment glimmering.\nThere Beren came from mountains cold,\nAnd lost he wandered under leaves,\nAnd where the Elven-river rolled\nHe walked alone and sorrowing.\nHe peered between the hemlock-leaves\nAnd saw in wonder flowers of gold\nUpon her mantle and her sleeves,\nAnd her hair like shadow following."}
{"216": "Enchantment healed his weary feet\nThat over hills were doomed to roam;\nAnd forth he hastened, strong and fleet,\nAnd grasped at moonbeams glistening.\nThrough woven woods in Elvenhome\nShe lightly fled on dancing feet,\nAnd left him lonely still to roam\nIn the silent forest listening.\nHe heard there oft the flying sound\nOf feet as light as linden-leaves,\nOr music welling underground,\nIn hidden hollows quavering.\nNow withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,\nAnd one by one with sighing sound\nWhispering fell the beechen leaves\nIn the wintry woodland wavering.\nHe sought her ever, wandering far\nWhere leaves of years were thickly strewn,\nBy light of moon and ray of star\nIn frosty heavens shivering.\nHer mantle glinted in the moon,\nAs on a hill-top high and far\nShe danced, and at her feet was strewn\nA mist of silver quivering.\nWhen winter passed, she came again,\nAnd her song released the sudden spring,\nLike rising lark, and falling rain,\nAnd melting water bubbling.\nHe saw the elven-flowers spring\nAbout her feet, and healed again\nHe longed by her to dance and sing\nUpon the grass untroubling.\nAgain she fled, but swift he came.\nTinu\u00b4viel! Tinu\u00b4viel!\nHe called her by her Elvish name;\nAnd there she halted listening.\nOne moment stood she, and a spell\nHis voice laid on her: Beren came,"}
{"217": "As Beren looked into her eyes\nWithin the shadows of her hair,\nThe trembling starlight of the skies\nHe saw there mirrored shimmering.\nTinu\u00b4viel the elven-fair,\nImmortal maiden elven-wise,\nAbout him cast her shadowy hair\nAnd arms like silver glimmering.\nLong was the way that fate them bore,\nO\u2019er stony mountains cold and grey,\nThrough halls of iron and darkling door,\nAnd woods of nightshade morrowless.\nThe Sundering Seas between them lay,\nAnd yet at last they met once more,\nAnd long ago they passed away\nIn the forest singing sorrowless.\nStrider sighed and paused before he spoke again. \u2018That is a song,\u2019\nhe said, \u2018in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the Elves,\nbut is hard to render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough\necho of it. It tells of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and Lu\u00b4thien\nTinu\u00b4viel. Beren was a mortal man, but Lu\u00b4thien was the daughter of\nThingol, a King of Elves upon Middle-earth when the world was\nyoung; and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all\nthe children of this world. As the stars above the mists of the Northern\nlands was her loveliness, and in her face was a shining light. In those\ndays the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a servant,\ndwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West coming\nback to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils\nwhich he had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But\nthe Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping\nthrough great peril came over the Mountains of Terror into the\nhidden Kingdom of Thingol in the forest of Neldoreth. There he\nbeheld Lu\u00b4thien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted\nriver Esgalduin; and he named her Tinu\u00b4viel, that is Nightingale in\nthe language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and they\nwere parted long. Tinu\u00b4viel rescued Beren from the dungeons of\nSauron, and together they passed through great dangers, and cast\ndown even the Great Enemy from his throne, and took from his iron\ncrown one of the three Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the\nbride-price of Lu\u00b4thien to Thingol her father. Yet at the last Beren"}
{"218": "from the world, so that she might follow him; and it is sung that they\nmet again beyond the Sundering Seas, and after a brief time walking\nalive once more in the green woods, together they passed, long ago,\nbeyond the confines of this world. So it is that Lu\u00b4thien Tinu\u00b4viel alone\nof the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have\nlost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the\nElf-lords of old descended among Men. There live still those of whom\nLu\u00b4thien was the foremother, and it is said that her line shall never\nfail. Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin. For of Beren and Lu\u00b4thien\nwas born Dior Thingol\u2019s heir; and of him Elwing the White whom\nEa\u00a8rendil wedded, he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world\ninto the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon his brow. And of\nEa\u00a8rendil came the Kings of Nu\u00b4menor, that is Westernesse.\u2019\nAs Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly\nlit in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice\nwas rich and deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a\npale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind him. The\nwaxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed\nthem, and the stars above the hill-top faded.\nThe story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. \u2018Look!\u2019 said\nMerry. \u2018The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.\u2019\nThe others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top\nof the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moon-\nrise. It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by\nthe pale light.\nSam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and\nPippin remained seated in silence. Strider was watching the moon-\nlight on the hill intently. All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a\ncold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider was no longer\nspeaking. He huddled closer to the fire. At that moment Sam came\nrunning back from the edge of the dell.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what it is,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I suddenly felt afraid. I\ndurstn\u2019t go outside this dell for any money; I felt that something was\ncreeping up the slope.\u2019\n\u2018Did you see anything?\u2019 asked Frodo, springing to his feet.\n\u2018No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn\u2019t stop to look.\u2019\n\u2018I saw something,\u2019 said Merry; \u2018or I thought I did \u2013 away westwards\nwhere the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of\nthe hill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They\nseemed to be moving this way.\u2019\n\u2018Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!\u2019 cried Strider.\n\u2018Get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!\u2019"}
{"219": "encircled them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or move-\nment in the night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break the\nsilence: he longed to shout out aloud.\n\u2018Hush!\u2019 whispered Strider. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 gasped Pippin at the\nsame moment.\nOver the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they\nfelt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one.\nThey strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon\nthere could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing\nthere on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that\nthey seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo\nthought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a\nthin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.\nTerror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves\nflat on the ground. Sam shrank to Frodo\u2019s side. Frodo was hardly\nless terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter\ncold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put\non the Ring. The desire to do this laid hold of him, and he could\nthink of nothing else. He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message\nof Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard\nall warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with the hope of escape,\nor of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt that he must\ntake the Ring and put it on his finger. He could not speak. He felt\nSam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great\ntrouble, but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and\nstruggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last\nhe slowly drew out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger\nof his left hand.\nImmediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and\ndark, the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath\ntheir black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on\nthe lip of the dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen\nand merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon\ntheir grey hairs were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were\nswords of steel. Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed\ntowards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword, and it seemed to\nhim that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. Two of the figures\nhalted. The third was taller than the others: his hair was long and\ngleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a long\nsword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that\nheld it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down\non Frodo."}
{"220": "time he struck at the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the\nnight; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left\nshoulder. Even as he swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist,\na glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming\nbrand of wood in either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his\nsword, slipped the Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight\nupon it."}
{"221": "Chapter 12\nFLIGHT TO THE FORD\nWhen Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desper-\nately. He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning\nbrightly. His three companions were bending over him.\n\u2018What has happened? Where is the pale king?\u2019 he asked wildly.\nThey were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while;\nnor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from\nSam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming\ntowards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had\nvanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and\nhe fell. He heard Frodo\u2019s voice, but it seemed to come from a great\ndistance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words. They\nsaw nothing more, until they stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying\nas if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him.\nStrider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire, and\nthen he disappeared. That was now a good while ago.\nSam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider;\nbut while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of\nthe shadows. They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over\nFrodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.\n\u2018I am not a Black Rider, Sam,\u2019 he said gently, \u2018nor in league with\nthem. I have been trying to discover something of their movements;\nbut I have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do\nnot attack again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere\nat hand.\u2019\nWhen he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern,\nand shook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry\nto heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, and to\nbathe the wound with it. \u2018Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo\nwarm!\u2019 he said. Then he got up and walked away, and called Sam\nto him. \u2018I think I understand things better now,\u2019 he said in a low\nvoice. \u2018There seem only to have been five of the enemy. Why they\nwere not all here, I don\u2019t know; but I don\u2019t think they expected to\nbe resisted. They have drawn off for the time being. But not far, I\nfear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They\nare only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost\naccomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear,"}
{"222": "Sam choked with tears. \u2018Don\u2019t despair!\u2019 said Strider. \u2018You must\ntrust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed,\nthough Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and I\nthink he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his\nenemies expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him\nwell, while I am away!\u2019 He hurried off and disappeared again into\nthe darkness.\nFrodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and\na deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side.\nHis friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound.\nThe night passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky,\nand the dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black\ncloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the\nlower hem there was a slash. \u2018This was the stroke of Frodo\u2019s sword,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is\nunharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More\ndeadly to him was the name of Elbereth.\u2019\n\u2018And more deadly to Frodo was this!\u2019 He stooped again and lifted\nup a long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised\nit they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was\nbroken off. But even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in\nastonishment, for the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke\nin the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider\u2019s hand. \u2018Alas!\u2019 he cried. \u2018It\nwas this accursed knife that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in\nhealing to match such evil weapons. But I will do what I can.\u2019\nHe sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on\nhis knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then\nsetting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words\nthe others could not catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out\nthe long leaves of a plant.\n\u2018These leaves,\u2019 he said, \u2018I have walked far to find; for this plant\ndoes not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the\nRoad I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.\u2019 He crushed a\nleaf in his fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. \u2018It\nis fortunate that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men\nof the West brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they named it, and it\ngrows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped\nof old; and it is not known in the North, except to some of those\nwho wander in the Wild. It has great virtues, but over such a wound\nas this its healing powers may be small.\u2019"}
{"223": "unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some\npower over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of\nfrozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm,\nand he could not raise or use his hand. He bitterly regretted his\nfoolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now\nperceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire\nbut the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he would\nremain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue\ntheir journey. He felt too weak to stand.\nThe others were discussing this very question. They quickly\ndecided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible. \u2018I think now,\u2019 said\nStrider, \u2018that the enemy has been watching this place for some days.\nIf Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride\naway, and he will not return. In any case we are in great peril here\nafter dark, since the attack of last night, and we can hardly meet\ngreater danger wherever we go.\u2019\nAs soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and\npacked. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the\ngreater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo\non the pony. In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonder-\nfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show\nan affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill Ferny\u2019s\ntreatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to\nseem so much better than its former life.\nThey started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing\nthe Road, but it was the quickest way to more wooded country. And\nthey needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm,\nespecially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all.\nIt was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another\ngreat loop of the Road: east beyond Weathertop it changed its course\nand took a wide bend northwards.\nThey made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-\nwestern slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of\nthe Road. There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were\nhurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling\nand a cold voice answering. Trembling they sprang forward, and\nmade for the thickets that lay ahead. The land before them sloped\naway southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted\ntrees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between. The\ngrass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the thickets were\nfadedand falling.Itwas acheerlessland,and theirjourneywas slow"}
{"224": "down, and their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider\nseemed tired and heavy-hearted.\nBefore the first day\u2019s march was over Frodo\u2019s pain began to grow\nagain, but he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days passed,\nwithout the ground or the scene changing much, except that behind\nthem Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the distant mountains\nloomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard\nno sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them.\nThey dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night,\nexpecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night,\ndimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and heard\nno sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did\nthey feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the\nattack in the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had\nalready lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some\nambush in a narrow place?\nAt the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise\nslowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended.\nStrider now turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the\nsixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and\nsaw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills. Away below them they could\nsee the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right\na grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they\nglimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist.\n\u2018I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,\u2019 said\nStrider. \u2018We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves\ncall Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells\nnorth of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater away in the South. Some\ncall it the Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the\nSea. There is no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors,\nexcept by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses.\u2019\n\u2018What is that other river we can see far away there?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,\u2019 answered Strider.\n\u2018The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the\nBridge to the Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we\nshall cross that water. One river at a time! We shall be fortunate\nindeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us.\u2019\nNext day, early in the morning, they came down again to the\nborders of the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found\nno sign of any travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills\nthere had been some rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days"}
{"225": "They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after\na mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a\nshort steep slope. They dreaded to see black figures waiting there,\nbut they saw none. Strider made them take cover in a thicket at the\nside of the Road, while he went forward to explore.\nBefore long he came hurrying back. \u2018I can see no sign of the\nenemy,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I wonder very much what that means. But I\nhave found something very strange.\u2019\nHe held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. \u2018I\nfound it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is a\nberyl, an elf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I\ncannot say; but it brings hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we\nmay pass the Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road,\nwithout some clearer token.\u2019\nAt once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety,\nhearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches.\nA mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away north-\nwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider\nturned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark\ntrees winding among the feet of sullen hills.\nThe hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous\nRoad behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and\nunfriendly. As they went forward the hills about them steadily rose.\nHere and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of\nancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous\nlook. Frodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to\nthink. He recalled Bilbo\u2019s account of his journey and the threatening\ntowers on the hills north of the Road, in the country near the Trolls\u2019\nwood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo guessed\nthat they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance\nthey would pass near the spot.\n\u2018Who lives in this land?\u2019 he asked. \u2018And who built these towers?\nIs this troll-country?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Strider. \u2018Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land.\nMen once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. They became\nan evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of\nAngmar. But all were destroyed in the war that brought the North\nKingdom to its end. But that is now so long ago that the hills have\nforgotten them, though a shadow still lies on the land.\u2019\n\u2018Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forget-\nful?\u2019 asked Peregrin. \u2018The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that"}
{"226": "\u2018and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.\u2019\n\u2018Have you often been to Rivendell?\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018I have,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018I dwelt there once, and still I return when\nI may. There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even\nin the fair house of Elrond.\u2019\nThe hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on\nits way to the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view.\nThe travellers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark\nand silent. Trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and\npiled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-wood.\nThe hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had\nto pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen\ntrees and tumbled rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing\nfor Frodo\u2019s sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way\nup out of the narrow dales. They had been two days in this country\nwhen the weather turned wet. The wind began to blow steadily out\nof the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads\nof the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall they were all soaked,\nand their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire to burn.\nThe next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them, and\nthey were forced to turn away northwards out of their course. Strider\nseemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from\nWeathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low.\nIt went on raining.\nThat night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind\nthem, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff.\nFrodo was restless. The cold and wet had made his wound more\npainful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away\nall sleep. He lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the\nstealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock, water dripping, a crack,\nthe sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes\nwere advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing\nbut the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, and\nwatching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, in\nwhich he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed\nfaint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking\nover the hedge.\nIn the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The\nclouds were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue\nappeared between them. The wind was shifting again. They did not"}
{"227": "of the cliff, until he came back. He was going to climb up, if he\ncould, and get a look at the lie of the land.\nWhen he returned he was not reassuring. \u2018We have come too far\nto the north,\u2019 he said, \u2018and we must find some way to turn back\nsouthwards again. If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into\nthe Ettendales far north of Rivendell. That is troll-country, and little\nknown to me. We could perhaps find our way through and come\nround to Rivendell from the north; but it would take too long, for I\ndo not know the way, and our food would not last. So somehow or\nother we must find the Ford of Bruinen.\u2019\nThe rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground.\nThey found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley\nrunning south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but\ntowards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a\nridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many\nbare points like teeth of a blunted saw. They had a choice between\ngoing back or climbing over it.\nThey decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult.\nBefore long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on\nfoot. Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed\nof finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were. The light\nwas nearly gone, and they were all exhausted, when at last they\nreached the top. They had climbed on to a narrow saddle between\ntwo higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short\ndistance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground\nshivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt as\nif icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him\nseemed shadowy and dim.\n\u2018We cannot go any further,\u2019 said Merry to Strider. \u2018I am afraid\nthis has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious about\nhim. What are we to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him\nin Rivendell, if we ever get there?\u2019\n\u2018We shall see,\u2019 answered Strider. \u2018There is nothing more that I\ncan do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that\nI am so anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further\ntonight.\u2019\n\u2018What is the matter with my master?\u2019 asked Sam in a low voice,\nlooking appealingly at Strider. \u2018His wound was small, and it is already\nclosed. There\u2019s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his\nshoulder.\u2019\n\u2018Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,\u2019 said\nStrider, \u2018and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my"}
{"228": "Night was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down\nunder the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit:\nit looked as if stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled\ntogether. The wind blew chill through the pass, and they heard the\ntree-tops lower down moaning and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream,\nimagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and\nthat on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows\nof the hills.\nThe morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the\nlight pale and clear in a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were encour-\naged, but they longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As\nsoon as it was light, Strider took Merry with him and went to survey\nthe country from the height to the east of the pass. The sun had risen\nand was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting\nnews. They were now going more or less in the right direction. If\nthey went on, down the further side of the ridge, they would have\nthe Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught a\nglimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was\nhidden from view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River\nand lay on the side nearest to them.\n\u2018We must make for the Road again,\u2019 he said. \u2018We cannot hope to\nfind a path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the\nRoad is our only way to the Ford.\u2019\nAs soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly\ndown the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier\nthan they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side,\nand before long Frodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny\u2019s poor old\npony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path,\nand for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The spirits of the\nparty rose again. Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but\nevery now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he\npassed his hands over his eyes.\nPippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round\nand called to them. \u2018There is a path here!\u2019 he cried.\nWhen they came up with him, they saw that he had made no\nmistake: there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed\nwith many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the\nhill-top behind. In places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked\nwith fallen stones and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been\nmuch used. It was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet. Here\nand there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large rocks"}
{"229": "easiest way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety\nincreased as they came into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer\nand broader. Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply\ndown a slope, and turned sharply to the left round the corner of a\nrocky shoulder of the hill. When they came to the corner they looked\nround and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face\nof a low cliff overhung with trees. In the stony wall there was a door\nhanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.\nOutside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber\nbehind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam,\nand Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door\na little wider, and then Strider and Merry went in. They did not go\nfar, for on the floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be\nseen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots.\n\u2018Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know who made\nthe path \u2013 and we had better get off it quick.\u2019\n\u2018There is no need, I think,\u2019 said Strider, coming out. \u2018It is certainly\na troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. I don\u2019t think\nwe need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.\u2019\nThe path went on again from the door, and turning to the right\nagain across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope.\nPippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on\nahead with Merry. Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side\nof Frodo\u2019s pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five\nhobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone very far before\nPippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both looked\nterrified.\n\u2018There are trolls!\u2019 Pippin panted. \u2018Down in a clearing in the woods\nnot far below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They\nare very large!\u2019\n\u2018We will come and look at them,\u2019 said Strider, picking up a stick.\nFrodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared.\nThe sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-\nstripped branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches\nof light. They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the\ntree-trunks, holding their breath. There stood the trolls: three large\ntrolls. One was stooping, and the other two stood staring at him.\nStrider walked forward unconcernedly. \u2018Get up, old stone!\u2019 he\nsaid, and broke his stick upon the stooping troll.\nNothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the"}

Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a\nmatter of fact he had never more than half believed it. Even now he\nlooked at the stone trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic\nmight not suddenly bring them to life again.\n\u2018You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever\nknew about trolls,\u2019 said Strider. \u2018It is broad daylight with a bright\nsun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live\ntrolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed\nthat one of them has an old bird\u2019s nest behind his ear. That would\nbe a most unusual ornament for a live troll!\u2019\nThey all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of\nBilbo\u2019s first successful adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was\nwarm and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be\nlifting a little. They rested for some time in the glade, and took their\nmid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls\u2019 large legs.\n\u2018Won\u2019t somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?\u2019\nsaid Merry, when they had finished. \u2018We haven\u2019t had a song or a tale\nfor days.\u2019\n\u2018Not since Weathertop,\u2019 said Frodo. The others looked at him.\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry about me!\u2019 he added. \u2018I feel much better, but I don\u2019t\nthink I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his\nmemory.\u2019\n\u2018Come on, Sam!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018There\u2019s more stored in your head\nthan you let on about.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know about that,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But how would this suit?

Trover!\nThough dead he be, it belongs to he;\nSo hand the old bone over!\u2019\n\u2018For a couple o\u2019 pins,\u2019 says Troll, and grins,\n\u2018I\u2019ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.\nA bit o\u2019 fresh meat will go down sweet!\nI\u2019ll try my teeth on thee now.\nHee now! See now!\nI\u2019m tired o\u2019 gnawing old bones and skins;\nI\u2019ve a mind to dine on thee now.\u2019\nBut just as he thought his dinner was caught,\nHe found his hands had hold of naught.\nBefore he could mind, Tom slipped behind\nAnd gave him the boot to larn him.\nWarn him! Darn him!\nA bump o\u2019 the boot on the seat, Tom thought,\nWould be the way to larn him.\nBut harder than stone is the flesh and bone\nOf a troll that sits in the hills alone.\nAs well set your boot to the mountain\u2019s root,\nFor the seat of a troll don\u2019t feel it.\nPeel it! Heal it!"}
{"232": "Tom\u2019s leg is game, since home he came,\nAnd his bootless foot is lasting lame;\nBut Troll don\u2019t care, and he\u2019s still there\nWith the bone he boned from its owner.\nDoner! Boner!\nTroll\u2019s old seat is still the same,\nAnd the bone he boned from its owner!\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s a warning to us all!\u2019 laughed Merry. \u2018It is as well you\nused a stick, and not your hand, Strider!\u2019\n\u2018Where did you come by that, Sam?\u2019 asked Pippin. \u2018I\u2019ve never\nheard those words before.\u2019\nSam muttered something inaudible. \u2018It\u2019s out of his own head, of\ncourse,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this\njourney. First he was a conspirator, now he\u2019s a jester. He\u2019ll end up\nby becoming a wizard \u2013 or a warrior!\u2019\n\u2018I hope not,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I don\u2019t want to be neither!\u2019\nIn the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were prob-\nably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves\nhad used many years before. After a few miles they came out on the\ntop of a high bank above the Road. At this point the Road had left\nthe Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley, and now clung close to\nthe feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward among woods and\nheather-covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains. Not\nfar down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the grass. On it\nroughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes\nand secret marks.\n\u2018There!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018That must be the stone that marked the\nplace where the trolls\u2019 gold was hidden. How much is left of Bilbo\u2019s\nshare, I wonder, Frodo?\u2019\nFrodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought\nhome no treasure more perilous, nor less easy to part with. \u2018None at\nall,\u2019 he said. \u2018Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it\nwas really his, as it came from robbers.\u2019\nThe Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There\nwas no sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there was now no\nother possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank,\nand turning left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of\nthe hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed\ndown to meet them from the mountains ahead."}
{"233": "sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them.\nThey looked back, but they could not see far because of the many\nwindings and rollings of the Road. As quickly as they could they\nscrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and\nbilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small\npatch of thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among the\nbushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light,\nsome thirty feet below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They\nwere going fast, with a light clippety-clippety-clip. Then faintly, as if it\nwas blown away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a\ndim ringing, as of small bells tinkling.\n\u2018That does not sound like a Black Rider\u2019s horse!\u2019 said Frodo,\nlistening intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not,\nbut they all remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of\npursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and\nunfriendly. But Strider was now leaning forward, stooped to the\nground, with a hand to his ear, and a look of joy on his face.\nThe light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer\nand nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick\ntrotting feet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming\nin the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered\nand flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The\nrider\u2019s cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back;\nhis golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed. To Frodo\nit appeared that a white light was shining through the form and\nraiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.\nStrider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road,\nleaping with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved\nor called, the rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up\ntowards the thicket where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dis-\nmounted and ran to meet him calling out: Ai na vedui Du\u00b4nadan! Mae\ngovannen! His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their\nhearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No others that dwelt in the\nwide world had voices so fair to hear. But there seemed to be a note\nof haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was now speaking\nquickly and urgently to Strider.\nSoon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes\nand hurried down to the Road. \u2018This is Glorfindel, who dwells in\nthe house of Elrond,\u2019 said Strider.\n\u2018Hail, and well met at last!\u2019 said the Elf-lord to Frodo. \u2018I was sent\nfrom Rivendell to look for you. We feared that you were in danger\nupon the road.\u2019"}
{"234": "answered Glorfindel. \u2018Elrond received news that troubled him. Some\nof my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin,*\nlearned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they\ncould. They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were\nastray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not\nreturned. There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against\nthe Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and\nsouth. It was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit,\nand become lost in the Wilderness.\n\u2018It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of\nMitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three of\nthe servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and\nI pursued them westward. I came also upon two others, but they\nturned away southward. Since then I have searched for your trail.\nTwo days ago I found it, and followed it over the Bridge; and today\nI marked where you descended from the hills again. But come! There\nis no time for further news. Since you are here we must risk the peril\nof the Road and go. There are five behind us, and when they find\nyour trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind. And\nthey are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I fear\nthat we may find the Ford is already held against us.\u2019\nWhile Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened.\nFrodo felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since the sun began\nto sink the mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a\nshadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends. Now\npain assailed him, and he felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam\u2019s\narm.\n\u2018My master is sick and wounded,\u2019 said Sam angrily. \u2018He can\u2019t go\non riding after nightfall. He needs rest.\u2019\nGlorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him\ngently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.\nBriefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop,\nand of the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept,\nand handed it to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he\nlooked intently at it.\n\u2018There are evil things written on this hilt,\u2019 he said; \u2018though\nmaybe your eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach\nthe house of Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may!\nAlas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will\ndo what I can \u2013 but all the more do I urge you now to go on without\nrest.\u2019\nHe searched the wound on Frodo\u2019s shoulder with his fingers, and"}
{"235": "his face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. But Frodo\nfelt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down\nfrom his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk\nof evening seemed to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been\nwithdrawn. He saw his friends\u2019 faces more clearly again, and a\nmeasure of new hope and strength returned.\n\u2018You shall ride my horse,\u2019 said Glorfindel. \u2018I will shorten the stir-\nrups up to the saddle-skirts, and you must sit as tight as you can.\nBut you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I\ncommand him to bear. His pace is light and smooth; and if danger\npresses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even the\nblack steeds of the enemy cannot rival.\u2019\n\u2018No, he will not!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I shall not ride him, if I am to be\ncarried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind\nin danger.\u2019\nGlorfindel smiled. \u2018I doubt very much,\u2019 he said, \u2018if your friends\nwould be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would\nfollow you and leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and that\nwhich you bear that brings us all in peril.\u2019\nTo that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount\nGlorfindel\u2019s white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great\npart of the others\u2019 burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and\nfor a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find it hard\nto keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf. On he led them, into\nthe mouth of darkness, and still on under the deep clouded night.\nThere was neither star nor moon. Not until the grey of dawn did he\nallow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that time nearly\nasleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the sag\nof his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark\ndream.\nThey cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the\nroad-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have\nclosed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while\nthey slept, awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the\nmorning, and the clouds and mists of the night were gone.\n\u2018Drink this!\u2019 said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a\nlittle liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as\nspring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm\nin the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their\nlimbs as they drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and\ndried fruit (which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy"}
{"236": "They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the\nRoad again. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two\nbrief halts during the day\u2019s march. In this way they covered almost\ntwenty miles before nightfall, and came to a point where the Road\nbent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley, now\nmaking straight for the Bruinen. So far there had been no sign or\nsound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear; but often\nGlorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they lagged behind,\nand a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he spoke to\nStrider in the elf-tongue.\nBut however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the\nhobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along\ndizzy with weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet\nand legs. Frodo\u2019s pain had redoubled, and during the day things\nabout him faded to shadows of ghostly grey. He almost welcomed\nthe coming of night, for then the world seemed less pale and empty.\nThe hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next\nmorning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the\nFord, and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.\n\u2018Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,\u2019 said Glorfin-\ndel; \u2018for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us,\nand other danger may be waiting by the Ford.\u2019\nThe Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now\nin places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when\nthey could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came\nto a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of\ntall pine-trees, and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist\nwalls of red stone. Echoes ran along as they hurried forward; and\nthere seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own.\nAll at once, as if through a gate of light, the Road ran out again from\nthe end of the tunnel into the open. There at the bottom of a sharp\nincline they saw before them a long flat mile, and beyond that the\nFord of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown bank,\nthreaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains\nclimbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the\nfading sky.\nThere was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind\nthem; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through\nthe branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and\nlistened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.\n\u2018Fly!\u2019 he called. \u2018Fly! The enemy is upon us!\u2019"}
{"237": "way across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses gallop-\ning. Out of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black\nRider. He reined his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle.\nAnother followed him, and then another; then again two more.\n\u2018Ride forward! Ride!\u2019 cried Glorfindel to Frodo.\nHe did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him.\nChecking the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The Riders\nseemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a\nhill, dark and solid, while all the woods and land about them receded\nas if into a mist. Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently\ncommanding him to wait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in\nhim. His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and\nwith a red flash he drew it.\n\u2018Ride on! Ride on!\u2019 cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he\ncalled to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!\nAt once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along\nthe last lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses leaped\ndown the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry,\nsuch as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfar-\nthing far away. It was answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his\nfriends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other Riders\ncame flying. Two rode towards Frodo; two galloped madly towards\nthe Ford to cut off his escape. They seemed to him to run like the\nwind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as their courses converged\nwith his.\nFrodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no\nlonger see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even\ntheir great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of\nGlorfindel. He looked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed\nno chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that\nhad lain in ambush. He could see them clearly now: they appeared to\nhave cast aside their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in\nwhite and grey. Swords were naked in their pale hands; helms were\non their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they called to him with\nfell voices.\nFear now filled all Frodo\u2019s mind. He thought no longer of his\nsword. No cry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the\nhorse\u2019s mane. The wind whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the\nharness rang wild and shrill. A breath of deadly cold pierced him like\na spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse\nspeeding as if on wings, passed right before the face of the foremost\nRider."}
{"238": "up the stony path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across\nthe Ford.\nBut the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the\nhorse halted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine\nRiders at the water\u2019s edge below, and Frodo\u2019s spirit quailed before\nthe threat of their uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would\nprevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; and he felt that\nit was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the\nFord to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed. In any case\nhe felt that he was commanded urgently to halt. Hatred again stirred\nin him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.\nSuddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked\nat the water and reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright and\nbrandished his sword.\n\u2018Go back!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Go back to the Land of Mordor, and follow\nme no more!\u2019 His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The\nRiders halted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil. His enemies\nlaughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter. \u2018Come back! Come\nback!\u2019 they called. \u2018To Mordor we will take you!\u2019\n\u2018Go back!\u2019 he whispered.\n\u2018The Ring! The Ring!\u2019 they cried with deadly voices; and immedi-\nately their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed\nclosely by two others.\n\u2018By Elbereth and Lu\u00b4thien the Fair,\u2019 said Frodo with a last effort,\nlifting up his sword, \u2018you shall have neither the Ring nor me!\u2019\nThen the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up\nmenacing in his stirrups, and raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken\ndumb. He felt his tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring.\nHis sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared\nand snorted. The foremost of the black horses had almost set foot\nupon the shore.\nAt that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of\nloud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below\nhim rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of\nwaves. White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests, and\nhe half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white\nhorses with frothing manes. The three Riders that were still in the midst\nof the Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly\nunder angry foam. Those that were behind drew back in dismay.\nWith his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to\nhim that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a\nshining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms"}
{"239": "The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward\nin terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. Their piercing\ncries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away.\nThen Frodo felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed\nto rise and engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw\nno more."}

{"243": "Chapter 1\nMANY MEETINGS\nFrodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that\nhe had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on\nthe edge of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling\nlooked strange; it was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He\nlay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall,\nand listening to the sound of a waterfall.\n\u2018Where am I, and what is the time?\u2019 he said aloud to the ceiling.\n\u2018In the house of Elrond, and it is ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\u2019 said\na voice. \u2018It is the morning of October the twenty-fourth, if you want\nto know.\u2019\n\u2018Gandalf !\u2019 cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting\nin a chair by the open window.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after\nall the absurd things you have done since you left home.\u2019\nFrodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to\nargue, and in any case he did not think he would get the better of\nan argument. He was fully awake now, and the memory of his\njourney was returning: the disastrous \u2018short cut\u2019 through the Old\nForest; the \u2018accident\u2019 at The Prancing Pony; and his madness in put-\nting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking\nof all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to\nhis arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the\nsoft puffs of Gandalf \u2019s pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the\nwindow.\n\u2018Where\u2019s Sam?\u2019 Frodo asked at length. \u2018And are the others all\nright?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, they are all safe and sound,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018Sam was\nhere until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.\u2019\n\u2018What happened at the Ford?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It all seemed so dim,\nsomehow; and it still does.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,\u2019 answered Gandalf.\n\u2018The wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you\nwould have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you,\nmy dear hobbit! As you showed in the Barrow. That was touch and\ngo: perhaps the most dangerous moment of all. I wish you could\nhave held out at Weathertop.\u2019"}
{"244": "and afterwards there were other things to think about. How do you\nknow about it?\u2019\n\u2018You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,\u2019 said Gandalf gently,\n\u2018and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory.\nDo not worry! Though I said \u2018\u2018absurd\u2019\u2019 just now, I did not mean it.\nI think well of you \u2013 and of the others. It is no small feat to have\ncome so far, and through such dangers, still bearing the Ring.\u2019\n\u2018We should never have done it without Strider,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But\nwe needed you. I did not know what to do without you.\u2019\n\u2018I was delayed,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and that nearly proved our ruin.\nAnd yet I am not sure: it may have been better so.\u2019\n\u2018I wish you would tell me what happened!\u2019\n\u2018All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about\nanything today, by Elrond\u2019s orders.\u2019\n\u2018But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are\nquite as tiring,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I am wide awake now, and I remember\nso many things that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You\nought to tell me that at least.\u2019\n\u2018You will soon hear all you wish to know,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We shall\nhave a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At the moment I\nwill only say that I was held captive.\u2019\n\u2018You?\u2019 cried Frodo.\n\u2018Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,\u2019 said the wizard solemnly. \u2018There are\nmany powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater\nthan I am. Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time\nis coming. The Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth.\nWar is preparing!\u2019\n\u2018Then you knew of the Riders already \u2013 before I met them?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the\nBlack Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of\nthe Rings. But I did not know that they had arisen again or I should\nhave fled with you at once. I heard news of them only after I left you\nin June; but that story must wait. For the moment we have been\nsaved from disaster, by Aragorn.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid\nof him at first. Sam never quite trusted him, I think, not at any rate\nuntil we met Glorfindel.\u2019\nGandalf smiled. \u2018I have heard all about Sam,\u2019 he said. \u2018He has no\nmore doubts now.\u2019\n\u2018I am glad,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018For I have become very fond of Strider.\nWell, fond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he\nis strange, and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of you. I"}

He\nthinks less than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick\nwall in time (as they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-\nearth like Aragorn son of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over\nthe Sea is nearly at an end. It may be that this War of the Ring will\nbe their last adventure.\u2019\n\u2018Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old\nKings?\u2019 said Frodo in wonder. \u2018I thought they had all vanished long\nago. I thought he was only a Ranger.\u2019\n\u2018Only a Ranger!\u2019 cried Gandalf. \u2018My dear Frodo, that is just what\nthe Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people,\nthe Men of the West. They have helped me before; and I shall\nneed their help in the days to come; for we have reached Rivendell,\nbut the Ring is not yet at rest.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose not,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But so far my only thought has been\nto get here; and I hope I shan\u2019t have to go any further. It is very\npleasant just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and\nI find that has been as much as I want.\u2019\nHe fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. \u2018I\nhave been reckoning,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I can\u2019t bring the total up to\nOctober the twenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must\nhave reached the Ford by the twentieth.\u2019\n\u2018You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,\u2019 said\nGandalf. \u2018How do the side and shoulder feel now?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Frodo answered. \u2018They don\u2019t feel at all: which is\nan improvement, but\u2019 \u2013 he made an effort \u2013 \u2018I can move my arm\nagain a little. Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,\u2019 he added,\ntouching his left hand with his right.\n\u2018Good!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It is mending fast. You will soon be sound\nagain. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since\nyou were brought in.\u2019\n\u2018Days?\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought\nyou from the Ford on the night of the twentieth, and that is where\nyou lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has hardly\nleft your side, day or night, except to run messages. Elrond is a master\nof healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you\nthe truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some\nfragment of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be"}
{"246": "Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched\nblade that had vanished in Strider\u2019s hands. \u2018Don\u2019t be alarmed!\u2019 said\nGandalf. \u2018It is gone now. It has been melted. And it seems that\nHobbits fade very reluctantly. I have known strong warriors of the\nBig People who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter,\nwhich you bore for seventeen days.\u2019\n\u2018What would they have done to me?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018What were\nthe Riders trying to do?\u2019\n\u2018They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains\nin the wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like\nthey are, only weaker and under their command. You would have\nbecome a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord; and he would\nhave tormented you for trying to keep his Ring, if any greater torment\nwere possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand.\u2019\n\u2018Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!\u2019 said Frodo\nfaintly. \u2018I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I\nshould not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!\u2019\n\u2018Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018not to men-\ntion courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder\nwas pierced; and that was because you resisted to the last. But it was\na terribly narrow shave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while\nyou wore the Ring, for then you were half in the wraith-world yourself,\nand they might have seized you. You could see them, and they could\nsee you.\u2019\n\u2018I know,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018They were terrible to behold! But why could\nwe all see their horses?\u2019\n\u2018Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes\nthat they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have\ndealings with the living.\u2019\n\u2018Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other\nanimals are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of\nGlorfindel. The dogs howl and the geese scream at them.\u2019\n\u2018Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark\nLord in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There\nare orcs and trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have\nbeen and still are many Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive\nunder the Sun, and yet are under his sway. And their number is\ngrowing daily.\u2019\n\u2018What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear\nthe Dark Lord, and they may fly before him, but never again will\nthey listen to him or serve him. And here in Rivendell there live still"}
{"247": "have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds, and\nagainst both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power.\u2019\n\u2018I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow\ndim like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one\nof the mighty of the Firstborn. He is an Elf-lord of a house of princes.\nIndeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of\nMordor, for a while: and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There\nis power, too, of another kind in the Shire. But all such places will\nsoon become islands under siege, if things go on as they are going.\nThe Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength.\n\u2018Still,\u2019 he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin,\nwhile his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, \u2018we must\nkeep up our courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to\ndeath. You are in Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything\nfor the present.\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t any courage to keep up,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018but I am not\nworried at the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell me\nthe end of the affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be\ncontent for the present. After that I shall have another sleep, I think;\nbut I shan\u2019t be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story\nfor me.\u2019\nGandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at\nFrodo. The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were\nclear, and fully awake and aware. He was smiling, and there seemed\nto be little wrong with him. But to the wizard\u2019s eye there was a faint\nchange, just a hint as it were of transparency, about him, and especi-\nally about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet.\n\u2018Still that must be expected,\u2019 said Gandalf to himself. \u2018He is not\nhalf through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond\ncan foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled\nwith a clear light for eyes to see that can.\u2019\n\u2018You look splendid,\u2019 he said aloud. \u2018I will risk a brief tale without\nconsulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must\nsleep again. This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders\nmade straight for you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the\nguidance of their horses any longer: you had become visible to them,\nbeing already on the threshold of their world. And also the Ring drew\nthem. Your friends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have\nbeen ridden down. They knew that nothing could save you, if the\nwhite horse could not. The Riders were too swift to overtake, and\ntoo many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together"}
{"248": "Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by\na few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel\nknew that a flood would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and\nthen he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the\nriver. The moment the flood appeared, he rushed out, followed by\nAragorn and the others with flaming brands. Caught between fire\nand water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath, they were\ndismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness. Three were\ncarried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were now\nhurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.\u2019\n\u2018And is that the end of the Black Riders?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Their horses must have perished, and without\nthem they are crippled. But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so\neasily destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at\npresent. Your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they found\nyou lying on your face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under\nyou. The horse was standing guard beside you. You were pale and cold,\nand they feared that you were dead, or worse. Elrond\u2019s folk met them,\ncarrying you slowly towards Rivendell.\u2019\n\u2018Who made the flood?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018Elrond commanded it,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018The river of this valley\nis under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need\nto bar the Ford. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into\nthe water the flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few\ntouches of my own: you may not have noticed, but some of the waves\ntook the form of great white horses with shining white riders; and\nthere were many rolling and grinding boulders. For a moment I was\nafraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood would\nget out of hand and wash you all away. There is great vigour in the\nwaters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, it all comes back to me now,\u2019 said Frodo: \u2018the tremendous\nroaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies and\nall. But now we are safe!\u2019\nGandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. \u2018Yes,\nyou are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merry-\nmaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will\nall be there in places of honour.\u2019\n\u2018Splendid!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel\nand such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much\ntrouble and show me so much kindness.\u2019\n\u2018Well, there are many reasons why they should,\u2019 said Gandalf,\nsmiling. \u2018I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the"}
{"249": "was here and could hear all about it. It would have made him laugh.\nThe cow jumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!\u2019 With that\nhe fell fast asleep.\nFrodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea.\nThat house was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, \u2018a perfect house,\nwhether you like food or sleep or story-telling or singing, or just\nsitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all\u2019. Merely\nto be there was a cure for weariness, fear, and sadness.\nAs the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that\nhe no longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food\nand drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards. He\ngot out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as\nuseful again as it ever had been. He found laid ready clean garments\nof green cloth that fitted him excellently. Looking in a mirror he\nwas startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he\nremembered: it looked remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo\nwho used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; but the eyes\nlooked out at him thoughtfully.\n\u2018Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a\nlooking-glass,\u2019 he said to his reflection. \u2018But now for a merry meeting!\u2019\nHe stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.\nAt that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came\nin. He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He\nstroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away.\n\u2018Hullo, Sam!\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018It\u2019s warm!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt\nso cold through the long nights. But glory and trumpets!\u2019 he cried,\nturning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. \u2018It\u2019s\nfine to see you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come\nand see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was\njoking.\u2019\n\u2018I am ready,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Let\u2019s go and look for the rest of the\nparty!\u2019\n\u2018I can take you to them, sir,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It\u2019s a big house this, and\nvery peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what\nyou\u2019ll find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there!\nSome like kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children.\nAnd the music and the singing \u2013 not that I have had the time or the\nheart for much listening since we got here. But I\u2019m getting to know\nsome of the ways of the place.\u2019\n\u2018I know what you have been doing, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, taking his"}
{"250": "Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out\ninto a high garden above the steep bank of the river. He found his\nfriends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east.\nShadows had fallen in the valley below, but there was still a light on\nthe faces of the mountains far above. The air was warm. The sound\nof running and falling water was loud, and the evening was filled\nwith a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in\nElrond\u2019s gardens.\n\u2018Hurray!\u2019 cried Pippin, springing up. \u2018Here is our noble cousin!\nMake way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!\u2019\n\u2018Hush!\u2019 said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch.\n\u2018Evil things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should\nnot name them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master\nof the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out\nover the world. We are sitting in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.\u2019\n\u2018Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,\u2019 said\nPippin. \u2018He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible,\nsomehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could\nsing, if I knew the right song for the occasion.\u2019\n\u2018I feel like singing myself,\u2019 laughed Frodo. \u2018Though at the moment\nI feel more like eating and drinking.\u2019\n\u2018That will soon be cured,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018You have shown your\nusual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.\u2019\n\u2018More than a meal! A feast!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018As soon as Gandalf\nreported that you were recovered, the preparations began.\u2019 He had\nhardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by\nthe ringing of many bells.\nThe hall of Elrond\u2019s house was filled with folk: Elves for the most\npart, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was\nhis custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the\ndais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other\nside sat Gandalf.\nFrodo looked at them in wonder; for he had never before seen\nElrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right\nhand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought\nhe knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power.\nGandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long\nwhite hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made\nhim look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under\ngreat snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap\nsuddenly into fire."}
{"251": "and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in\nhis hand was strength.\nThe face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in\nit was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.\nHis hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a\ncirclet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them\nwas a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king\ncrowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the\nfulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty\namong both Elves and Men.\nIn the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall,\nthere was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look\nupon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that\nFrodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred. Young she was\nand yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost;\nher white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light\nof stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly\nshe looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one\nwho has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow\nher head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems,\nglittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a\ngirdle of leaves wrought in silver.\nSo it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen;\nArwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of\nLu\u00b4thien had come on earth again; and she was called Undo\u00b4miel, for\nshe was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land\nof her mother\u2019s kin, in Lo\u00b4 rien beyond the mountains, and was but\nlately returned to Rivendell to her father\u2019s house. But her brothers,\nElladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry; for they rode often far\nafield with the Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother\u2019s\ntorment in the dens of the orcs.\nSuch loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor\nimagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find\nthat he had a seat at Elrond\u2019s table among all these folk so high and\nfair. Though he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several\ncushions, he felt very small, and rather out of place; but that feeling\nquickly passed. The feast was merry and the food all that his hunger\ncould desire. It was some time before he looked about him again or\neven turned to his neighbours.\nHe looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to\nwait on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a\nguest of honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and"}
{"252": "Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance,\nrichly dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as\nwhite as the snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt,\nand round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo\nstopped eating to look at him.\n\u2018Welcome and well met!\u2019 said the dwarf, turning towards him.\nThen he actually rose from his seat and bowed. \u2018Glo\u00b4 in at your service,\u2019\nhe said, and bowed still lower.\n\u2018Frodo Baggins at your service and your family\u2019s,\u2019 said Frodo\ncorrectly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. \u2018Am I right\nin guessing that you are the Glo\u00b4 in, one of the twelve companions of\nthe great Thorin Oakenshield?\u2019\n\u2018Quite right,\u2019 answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and\ncourteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. \u2018And I do not ask, for\nI have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir\nof our friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on\nyour recovery.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you very much,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,\u2019 said Glo\u00b4in.\n\u2018I wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey.\nNothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps\nI should not inquire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not\nseem disposed to talk of this?\u2019\n\u2018I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,\u2019 said Frodo politely.\nHe guessed that even in Elrond\u2019s house the matter of the Ring was\nnot one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles\nfor a time. \u2018But I am equally curious,\u2019 he added, \u2018to learn what brings\nso important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.\u2019\nGlo\u00b4 in looked at him. \u2018If you have not heard, I think we will not\nspeak yet of that either. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long,\nI believe, and then we shall all hear many things. But there is much\nelse that may be told.\u2019\nThroughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo\nlistened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from\nthe Ring, seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Glo\u00b4 in\nhad much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland.\nFrodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the\nlord of many sturdy men, and to their land between the Mountains\nand Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.\n\u2018Indeed,\u2019 said Glo\u00b4in, \u2018if it were not for the Beornings, the passage\nfrom Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible.\nThey are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of"}
{"253": "are trusty, and that is much in these days. Nowhere are there any\nmen so friendly to us as the Men of Dale. They are good folk, the\nBardings. The grandson of Bard the Bowman rules them, Brand son\nof Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his realm now reaches\nfar south and east of Esgaroth.\u2019\n\u2018And what of your own people?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018There is much to tell, good and bad,\u2019 said Glo\u00b4 in; \u2018yet it is mostly\ngood: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the\nshadow of these times. If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you\ntidings gladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves\u2019 tongues\nrun on when speaking of their handiwork, they say.\u2019\nAnd with that Glo\u00b4in embarked on a long account of the doings\nof the Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite a\nlistener; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no\nattempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather\nlost among the strange names of people and places that he had never\nheard of before. He was interested, however, to hear that Da\u00b4in was\nstill King under the Mountain, and was now old (having passed his\ntwo hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. Of\nthe ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven\nwere still with him: Dwalin, Glo\u00b4in, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and\nBombur. Bombur was now so fat that he could not move himself\nfrom his couch to his chair at table, and it took six young dwarves\nto lift him.\n\u2018And what has become of Balin and Ori and O\u00b4in?\u2019 asked Frodo.\nA shadow passed over Glo\u00b4 in\u2019s face. \u2018We do not know,\u2019 he\nanswered. \u2018It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask\nthe advice of those that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak\nof merrier things!\u2019\nGlo\u00b4 in began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo\nabout their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain. \u2018We have\ndone well,\u2019 he said. \u2018But in metal-work we cannot rival our fathers,\nmany of whose secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen\nswords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that\nwere made before the dragon came. Only in mining and building\nhave we surpassed the old days. You should see the waterways of\nDale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You should see the\nstone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and cavernous\nstreets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the terraces\nand towers upon the Mountain\u2019s sides! Then you would see that we\nhave not been idle.\u2019\n\u2018Iwillcomeandseethem,ifeverIcan,\u2019saidFrodo.\u2018Howsurprised"}
{"254": "Glo\u00b4 in looked at Frodo and smiled. \u2018You were very fond of Bilbo\nwere you not?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018I would rather see him than all the towers\nand palaces in the world.\u2019\nAt length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and\nwent down the hall, and the company followed them in due order.\nThe doors were thrown open, and they went across a wide passage\nand through other doors, and came into a further hall. In it were no\ntables, but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the\ncarven pillars upon either side.\nFrodo found himself walking with Gandalf. \u2018This is the Hall of\nFire,\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018Here you will hear many songs and tales \u2013 if\nyou can keep awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty\nand quiet, and people come here who wish for peace, and thought.\nThere is always a fire here, all the year round, but there is little other\nlight.\u2019\nAs Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him,\nElvish minstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled,\nand Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were\ngathered together; the golden firelight played upon them and shim-\nmered in their hair. Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further\nend of the fire, a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back\npropped against a pillar. Beside him on the ground was a drinking-cup\nand some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were\never ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast. His\nhead seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark cloak\nwas drawn over his face.\nElrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. \u2018Awake,\nlittle master!\u2019 he said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he\nbeckoned to him. \u2018Now at last the hour has come that you have\nwished for, Frodo,\u2019 he said. \u2018Here is a friend that you have long\nmissed.\u2019\nThe dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face.\n\u2018Bilbo!\u2019 cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang\nforward.\n\u2018Hullo, Frodo my lad!\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018So you have got here at last.\nI hoped you would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting is in\nyour honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself ?\u2019\n\u2018Why weren\u2019t you there?\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018And why haven\u2019t I been\nallowed to see you before?\u2019\n\u2018Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have"}
{"255": "\u2018What were you doing?\u2019\n\u2018Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this\nis the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!\u2019 he said,\ncocking an eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no\nsign of sleepiness that Frodo could see. \u2018Wake up! I was not asleep,\nMaster Elrond. If you want to know, you have all come out from\nyour feast too soon, and you have disturbed me \u2013 in the middle of\nmaking up a song. I was stuck over a line or two, and was thinking\nabout them; but now I don\u2019t suppose I shall ever get them right.\nThere will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean\nout of my head. I shall have to get my friend the Du\u00b4nadan to help\nme. Where is he?\u2019\nElrond laughed. \u2018He shall be found,\u2019 he said. \u2018Then you two shall\ngo into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge\nit before we end our merrymaking.\u2019 Messengers were sent to find\nBilbo\u2019s friend, though none knew where he was, or why he had not\nbeen present at the feast.\nIn the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came\nquickly and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft\nvoices, oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them.\nBilbo had not much to say of himself. When he had left Hobbiton\nhe had wandered off aimlessly, along the Road or in the country\non either side; but somehow he had steered all the time towards\nRivendell.\n\u2018I got here without much adventure,\u2019 he said, \u2018and after a rest I\nwent on with the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan\u2019t travel\nagain. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, and here\nI have been. I have done this and that. I have written some more of\nmy book. And, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them\noccasionally: just to please me, I think; for, of course, they aren\u2019t\nreally good enough for Rivendell. And I listen and I think. Time\ndoesn\u2019t seem to pass here: it just is. A remarkable place altogether.\n\u2018I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the\nSouth, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about the Ring,\nof course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a\ngreat deal, he has become closer than ever these last few years. The\nDu\u00b4nadan has told me more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a\ndisturbance! It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner.\nI could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much\ntrouble. I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for\nit; but I am getting old, and they would not let me: Gandalf and\nElrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking"}
{"256": "\u2018And Gandalf said: \u2018\u2018The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do\nno good to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again.\u2019\u2019\nOdd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking\nafter you, so I let things be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and\nsound.\u2019 He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully.\n\u2018Have you got it here?\u2019 he asked in a whisper. \u2018I can\u2019t help feeling\ncurious, you know, after all I\u2019ve heard. I should very much like just\nto peep at it again.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I\u2019ve got it,\u2019 answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. \u2018It\nlooks just the same as ever it did.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,\u2019 said Bilbo.\nWhen he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring\nhad been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong.\nSlowly he drew it out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly\ndrew back the Ring. To his distress and amazement he found that\nhe was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen\nbetween them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled\ncreature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire\nto strike him.\nThe music and singing round them seemed to falter, and a silence\nfell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo\u2019s face and passed his hand across\nhis eyes. \u2018I understand now,\u2019 he said. \u2018Put it away! I am sorry: sorry\nyou have come in for this burden; sorry about everything. Don\u2019t\nadventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always\nhas to carry on the story. Well, it can\u2019t be helped. I wonder if it\u2019s\nany good trying to finish my book? But don\u2019t let\u2019s worry about it\nnow \u2013 let\u2019s have some real News! Tell me all about the Shire!\u2019\nFrodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly\na shred of memory. The light and music of Rivendell was about him\nagain. Bilbo smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from\nthe Shire that Frodo could tell \u2013 aided and corrected now and again\nby Sam \u2013 was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the\nleast tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton. They were\nso deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that they did not notice\nthe arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth. For many minutes he\nstood looking down at them with a smile.\nSuddenly Bilbo looked up. \u2018Ah, there you are at last, Du\u00b4nadan!\u2019\nhe cried.\n\u2018Strider!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018You seem to have a lot of names.\u2019\n\u2018Well, Strider is one that I haven\u2019t heard before, anyway,\u2019 said\nBilbo. \u2018What do you call him that for?\u2019"}
{"257": "\u2018And why do you call him Du\u00b4nadan?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018The Du\u00b4 nadan,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018He is often called that here. But I\nthought you knew enough Elvish at least to know du\u00b4n-adan: Man of\nthe West, Nu\u00b4meno\u00b4 rean. But this is not the time for lessons!\u2019 He\nturned to Strider. \u2018Where have you been, my friend? Why weren\u2019t\nyou at the feast? The Lady Arwen was there.\u2019\nStrider looked down at Bilbo gravely. \u2018I know,\u2019 he said. \u2018But often\nI must put mirth aside. Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the\nWild unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at\nonce.\u2019\n\u2018Well, my dear fellow,\u2019 said Bilbo, \u2018now you\u2019ve heard the news,\ncan\u2019t you spare me a moment? I want your help in something urgent.\nElrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of\nthe evening, and I am stuck. Let\u2019s go off into a corner and polish it\nup!\u2019\nStrider smiled. \u2018Come then!\u2019 he said. \u2018Let me hear it!\u2019\nFrodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen asleep.\nHe was alone and felt rather forlorn, although all about him the folk\nof Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent\nupon the music of the voices and the instruments, and they gave no\nheed to anything else. Frodo began to listen.\nAt first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words\nin elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him\nin a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed\nthat the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things\nthat he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit\nhall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon\nthe margins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and\nmore dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold\nand silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to\nbe comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him,\nand it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining\nweight into a deep realm of sleep.\nThere he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into\nrunning water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the\nvoice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the\nwords.\nEa\u00a8rendil was a mariner\nthat tarried in Arvernien;\nhe built a boat of timber felled"}

{"261": "\u2018Now we had better have it again,\u2019 said an Elf.\nBilbo got up and bowed. \u2018I am flattered, Lindir,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it\nwould be too tiring to repeat it all.\u2019\n\u2018Not too tiring for you,\u2019 the Elves answered laughing. \u2018You know\nyou are never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot\nanswer your question at one hearing!\u2019\n\u2018What!\u2019 cried Bilbo. \u2018You can\u2019t tell which parts were mine, and\nwhich were the Du\u00b4nadan\u2019s?\u2019\n\u2018It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals,\u2019\nsaid the Elf.\n\u2018Nonsense, Lindir,\u2019 snorted Bilbo. \u2018If you can\u2019t distinguish be-\ntween a Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined.\nThey\u2019re as different as peas and apples.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe.

I\u2019ll leave you to guess, if you want to.\u2019\nHe got up and came towards Frodo. \u2018Well, that\u2019s over,\u2019 he said\nin a low voice. \u2018It went off better than I expected. I don\u2019t often get\nasked for a second hearing. What did you think of it?\u2019\n\u2018I am not going to try and guess,\u2019 said Frodo smiling.\n\u2018You needn\u2019t,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018As a matter of fact it was all mine.\nExcept that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. He\nseemed to think it important. I don\u2019t know why. Otherwise he obvi-\nously thought the whole thing rather above my head, and he said\nthat if I had the cheek to make verses about Ea\u00a8rendil in the house\nof Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was right.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It seemed to me to fit somehow,\nthough I can\u2019t explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it\nseemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about. I\ndidn\u2019t understand that it was really you speaking until near the end.\u2019\n\u2018It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it,\u2019 said\nBilbo. \u2018Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the Elvish appetite\nfor music and poetry and tales.

Elrond was in his chair\nand the fire was on his face like summer-light upon the trees. Near\nhim sat the Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn\nstood beside her; his dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to\nbe clad in elven-mail, and a star shone on his breast. They spoke\ntogether, and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo that Arwen turned\ntowards him, and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and\npierced his heart.\nHe stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the Elvish\nsong fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. \u2018It is a song\nto Elbereth,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018They will sing that, and other songs of the\nBlessed Realm, many times tonight.

There\nthey sat for some while, looking through the window at the bright\nstars above the steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke\nno more of the small news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark\nshadows and perils that encompassed them, but of the fair things\nthey had seen in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars, of\ntrees, and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods.\nAt last there came a knock on the door. \u2018Begging your pardon,\u2019\nsaid Sam, putting in his head, \u2018but I was just wondering if you would\nbe wanting anything.\u2019\n\u2018And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,\u2019 replied Bilbo. \u2018I guess you\nmean that it is time your master went to bed.\u2019\n\u2018Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear, and he only\ngot up today for the first time.\u2019\n\u2018Quite right, Sam,\u2019 laughed Bilbo. \u2018You can trot off and tell Gandalf\nthat he has gone to bed.

{"263": "Chapter 2\nTHE COUNCIL OF ELROND\nNext day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked\nalong the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the\npale, cool sun rise above the far mountains, and shine down, slanting\nthrough the thin silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was\nglimmering, and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush.\nSam walked beside him, saying nothing, but sniffing the air, and\nlooking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great\nheights in the East. The snow was white upon their peaks.\nOn a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came\nupon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. \u2018Hullo! Good morning!\u2019 said\nBilbo. \u2018Feel ready for the great council?\u2019\n\u2018I feel ready for anything,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018But most of all I\nshould like to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like\nto get into those pine-woods up there.\u2019 He pointed away far up the\nside of Rivendell to the north.\n\u2018You may have a chance later,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But we cannot make\nany plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.\u2019\nSuddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. \u2018That\nis the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,\u2019 cried Gandalf. \u2018Come\nalong now! Both you and Bilbo are wanted.\u2019\nFrodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding\npath back to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment\nforgotten, trotted Sam.\nGandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends\nthe evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now\nglowing in the valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from\nthe foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace\nlay on the land. To Frodo his dangerous flight, and the rumours of\nthe darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the\nmemories of a troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to\nmeet them as they entered were grave.\nElrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about\nhim. Frodo saw Glorfindel and Glo\u00b4in; and in a corner alone Strider\nwas sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew\nFrodo to a seat by his side, and presented him to the company,"}
{"264": "ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.\u2019\nHe then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met\nbefore. There was a younger dwarf at Glo\u00b4in\u2019s side: his son Gimli.\nBeside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond\u2019s\nhousehold, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him was Galdor,\nan Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from\nC\u00b4\u0131rdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad in green\nand brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, the\nKing of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart\nwas a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed,\nproud and stern of glance.\nHe was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and\nindeed though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with\nfur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in\nwhich a single white stone was set; his locks were shorn about his\nshoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that\nnow was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with\nsudden wonder.\n\u2018Here,\u2019 said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, \u2018is Boromir, a man from\nthe South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I\nhave bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be\nanswered.\u2019\nNot all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be\ntold. Much was said of events in the world outside, especially in the\nSouth, and in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things\nFrodo had already heard many rumours; but the tale of Glo\u00b4 in was\nnew to him, and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It\nappeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts\nof the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled.\n\u2018It is now many years ago,\u2019 said Glo\u00b4in, \u2018that a shadow of disquiet\nfell upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive.\nWords began to be whispered in secret: it was said that we were\nhemmed in a narrow place, and that greater wealth and splendour\nwould be found in a wider world. Some spoke of Moria: the mighty\nworks of our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazad-du\u02c6m;\nand they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers\nto return.\u2019\nGlo\u00b4 in sighed. \u2018Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too\ndeep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast\nmansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we\nspoke of it again with longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has"}

For a while we had news and\nit seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and\na great work begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has\never come from Moria since.\n\u2018Then about a year ago a messenger came to Da\u00b4in, but not from\nMoria \u2013 from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Da\u00b4in to\nhis gate. The Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our\nfriendship. Rings he would give for it, such as he gave of old. And\nhe asked urgently concerning hobbits, of what kind they were, and\nwhere they dwelt. \u2018\u2018For Sauron knows,\u2019\u2019 said he, \u2018\u2018that one of these\nwas known to you on a time.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And\nthen his fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if\nhe could. \u2018\u2018As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks\nthis,\u2019\u2019 he said: \u2018\u2018that you should find this thief,\u2019\u2019 such was his word,\n\u2018\u2018and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that\nonce he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of\nyour good will. Find it, and three rings that the Dwarf-sires possessed\nof old shall be returned to you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours\nfor ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still lives and where,\nand you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord.\nRefuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood\nby shuddered, but Da\u00b4in said: \u2018\u2018I say neither yea nor nay. I must\nconsider this message and what it means under its fair cloak.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Consider well, but not too long,\u2019\u2019 said he.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018The time of my thought is my own to spend,\u2019\u2019 answered Da\u00b4in.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018For the present,\u2019\u2019 said he, and rode into the darkness.\n\u2018Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We\nneeded not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words\nheld both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power\nthat has re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us\nof old.

A part of his tale was known to some there, but the\nfull tale to none, and many eyes were turned to Elrond in fear and\nwonder as he told of the Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship\nwith Moria, and their eagerness for knowledge, by which Sauron\nensnared them. For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and\nthey received his aid and grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned\nall their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly in the Moun-\ntain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was\naware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was\nwar, and the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.\nThen through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but\nsince that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set\nit down in his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long\ntale, full of deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke,\nthe sun rode up the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased.\nOf Nu\u00b4menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the\nKings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne\nupon the wings of storm.

And yet not so many, nor so fair, as\nwhen Thangorodrim was broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was\nended for ever, and it was not so.\u2019\n\u2018You remember?\u2019 said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his\nastonishment. \u2018But I thought,\u2019 he stammered as Elrond turned\ntowards him, \u2018I thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.\u2019\n\u2018So it was indeed,\u2019 answered Elrond gravely. \u2018But my memory\nreaches back even to the Elder Days. Ea\u00a8rendil was my sire, who was\nborn in Gondolin before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter\nof Dior, son of Lu\u00b4thien of Doriath. I have seen three ages in the\nWest of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless victories.\n\u2018I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at\nthe Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we\nhad the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil,\nAeglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat\non the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell,\nand Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown,\nand Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his\nfather\u2019s sword, and took it for his own.\u2019\nAt this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. \u2018So that is what became\nof the Ring!\u2019 he cried. \u2018If ever such a tale was told in the South, it\nhas long been forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him that\nwe do not name; but we believed that it perished from the world in\nthe ruin of his first realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.\u2019\n\u2018Alas! yes,\u2019 said Elrond. \u2018Isildur took it, as should not have been.\nIt should have been cast then into Orodruin\u2019s fire nigh at hand where\nit was made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by\nhis father in that last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only C\u00b4\u0131rdan\nstood, and I. But Isildur would not listen to our counsel.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,\u2019\u2019 he\nsaid; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure\nit. But soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named\nin the North Isildur\u2019s Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what\nelse might have befallen him.\n\u2018Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few.\nSmall wonder is it that you have not heard them, Boromir.

Ana\u00b4rion was slain, and Isildur was slain; and\nGil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall there be any\nsuch league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the Firstborn\ndecrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that\nday the race of Nu\u00b4menor has decayed, and the span of their years\nhas lessened.\n\u2018In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden\nFields the Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of\nAnnu\u00b4minas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of\nValandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs,\nand that now too is desolate.

The might of Elrond is in wisdom\nnot in weapons, it is said. I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling\nof hard words. For on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came\nto my brother in a troubled sleep; and afterwards a like dream came\noft to him again, and once to me.\n\u2018In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was\na growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of\nit I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:\nSeek for the Sword that was broken:\nIn Imladris it dwells;\nThere shall be counsels taken\nStronger than Morgul-spells.\nThere shall be shown a token\nThat Doom is near at hand,\nFor Isildur\u2019s Bane shall waken,\nAnd the Halfling forth shall stand.\nOf these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our\nfather, Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of Gondor.\nThis only would he say, that Imladris was of old the name among\nthe Elves of a far northern dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt,\ngreatest of lore-masters. Therefore my brother, seeing how desperate\nwas our need, was eager to heed the dream and seek for Imladris;\nbut since the way was full of doubt and danger, I took the journey\nupon myself.

Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder\nof his riddle.\u2019\nThere was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was\nshaken by a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance\nto reveal the Ring, and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far\naway. The Ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them\nin his trembling hand.\n\u2018Behold Isildur\u2019s Bane!\u2019 said Elrond.\nBoromir\u2019s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. \u2018The\nHalfling!\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at\nlast? But why then should we seek a broken sword?\u2019\n\u2018The words were not the doom of Minas Tirith,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But\ndoom and great deeds are indeed at hand. For the Sword that was\nBroken is the Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell.\nIt has been treasured by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost;\nfor it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when\nthe Ring, Isildur\u2019s Bane, was found. Now you have seen the sword\nthat you have sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for the\nHouse of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?\u2019\n\u2018I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of\na riddle,\u2019 answered Boromir proudly. \u2018Yet we are hard pressed, and\nthe Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope \u2013 if such a\nthing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past.\u2019 He looked\nagain at Aragorn, and doubt was in his eyes.\nFrodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was\nannoyed on his friend\u2019s behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst\nout:\nAll that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken:"}

I am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I\nhave had a hard life and a long; and the leagues that lie between here\nand Gondor are a small part in the count of my journeys.

For here the heirs\nof Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto\nson for many generations.

Lonely men are we, Rangers\nof the wild, hunters \u2013 but hunters ever of the servants of the Enemy;\nfor they are found in many places, not in Mordor only.\n\u2018If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played\nanother part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and\nbright swords do not stay. You know little of the lands beyond your\nbounds. Peace and freedom, do you say? The North would have\nknown them little but for us. Fear would have destroyed them. But\nwhen dark things come from the houseless hills, or creep from sunless\nwoods, they fly from us. What roads would any dare to tread, what\nsafety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of simple men\nat night, if the Du\u00b4nedain were asleep, or were all gone into the grave?\n\u2018And yet less thanks have we than you.

Yet\nwe would not have it otherwise. If simple folk are free from care and\nfear, simple they will be, and we must be secret to keep them so.\nThat has been the task of my kindred, while the years have lengthened\nand the grass has grown.\n\u2018But now the world is changing once again.

And well is it that\nnot until this year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the\nfull truth.\n\u2018Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to\npass the doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly\nexplored his ways, and found thus that our fears were true: he was\nnone other than Sauron, our Enemy of old, at length taking shape\nand power again. Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dis-\nsuaded us from open deeds against him, and for long we watched\nhim only.

{"276": "\u2018 \u2018\u2018The Nine, the Seven, and the Three,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018had each their\nproper gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were\none of the lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled,\nmaybe, could still see and read.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know?\nThe maker. And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must\nhave a source. What hand save Sauron\u2019s ever held this thing, ere it\nwas lost? The hand of Isildur alone.\n\u2018With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to\nGondor. In former days the members of my order had been well\nreceived there, but Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long\nthe guest of the Lords of the City. Less welcome did the Lord\nDenethor show me then than of old, and grudgingly he permitted\nme to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days,\nand the beginnings of the City, read on!\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018For to me what\nwas is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless\nyou have more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long,\nyou will find naught that is not well known to me, who am master\nof the lore of this City.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records\nthat few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and\ntongues have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in\nMinas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself\nsince the kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur\ndid not march away straight from the war in Mordor, as some have\ntold the tale.\u2019\n\u2018Some in the North, maybe,\u2019 Boromir broke in. \u2018All know in\nGondor that he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his\nnephew Meneldil, instructing him, before he committed to him the\nrule of the South Kingdom. In that time he planted there the last\nsapling of the White Tree in memory of his brother.\u2019\n\u2018But in that time also he made this scroll,\u2019 said Gandalf; \u2018and that\nis not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns\nthe Ring, and thus wrote Isildur therein:\nThe Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom;\nbut records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of Elendil,\nlest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim.\n\u2018And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it."}
{"277": "even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth neither\nits beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at first was\nas clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. It is\nfashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in Mordor\nfor such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to be\na tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it\nsaith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall.\nThe Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron\u2019s hand, which was black\nand yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were\nthe gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed. But for my part\nI will risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair.\nIt is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.\n\u2018When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced\nwriting was indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and\nthe servants of the Tower. And what was said therein was already\nknown. For in the day that Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor,\nmaker of the Three, was aware of him, and from afar he heard him\nspeak these words, and so his evil purposes were revealed.\n\u2018At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went north-\nwards, messages came to me out of Lo\u00b4 rien that Aragorn had passed\nthat way, and that he had found the creature called Gollum. There-\nfore I went first to meet him and hear his tale. Into what deadly perils\nhe had gone alone I dared not guess.\u2019\n\u2018There is little need to tell of them,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018If a man must\nneeds walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of\nMorgul Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and\nI began my homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came sud-\ndenly on what I sought: the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool.\nBut now the trail was fresh and swift, and it led not to Mordor but\naway. Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed it, and then\nI had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere, peering in the water as the\ndark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was covered with green slime.\nHe will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle.\nNothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his\nteeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back,\nwatching him day and night, making him walk before me with a\nhalter on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and\nfood, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at\nlast and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should be\ndone; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for he stank. For my\npart I hope never to look upon him again; but Gandalf came and"}
{"278": "one thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo\nhas now told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since\nI had already guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum\u2019s ring\ncame out of the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned\nalso that he had possessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The\npower of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span;\nbut that power only the Great Rings wield.\n\u2018And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test\nthat I spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held\naloft, round and unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may still\nbe read, if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the\nfire a while. That I have done, and this I have read:\nAsh nazg durbatulu\u02c6k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulu\u02c6k\nagh burzum-ishi krimpatul.\u2019\nThe change in the wizard\u2019s voice was astounding. Suddenly it\nbecame menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to\npass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All\ntrembled, and the Elves stopped their ears.\n\u2018Never before has any voice dared to utter words of that tongue\nin Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,\u2019 said Elrond, as the shadow passed\nand the company breathed once more.\n\u2018And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,\u2019 answered\nGandalf. \u2018Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For\nif that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West,\nthen let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise\nhave declared: the treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice;\nand in it lies a great part of his strength of old. Out of the Black\nYears come the words that the Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew\nthat they had been betrayed:\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to\nbring them all and in the Darkness bind them.\n\u2018Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He\nwas loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt\nthat he went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from\nhim. Thus the Enemy knows now that the One is found, that it was\nlong in the Shire; and since his servants have pursued it almost to\nour door, he soon will know, already he may know, even as I speak,"}
{"279": "All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. \u2018He is a\nsmall thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What\nbecame of him? To what doom did you put him?\u2019\n\u2018He is in prison, but no worse,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018He had suffered\nmuch. There is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of\nSauron lies black on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely\nkept by the watchful Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and\ngives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered.\nHe could work much mischief still, if he were free. And I do not\ndoubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand.\u2019\n\u2018Alas! alas!\u2019 cried Legolas, and in his fair Elvish face there was\ngreat distress. \u2018The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told.\nThey are not good, but only here have I learned how evil they may\nseem to this company. Sme\u00b4agol, who is now called Gollum, has\nescaped.\u2019\n\u2018Escaped?\u2019 cried Aragorn. \u2018That is ill news indeed. We shall all\nrue it bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their\ntrust?\u2019\n\u2018Not through lack of watchfulness,\u2019 said Legolas; \u2018but perhaps\nthrough over-kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from\nothers, and that more is known of our doings than we could wish.\nWe guarded this creature day and night, at Gandalf \u2019s bidding, much\nthough we wearied of the task. But Gandalf bade us hope still for\nhis cure, and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons\nunder the earth, where he would fall back into his old black\nthoughts.\u2019\n\u2018You were less tender to me,\u2019 said Glo\u00b4 in with a flash of his eyes,\nas old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places\nof the Elven-king\u2019s halls.\n\u2018Now come!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Pray, do not interrupt, my good Glo\u00b4 in.\nThat was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all the\ngrievances that stand between Elves and Dwarves are to be brought\nup here, we may as well abandon this Council.\u2019\nGlo\u00b4in rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. \u2018In the days of fair\nweather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree\nstanding alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we\nlet him mount up to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind;\nbut we set a guard at the tree\u2019s foot. One day he refused to come\ndown, and the guards had no mind to climb after him: he had learned\nthe trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands;\nso they sat by the tree far into the night.\n\u2018It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that"}
{"280": "and were unused to the woods. When the battle was over, we found\nthat Gollum was gone, and his guards were slain or taken. It then\nseemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue, and\nthat he knew of it beforehand. How that was contrived we cannot\nguess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy are many.\nThe dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon\u2019s fall\nhave returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil\nplace, save where our realm is maintained.\n\u2018We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among\nthose of many Orcs, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going south.\nBut ere long it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt;\nfor we were drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil\nplace; we do not go that way.\u2019\n\u2018Well, well, he is gone,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We have no time to seek\nfor him again. He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet\nthat neither he nor Sauron have foreseen.\n\u2018And now I will answer Galdor\u2019s other questions. What of\nSaruman? What are his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must\ntell in full, for only Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief; but it\nwill bear on all that we must resolve. It is the last chapter in the Tale\nof the Ring, so far as it has yet gone.\n\u2018At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was\non my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land;\nfor I had a foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but\ndrawing near. There messages reached me telling me of war and\ndefeat in Gondor, and when I heard of the Black Shadow a chill\nsmote my heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives from the\nSouth; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they\nwould not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along\nthe Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting\non a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was\nRadagast the Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the\nborders of Mirkwood. He is one of my order, but I had not seen him\nfor many a year.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Gandalf !\u2019\u2019 he cried. \u2018\u2018I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in\nthese parts. All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region\nwith the uncouth name of Shire.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Your information was correct,\u2019\u2019 I said. \u2018\u2018But do not put it that\nway, if you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the borders of\nthe Shire now. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing.\nYou were never a traveller, unless driven by great need.\u2019\u2019"}
{"281": "whispered. \u2018\u2018The Nine are abroad again. They have crossed the River\nsecretly and are moving westward. They have taken the guise of riders\nin black.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018The Enemy must have some great need or purpose,\u2019\u2019 said Rada-\ngast; \u2018\u2018but what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate\nparts, I cannot guess.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\u2019 said I.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news\nof a land called Shire.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018\u2018The Shire,\u2019\u2019 I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might\nfear to withstand the Nine, when they are gathered together under\ntheir fell chieftain. A great king and sorcerer he was of old, and now\nhe wields a deadly fear. \u2018\u2018Who told you, and who sent you?\u2019\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Saruman the White,\u2019\u2019 answered Radagast. \u2018\u2018And he told me to\nsay that if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid\nat once, or it will be too late.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is\nthe greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a\nmaster of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs\nand beasts, and birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has\nlong studied the arts of the Enemy himself, and thus we have often\nbeen able to forestall him. It was by the devices of Saruman that we\ndrove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he had found some\nweapons that would drive back the Nine.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I will go to Saruman,\u2019\u2019 I said.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Then you must go now,\u2019\u2019 said Radagast; \u2018\u2018for I have wasted time\nin looking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find\nyou before Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out\nfrom this spot, you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover\nthe land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once.\u2019\u2019 And with\nthat he mounted and would have ridden straight off.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Stay a moment!\u2019\u2019 I said. \u2018\u2018We shall need your help, and the help\nof all things that will give it. Send out messages to all the beasts and\nbirds that are your friends. Tell them to bring news of anything that\nbears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent\nto Orthanc.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I will do that,\u2019\u2019 he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after\nhim.\n\u2018I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far\nalready that day, and I was as weary as my horse; and I needed to"}
{"282": "\u2018However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend\nthe innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at\nlong last to the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard,\nin the end of the Misty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan.\nAnd Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies\nbetween the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills of Ered\nNimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But Isengard is a circle\nof sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, and in the midst\nof that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was not made by\nSaruman, but by the Men of Nu\u00b4menor long ago; and it is very tall\nand has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot\nbe reached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle\nthere is only one gate.\n\u2018Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall\nof rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were\non the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode\nunder the arch, and the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly\nI was afraid, though I knew no reason for it.\n\u2018But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of\nSaruman; and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber.\nHe wore a ring on his finger.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018So you have come, Gandalf,\u2019\u2019 he said to me gravely; but in his\neyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his\nheart.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Yes, I have come,\u2019\u2019 I said. \u2018\u2018I have come for your aid, Saruman\nthe White.\u2019\u2019 And that title seemed to anger him.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Have you indeed, Gandalf the Grey!\u2019\u2019 he scoffed. \u2018\u2018For aid? It\nhas seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one\nso cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning\nhimself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018I looked at him and wondered. \u2018\u2018But if I am not deceived,\u2019\u2019 said\nI, \u2018\u2018things are now moving which will require the union of all our\nstrength.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018That may be so,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but the thought is late in coming\nto you. How long, I wonder, have you concealed from me, the head\nof the Council, a matter of greatest import? What brings you now\nfrom your lurking-place in the Shire?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018The Nine have come forth again,\u2019\u2019 I answered. \u2018\u2018They have\ncrossed the River. So Radagast said to me.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Radagast the Brown!\u2019\u2019 laughed Saruman, and he no longer con-\ncealed his scorn. \u2018\u2018Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple!\nRadagast the Fool! Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set"}
{"283": "For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many\nColours!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white,\nwere not so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they\nshimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I liked white better,\u2019\u2019 I said.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018White!\u2019\u2019 he sneered. \u2018\u2018It serves as a beginning. White cloth may\nbe dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can\nbe broken.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018In which case it is no longer white,\u2019\u2019 said I. \u2018\u2018And he that breaks\na thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take\nfor friends,\u2019\u2019 said he. \u2018\u2018I have not brought you hither to be instructed\nby you, but to give you a choice.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were\nmaking a speech long rehearsed. \u2018\u2018The Elder Days are gone. The\nMiddle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The\ntime of the Elves is over, but our time is at hand: the world of Men,\nwhich we must rule. But we must have power, power to order all\nthings as we will, for that good which only the Wise can see.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper!\u2019\u2019 he said, coming\nnear and speaking now in a softer voice. \u2018\u2018I said we, for we it may\nbe, if you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old\nallies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in\nElves or dying Nu\u00b4menor. This then is one choice before you, before\nus. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There\nis hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward\nfor those that aided it. As the Power grows, its proved friends will\nalso grow; and the Wise, such as you and I, may with patience come\nat last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we\ncan keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by\nthe way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: Knowledge,\nRule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to\naccomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends.\nThere need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs,\nonly in our means.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Saruman,\u2019\u2019 I said, \u2018\u2018I have heard speeches of this kind before,\nbut only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive\nthe ignorant. I cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary\nmy ears.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. \u2018\u2018Well,\nI see that this wise course does not commend itself to you,\u2019\u2019 he said."}
{"284": "Gandalf ?\u2019\u2019 he whispered. \u2018\u2018Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could\ncommand that, then the Power would pass to us. That is in truth\nwhy I brought you here. For I have many eyes in my service, and I\nbelieve that you know where this precious thing now lies. Is it not\nso? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what is your business\nthere?\u2019\u2019 As he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone\nsuddenly in his eyes.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Saruman,\u2019\u2019 I said, standing away from him, \u2018\u2018only one hand at\na time can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble\nto say we! But I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news\nof it to you, now that I learn your mind. You were head of the\nCouncil, but you have unmasked yourself at last. Well, the choices\nare, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or to yourself. I will take neither.\nHave you others to offer?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018He was cold now and perilous. \u2018\u2018Yes,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I did not expect\nyou to show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the\nchance of aiding me willingly, and so saving yourself much trouble\nand pain. The third choice is to stay here, until the end.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Until what end?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find\nmeans to persuade you. Or until it is found in your despite, and the\nRuler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting\nreward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,\u2019\u2019 said I.\nHe laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it.\n\u2018They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc,\nin the place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars.\nThere is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps,\nand the valley below seems far away. I looked on it and saw that,\nwhereas it had once been green and fair, it was now filled with pits\nand forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in Isengard, for Saruman\nwas mustering a great force on his own account, in rivalry of Sauron\nand not in his service, yet. Over all his works a dark smoke hung and\nwrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on an island\nin the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were\nbitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to\npace to and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North.\n\u2018That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the\nwords of Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard\nI had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was\never in my heart for my friends in the Shire; but still I had some"}
{"285": "began. And both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded. For my\nhope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded\non the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls\nto answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it.\nBut in the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to\nthink that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter\nin the Shire far away.\u2019\n\u2018I saw you!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018You were walking backwards and for-\nwards. The moon shone in your hair.\u2019\nGandalf paused astonished and looked at him. \u2018It was only a\ndream,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite\nforgotten it. It came some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.\u2019\n\u2018Then it was late in coming,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018as you will see. I was\nin an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have\nseldom been in such need, and do not bear such misfortune well.\nGandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider\u2019s treacherous web! Yet\neven the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.\n\u2018At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast\nhad also fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his\nvoice or in his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone\nto Isengard, or I should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed,\nand he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger. It would\nhave been useless in any case to try and win over the honest Radagast\nto treachery. He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me.\n\u2018That was the undoing of Saruman\u2019s plot. For Radagast knew no\nreason why he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards\nMirkwood where he had many friends of old. And the Eagles of the\nMountains went far and wide, and they saw many things: the gather-\ning of wolves and the mustering of Orcs; and the Nine Riders going\nhither and thither in the lands; and they heard news of the escape of\nGollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me.\n\u2018So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon,\nand Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great Eagles, came\nunlooked-for to Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle.\nThen I spoke to him and he bore me away, before Saruman was\naware. I was far from Isengard, ere the wolves and orcs issued from\nthe gate to pursue me.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018How far can you bear me?\u2019\u2019 I said to Gwaihir.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Many leagues,\u2019\u2019 said he, \u2018\u2018but not to the ends of the earth. I was\nsent to bear tidings not burdens.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Then I must have a steed on land,\u2019\u2019 I said, \u2018\u2018and a steed surpass-\ningly swift, for I have never had such need of haste before.\u2019\u2019"}
{"286": "for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell,\nand there are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale\nbetween the Misty Mountains and the White.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think?\u2019\u2019 I said\nto Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018They pay a tribute of horses,\u2019\u2019 he answered, \u2018\u2018and send many\nyearly to Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke.\nBut if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot\nbe long delayed.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have\nlengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In\nRohan I found evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king\nof the land would not listen to my warnings. He bade me take a\nhorse and be gone; and I chose one much to my liking, but little to\nhis. I took the best horse in his land, and I have never seen the like\nof him.\u2019\n\u2018Then he must be a noble beast indeed,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018and it\ngrieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn\nthat Sauron levies such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that\nland.\u2019\n\u2018Nor is it now, I will swear,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018It is a lie that comes\nfrom the Enemy. I know the Men of Rohan, true and valiant, our\nallies, dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.\u2019\n\u2018The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,\u2019 answered Aragorn.\n\u2018Saruman has fallen under it. Rohan is beset. Who knows what you\nwill find there, if ever you return?\u2019\n\u2018Not this at least,\u2019 said Boromir, \u2018that they will buy their lives with\nhorses. They love their horses next to their kin. And not without\nreason, for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the\nNorth, far from the Shadow, and their race, as that of their masters,\nis descended from the free days of old.\u2019\n\u2018True indeed!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018And there is one among them that\nmight have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of\nthe Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind.\nShadowfax they called him.

Light is his footfall!\nNever before had any man mounted him, but I took him and I tamed\nhim, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo\nwas on the Barrow-downs, though I set out from Rohan only when\nhe set out from Hobbiton.\n\u2018ButfeargrewinmeasIrode.EverasIcamenorthIheardtidings"}
{"287": "remained on the eastern borders, not far from the Greenway, and\nsome invaded the Shire from the south. I came to Hobbiton and\nFrodo had gone; but I had words with old Gamgee. Many words\nand few to the point. He had much to say about the shortcomings\nof the new owners of Bag End.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t abide changes,\u2019\u2019 said he, \u2018\u2018not at my time of life, and\nleast of all changes for the worst.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Changes for the worst,\u2019\u2019 he\nrepeated many times.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Worst is a bad word,\u2019\u2019 I said to him, \u2018\u2018and I hope you do not\nlive to see it.\u2019\u2019 But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had\nleft Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman\nhad come to the Hill the same evening. Then I rode on in fear. I\ncame to Buckland and found it in uproar, as busy as a hive of ants\nthat has been stirred with a stick. I came to the house at Crickhollow,\nand it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a\ncloak that had been Frodo\u2019s. Then for a while hope left me, and I\ndid not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; but I\nrode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went many\nways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had\nridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words\nthat might be said to the innkeeper.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Butterbur they call him,\u2019\u2019 thought I. \u2018\u2018If this delay was his fault,\nI will melt all the butter in him. I will roast the old fool over a slow\nfire.\u2019\u2019 He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down\nflat and began to melt on the spot.\u2019\n\u2018What did you do to him?\u2019 cried Frodo in alarm. \u2018He was really\nvery kind to us and did all that he could.\u2019\nGandalf laughed. \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid!\u2019 he said. \u2018I did not bite, and I\nbarked very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of\nhim, when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. How\nit had happened I could not then guess, but I learned that you had\nbeen in Bree the night before, and had gone off that morning with\nStrider.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Strider!\u2019\u2019 I cried, shouting for joy.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir,\u2019\u2019 said Butterbur, mistaking me. \u2018\u2018He\ngot at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they took up with\nhim. They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful,\nyou might say.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman!\u2019\u2019 said I. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s\nthe best news I have had since Midsummer; it\u2019s worth a gold piece at\nthe least. May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing\nexcellence for seven years!\u2019\u2019 said I. \u2018\u2018Now I can take a night\u2019s rest,"}
{"288": "\u2018So I stayed there that night, wondering much what had become\nof the Riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree,\nit seemed. But in the night we heard more. Five at least came from\nthe west, and they threw down the gates and passed through Bree\nlike a howling wind; and the Bree-folk are still shivering and ex-\npecting the end of the world. I got up before dawn and went after\nthem.\n\u2018I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened.\nTheir Captain remained in secret away south of Bree, while two rode\nahead through the village, and four more invaded the Shire. But\nwhen these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to\ntheir Captain with tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a\nwhile, except by their spies. The Captain then sent some eastward\nstraight across country, and he himself with the rest rode along the\nRoad in great wrath.\n\u2018I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before\nsundown on my second day from Bree \u2013 and they were there before\nme. They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger\nand they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky. But they\nclosed round at night, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old\nring of Amon Su\u02c6l. I was hard put to it indeed: such light and flame\ncannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old.\n\u2018At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope\nto do more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness,\nand it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. So\nI had to trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off,\nand yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders\ndid indeed follow me, but they turned back after a while and made\nfor the Ford, it seems. That helped a little, for there were only five,\nnot nine, when your camp was attacked.\n\u2018I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Hoarwell and\nthrough the Ettenmoors, and down from the north. It took me nearly\nfifteen days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks\nof the troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I sent him back to his\nmaster; but a great friendship has grown between us, and if I have\nneed he will come at my call. But so it was that I came to Rivendell\nonly two days before the Ring, and news of its peril had already been\nbrought here \u2013 which proved well indeed.\n\u2018And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the\nothers forgive the length of it. But such a thing has not happened\nbefore, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised.\nAn account to the Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required,"}
{"289": "here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose.\nWhat shall we do with it?\u2019\nThere was a silence. At last Elrond spoke again.\n\u2018This is grievous news concerning Saruman,\u2019 he said; \u2018for we\ntrusted him and he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous to study\ntoo deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such falls\nand betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have\nheard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have\nknown few hobbits, save Bilbo here; and it seems to me that he is\nperhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him. The world\nhas changed much since I last was on the westward roads.\n\u2018The Barrow-wights we know by many names; and of the Old\nForest many tales have been told: all that now remains is but an\noutlier of its northern march. Time was when a squirrel could go\nfrom tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of\nIsengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and\nstrange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still\nthe same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then\nwas older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar\nwe called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he\nhas since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by\nNorthern Men, and other names beside. He is a strange creature,\nbut maybe I should have summoned him to our Council.\u2019\n\u2018He would not have come,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?\u2019\nasked Erestor. \u2018It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.\u2019\n\u2018No, I should not put it so,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Say rather that the\nRing has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot\nalter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is\nwithdrawn into a little land, within bounds that he has set, though\nnone can see them, waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will\nnot step beyond them.\u2019\n\u2018But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,\u2019 said\nErestor. \u2018Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever\nharmless?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018not willingly. He might do so, if all the free\nfolk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need.\nAnd if he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely\nthrow it away. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be\na most unsafe guardian; and that alone is answer enough.\u2019\n\u2018But in any case,\u2019 said Glorfindel, \u2018to send the Ring to him would"}
{"290": "could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding\nplace and would bend all his power towards it. Could that power be\ndefied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the end, if all\nelse is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First; and then\nNight will come.\u2019\n\u2018I know little of Iarwain save the name,\u2019 said Galdor; \u2018but Glorfin-\ndel, I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless\nsuch power is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can\ntorture and destroy the very hills. What power still remains lies with\nus, here in Imladris, or with C\u00b4\u0131rdan at the Havens, or in Lo\u00b4 rien. But\nhave they the strength, have we here the strength to withstand the\nEnemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, when all else is overthrown?\u2019\n\u2018I have not the strength,\u2019 said Elrond; \u2018neither have they.\u2019\n\u2018Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength,\u2019\nsaid Glorfindel, \u2018two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it\nover the Sea, or to destroy it.\u2019\n\u2018But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any\ncraft that we here possess,\u2019 said Elrond. \u2018And they who dwell beyond\nthe Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth;\nit is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.\u2019\n\u2018Then,\u2019 said Glorfindel, \u2018let us cast it into the deeps, and so make\nthe lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that even at the\nCouncil his feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the\nRing was not lost for ever, but wished us to think so; for he began\nto lust for it for himself. Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it\nwould be safe.\u2019\n\u2018Not safe for ever,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018There are many things in the\ndeep waters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not our part\nhere to take thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or\nfor a passing age of the world. We should seek a final end of this\nmenace, even if we do not hope to make one.\u2019\n\u2018And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,\u2019 said Galdor.\n\u2018If the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the\nSea is now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron\nwill expect us to take the western way, when he learns what has\nbefallen. He soon will. The Nine have been unhorsed indeed, but\nthat is but a respite, ere they find new steeds and swifter. Only the\nwaning might of Gondor stands now between him and a march in\npower along the coasts into the North; and if he comes, assailing the\nWhite Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no\nescape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.\u2019\n\u2018Long yet will that march be delayed,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018Gondor"}
{"291": "\u2018And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,\u2019 said\nGaldor. \u2018And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.\u2019\n\u2018Then,\u2019 said Erestor, \u2018there are but two courses, as Glorfindel\nalready has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But\nboth are beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?\u2019\n\u2018None here can do so,\u2019 said Elrond gravely. \u2018At least none can\nforetell what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it\nseems to me now clear which is the road that we must take. The\nwestward road seems easiest. Therefore it must be shunned. It will\nbe watched. Too often the Elves have fled that way. Now at this last\nwe must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope,\nif hope it be. To walk into peril \u2013 to Mordor. We must send the Ring\nto the Fire.\u2019\nSilence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon\na sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness\nin his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was\nfingering his great horn and frowning. At length he spoke.\n\u2018I do not understand all this,\u2019 he said. \u2018Saruman is a traitor, but\ndid he not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of\nhiding and destroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring\nhas come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding\nit the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is\nwhat he most fears, I deem.\n\u2018The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but\nthey may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a\nweapon. Let the Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you\nsay. Take it and go forth to victory!\u2019\n\u2018Alas, no,\u2019 said Elrond. \u2018We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we\nnow know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone,\nand is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone\nto wield at will, save only those who have already a great power of\ntheir own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very\ndesire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise\nshould with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own\narts, he would then set himself on Sauron\u2019s throne, and yet another\nDark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring\nshould be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger\neven to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron\nwas not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take the Ring\nto wield it.\u2019\n\u2018Nor I,\u2019 said Gandalf."}
{"292": "we have. And at the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we\nwill fight on. Mayhap the Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the\ntide \u2013 if the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only,\nbut the sinews of the Kings of Men.\u2019\n\u2018Who can tell?\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But we will put it to the test one\nday.\u2019\n\u2018May the day not be too long delayed,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018For though\nI do not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that\nothers fought also with all the means that they have.\u2019\n\u2018Then be comforted,\u2019 said Elrond. \u2018For there are other powers\nand realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. Anduin\nthe Great flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the\nGates of Gondor.\u2019\n\u2018Still it might be well for all,\u2019 said Glo\u00b4 in the Dwarf, \u2018if all these\nstrengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league.\nOther rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our\nneed. The Seven are lost to us \u2013 if Balin has not found the ring of\nThro\u00b4r, which was the last; naught has been heard of it since Thro\u00b4r\nperished in Moria. Indeed I may now reveal that it was partly in hope\nto find that ring that Balin went away.\u2019\n\u2018Balin will find no ring in Moria,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Thro\u00b4r gave it to\nThra\u00b4in his son, but not Thra\u00b4in to Thorin. It was taken with torment\nfrom Thra\u00b4in in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, alas!\u2019 cried Glo\u00b4 in. \u2018When will the day come of our revenge?\nBut still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves?\nVery mighty Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet\nthey too were made by the Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see\nElf-lords here. Will they not say?\u2019\nThe Elves returned no answer. \u2018Did you not hear me, Glo\u00b4 in?\u2019 said\nElrond. \u2018The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch\nthem. But of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this\nhour of doubt I may now say. They are not idle. But they were not\nmade as weapons of war or conquest: that is not their power. Those\nwho made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded\nwealth, but understanding, making, and healing, to preserve all things\nunstained. These things the Elves of Middle-earth have in some\nmeasure gained, though with sorrow. But all that has been wrought\nby those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing, and their\nminds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the\nOne. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his\npurpose.\u2019\n\u2018But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed,"}
{"293": "that the Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then\nbecome free, and their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that\nhe has wrought. But maybe when the One has gone, the Three will\nfail, and many fair things will fade and be forgotten. That is my\nbelief.\u2019\n\u2018Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,\u2019 said Glorfindel,\n\u2018if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his\ndominion be taken away for ever.\u2019\n\u2018Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,\u2019 said\nErestor, \u2018and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the\nfinding of the Fire in which it was made? That is the path of despair.\nOf folly I would say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid\nme.\u2019\n\u2018Despair, or folly?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It is not despair, for despair is\nonly for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is\nwisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been\nweighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false\nhope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy!\nFor he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of\nhis malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for\npower; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will\nnot enter that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we may seek\nto destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of reckoning.\u2019\n\u2018At least for a while,\u2019 said Elrond. \u2018The road must be trod, but it\nwill be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far\nupon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much\nhope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the\nwheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while\nthe eyes of the great are elsewhere.\u2019\n\u2018Very well, very well, Master Elrond!\u2019 said Bilbo suddenly. \u2018Say\nno more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly\nhobbit started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I\nwas very comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want\nto know, I am just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting:\nand he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good\nending, and none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall\nhave to alter that: it does not look like coming true; and anyway there\nwill evidently have to be several more chapters, if I live to write them.\nIt is a frightful nuisance. When ought I to start?\u2019\nBoromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his\nlipswhenhesawthatalltheothersregardedtheoldhobbitwithgrave"}
{"294": "this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you know well\nenough now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only\na small part is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow!\nThough the word was meant, and we do not doubt that under jest\nyou are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo.\nYou cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need my\nadvice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a\nrecorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending unaltered! There\nis still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when they come\nback.\u2019\nBilbo laughed. \u2018I have never known you give me pleasant advice\nbefore,\u2019 he said. \u2018As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I\nwonder if this advice is not bad. Still, I don\u2019t suppose I have the\nstrength or luck left to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have\nnot. But tell me: what do you mean by they?\u2019\n\u2018The messengers who are sent with the Ring.\u2019\n\u2018Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this\nCouncil has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive\non speech alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only\nan old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon. Can\u2019t we think of some\nnames now? Or put it off till after dinner?\u2019\nNo one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo\nglanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the\nCouncil sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread\nfell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom\nthat he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be\nspoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by\nBilbo\u2019s side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he\nspoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will\nwas using his small voice.\n\u2018I will take the Ring,\u2019 he said, \u2018though I do not know the way.\u2019\nElrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart\npierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. \u2018If I understand aright\nall that I have heard,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think that this task is appointed for\nyou, Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is\nthe hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to\nshake the towers and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise\ncould have foreseen it? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect\nto know it, until the hour has struck?\n\u2018But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on"}

It is hardly possible to separate you from\nhim, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.\u2019\nSam sat down, blushing and muttering. \u2018A nice pickle we have\nlanded ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he said, shaking his head."}

Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam\nhad crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo\u2019s com-\npanion.\n\u2018It\u2019s most unfair,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Instead of throwing him out, and\nclapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!\u2019\n\u2018Rewards!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine a more severe punishment.\nYou are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this\nhopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was\ndone, and I could rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t wonder,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018and I wish you could. But we are\nenvying Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment\nfor any of us to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a\nlong way with you and been through some stiff times. We want to\ngo on.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s what I meant,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018We hobbits ought to stick\ntogether, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There\nmust be someone with intelligence in the party.\u2019\n\u2018Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!\u2019 said\nGandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground.\n\u2018But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided\nyet.\u2019\n\u2018Nothing decided!\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018Then what were you all doing?\nYou were shut up for hours.\u2019\n\u2018Talking,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018There was a deal of talk, and everyone had\nan eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas\u2019s bit of news about\nGollum caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.\u2019\n\u2018You were wrong,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You were inattentive. I had\nalready heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real\neye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only\none that was not surprised.\u2019\n\u2018Well, anyway,\u2019 said Bilbo, \u2018nothing was decided beyond choosing\npoor Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to\nthat, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair\nnumber, when the reports come in.

We\nhope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a\nwhile less dangerous; but we must find out for certain. In the mean-\ntime you should try and forget your troubles, Frodo. I do not know\nif I can do anything to help you; but I will whisper this in your ears.\nSomeone said that intelligence would be needed in the party. He was\nright. I think I shall come with you.\u2019\nSo great was Frodo\u2019s delight at this announcement that Gandalf\nleft the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat\nand bowed. \u2018I only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything\nyet. In this matter Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the\nStrider. Which reminds me, I want to see Elrond. I must be off.\u2019\n\u2018How long do you think I shall have here?\u2019 said Frodo to Bilbo\nwhen Gandalf had gone.\n\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t count days in Rivendell,\u2019 said Bilbo.\n\u2018But quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What\nabout helping me with my book, and making a start on the next?\nHave you thought of an ending?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Oh,thatwon\u2019tdo!\u2019saidBilbo.\u2018Booksoughttohavegoodendings."}

That\u2019s what I often\nwonder.\u2019\nFor a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past\njourney and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of\nthe land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from\ntheir minds. The future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased\nto have any power over the present. Health and hope grew strong in\nthem, and they were content with each good day as it came, taking\npleasure in every meal, and in every word and song.\nSo the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and\nfair, and each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was\nwaning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale silver, and the\nlingering leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to blow chill\nfrom the Misty Mountains to the east. The Hunter\u2019s Moon waxed\nround in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But low\nin the South one star shone red. Every night, as the Moon waned\nagain, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it from his\nwindow, deep in the heavens, burning like a watchful eye that glared\nabove the trees on the brink of the valley.\nThe hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of Elrond,\nand November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and\nDecember was passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had\ngone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors;\nand others had gone west, and with the help of Aragorn and the\nRangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood, as far as\nTharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined\ntown. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed\nthe Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the\npass at the sources of the Gladden River, and had come down into\nWilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached\nthe old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and\nthey had returned over the high pass that was called the Redhorn\nGate. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, were the last to\nreturn; they had made a great journey, passing down the Silverlode\ninto a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak to\nany save to Elrond.\nIn no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings\nof the Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles\nof the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing"}

It seemed that they had vanished from the\nNorth.\n\u2018Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018It is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the\nRingwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best\nthey could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless.\n\u2018If that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt\nagain. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to\njourney all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick\nup our trail. And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we\nmust delay no longer.\u2019\nElrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo.\n\u2018The time has come,\u2019 he said. \u2018If the Ring is to set out, it must go\nsoon. But those who go with it must not count on their errand being\naided by war or force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy\nfar from aid. Do you still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be\nthe Ring-bearer?\u2019\n\u2018I do,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I will go with Sam.\u2019\n\u2018Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,\u2019 said\nElrond. \u2018I can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is\nto be achieved I do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet\nof the Mountains, and draws nigh even to the borders of the Grey-\nflood; and under the Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet many\nfoes, some open, and some disguised; and you may find friends upon\nyour way when you least look for it. I will send out messages, such\nas I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; but so\nperilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or\ncome no quicker than you yourself.\n\u2018And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as\nthey will or fortune allows. The number must be few, since your\nhope is in speed and secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of\nthe Elder Days, it would avail little, save to arouse the power of\nMordor.\n\u2018The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers\nshall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil.

It is true that if these hobbits\nunderstood the danger, they would not dare to go. But they would\nstill wish to go, or wish that they dared, and be shamed and un-\nhappy. I think, Elrond, that in this matter it would be well to trust\nrather to their friendship than to great wisdom. Even if you chose\nfor us an Elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he could not storm the\nDark Tower, nor open the road to the Fire by the power that is in\nhim.\u2019\n\u2018You speak gravely,\u2019 said Elrond, \u2018but I am in doubt. The Shire,\nI forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought\nto send back there as messengers, to do what they could, according\nto the fashion of their country, to warn the people of their danger.\nIn any case, I judge that the younger of these two, Peregrin Took,\nshould remain. My heart is against his going.\u2019\n\u2018Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send\nme home tied in a sack,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018For otherwise I shall follow\nthe Company.\u2019\n\u2018Let it be so then.

And Aragorn gave it a new\nname and called it Andu\u00b4ril, Flame of the West.\nAragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road\nand the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and\nfigured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond.\nSometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their\nguidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.\nIn those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the\nHall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the\nlay of Beren and Lu\u00b4thien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in\nthe day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and\nSam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room.

The\nothers could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness.\nSam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring\nmoodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his\ndesire for adventure was at its lowest ebb.\n\u2018Bill, my lad,\u2019 he said, \u2018you oughtn\u2019t to have took up with us. You\ncould have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.\u2019\nBill swished his tail and said nothing.\nSam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in\nhis mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had\nforgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little\nbox of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good\nsupply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I\u2019ll warrant); flint and\ntinder; woollen hose; linen; various small belongings of his master\u2019s\nthat Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in\ntriumph when they were called for. He went through them all.\n\u2018Rope!\u2019 he muttered. \u2018No rope! And only last night you said to\nyourself: \u2018\u2018Sam, what about a bit of rope?

For many sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains\nin the east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching\nfingers. Though the Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm,\neither moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during the middle of\nthe day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the tangled\nthorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late after-\nnoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold\nand cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a\nfire. In the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward\nas they could find a way.\nAt first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and\nstumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like\nsnails, and getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same\nas it had the day before. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing\nnearer. South of Rivendell they rose ever higher, and bent westwards;\nand about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider\nland of bleak hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths\nwere few and winding, and led them often only to the edge of some\nsheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.\nThey had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed.\nThe wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south. The\nswift-flowing clouds lifted and melted away, and the sun came out,\npale and bright. There came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long\nstumbling night-march. The travellers reached a low ridge crowned\nwith ancient holly-trees whose grey-green trunks seemed to have been\nbuilt out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark leaves shone and\ntheir berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun.\nAway in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty moun-\ntains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company\nwas taking. At the left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest\nand nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare,\nnorthern precipice was still largely in the shadow, but where the\nsunlight slanted upon it, it glowed red.\nGandalf stood at Frodo\u2019s side and looked out under his hand. \u2018We\nhave done well,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have reached the borders of the country\nthat Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when\nEregion was its name. Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we\nhave come, though many long miles further our feet have walked.\nThe land and the weather will be milder now, but perhaps all the\nmore dangerous.\u2019"}

There are\nmany maps in Elrond\u2019s house, but I suppose you never thought to\nlook at them?\u2019\n\u2018Yes I did, sometimes,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018but I don\u2019t remember them.\nFrodo has a better head for that sort of thing.\u2019\n\u2018I need no map,\u2019 said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and\nwas gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. \u2018There\nis the land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought\nthe image of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone,\nand into many songs and tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz,\nZirak, Shathu\u02c6r.\n\u2018Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but\nI know them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-du\u02c6 m, the\nDwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish\ntongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras;\nand beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White,\nand Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundushathu\u02c6r.\n\u2018There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies\nthe deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the\nDimrill Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.\u2019\n\u2018It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018If\nwe climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side\nof Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep\nvale of the Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River\nSilverlode rises in its icy springs.\u2019\n\u2018Dark is the water of Kheled-za\u02c6ram,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018and cold are the\nsprings of Kibil-na\u02c6la. My heart trembles at the thought that I may\nsee them soon.\u2019\n\u2018May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf !\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018But whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We\nmust go down the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the\nGreat River, and then\u2014\u2014\u2019\nHe paused.\n\u2018Yes, and where then?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018To the end of the journey \u2013 in the end,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We cannot\nlook too far ahead. Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over.\nI think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There\nis a wholesome air about Hollin.

{"308": "not now remember them. Only I hear the stones lament them: deep\nthey delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are\ngone. They are gone. They sought the Havens long ago.\u2019\nThat morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great\nbushes of holly, and their supper-breakfast was merrier than it had\nbeen since they set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for\nthey expected to have all the night to sleep in, and they did not mean\nto go on again until the evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was\nsilent and restless. After a while he left the Company and wandered\non to the ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out\nsouthwards and westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening.\nThen he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the\nothers laughing and talking.\n\u2018What is the matter, Strider?\u2019 Merry called up. \u2018What are you\nlooking for? Do you miss the East Wind?\u2019\n\u2018No indeed,\u2019 he answered. \u2018But I miss something. I have been in\nthe country of Hollin in many seasons.

There is no sound for miles\nabout us, and your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not\nunderstand it.\u2019\nGandalf looked up with sudden interest. \u2018But what do you guess\nis the reason?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Is there more in it than surprise at seeing\nfour hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so\nseldom seen or heard?\u2019\n\u2018I hope that is it,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018But I have a sense of watch-\nfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.\u2019\n\u2018Then we must be more careful,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018If you bring a\nRanger with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the\nRanger is Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set\nthe watch.\u2019\nIt was Sam\u2019s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn\njoined him. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even\nSam felt it. The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The\nswish of the pony\u2019s tail and the occasional movements of his feet\nbecame loud noises. Sam could hear his own joints creaking, if he\nstirred. Dead silence was around him, and over all hung a clear blue\nsky, as the Sun rode up from the East. Away in the South a dark\npatch appeared, and grew, and drove north like flying smoke in the\nwind."}

Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size. As\nthey passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their shadow followed\nthem darkly over the ground below, one harsh croak was heard.\nNot until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west,\nand the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up\nand went and wakened Gandalf.\n\u2018Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the\nMountains and the Greyflood,\u2019 he said, \u2018and they have passed over\nHollin. They are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn\nand Dunland. I do not know what they are about: possibly there is\nsome trouble away south from which they are fleeing; but I think\nthey are spying out the land. I have also glimpsed many hawks flying\nhigh up in the sky. I think we ought to move again this evening.\nHollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being watched.\u2019\n\u2018And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,\u2019 said Gandalf; \u2018and how\nwe can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we\nwill think of that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark,\nI am afraid that you are right.\u2019\n\u2018Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before\nthe crebain came,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018It must be put out and not lit again.\u2019\n\u2018Well if that isn\u2019t a plague and a nuisance!\u2019 said Pippin. The news:\nno fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon\nas he woke in the late afternoon. \u2018All because of a pack of crows!\nI had looked forward to a real good meal tonight: something hot.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you can go on looking forward,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018There may\nbe many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like\na pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain\nof one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south.\u2019\n\u2018Too warm, I shouldn\u2019t wonder,\u2019 muttered Sam to Frodo. \u2018But\nI\u2019m beginning to think it\u2019s time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain,\nand saw the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this\nhere Redhorn, or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke\nhis piece.

At dusk the Company set out, and turning\nnow half east they steered their course towards Caradhras, which far\naway still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished Sun.\nOne by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded.\nGuided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo\nlike the remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and\nwell planned, from Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at\nthe full, rose over the mountains, and cast a pale light in which the\nshadows of stones were black. Many of them looked to have been\nworked by hands, though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a\nbleak, barren land.\nIt was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the\nmoon was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt\na shadow pass over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and\nthen flashed out again. He shivered.\n\u2018Did you see anything pass over?\u2019 he whispered to Gandalf, who\nwas just ahead.\n\u2018No, but I felt it, whatever it was,\u2019 he answered. \u2018It may be nothing,\nonly a wisp of thin cloud.\u2019\n\u2018It was moving fast then,\u2019 muttered Aragorn, \u2018and not with the\nwind.\u2019\nNothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned\neven brighter than before. But the air was chill again; already the\nwind was turning back towards the east. For two more nights they\nmarched on, climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road\nwound up into the hills, and the mountains towered up, nearer and\nnearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose before them, a mighty\npeak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull\nred as if stained with blood.\nThere was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind\nhad gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and\nlooked back.\n\u2018Winter deepens behind us,\u2019 he said quietly to Aragorn. \u2018The\nheights away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down\ntheir shoulders.

{"311": "\u2018I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know\nwell, Gandalf,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018And perils known and unknown\nwill grow as we go on. But we must go on; and it is no good our\ndelaying the passage of the mountains. Further south there are no\npasses, till one comes to the Gap of Rohan. I do not trust that way\nsince your news of Saruman.

Not yet. Say nothing to the others,\nI beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.\u2019\n\u2018We must decide before we go further,\u2019 answered Gandalf.\n\u2018Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest\nand sleep,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nIn the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their break-\nfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at\nCaradhras. Its sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in\ngrey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which way the debate\nwould go. When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and\nthen he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the\nhigh pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was the other\ndark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill\nAragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been\nabandoned.\n\u2018From signs that we have seen lately,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018I fear that\nthe Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the\nweather that is coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go\nwith all the speed that we can. Even so it will take us more than two\nmarches before we reach the top of the pass. Dark will come early\nthis evening. We must leave as soon as you can get ready.\u2019\n\u2018I will add a word of advice, if I may,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018I was born\nunder the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of\njourneys in the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse,\nbefore we come down on the other side. It will not help us to keep\nso secret that we are frozen to death. When we leave here, where\nthere are still a few trees and bushes, each of us should carry a faggot\nof wood, as large as he can bear.\u2019\n\u2018And Bill could take a bit more, couldn\u2019t you, lad?\u2019 said Sam.

{"312": "The Company set out again, with good speed at first; but soon\ntheir way became steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing road\nhad in many places almost disappeared, and was blocked with many\nfallen stones. The night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter\nwind swirled among the rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the\nknees of the great mountains. The narrow path now wound under a\nsheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which the grim flanks of Caradhras\ntowered up invisible in the gloom; on the right was a gulf of darkness\nwhere the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine.\nLaboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment\nat the top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm\nand saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve.\nThey went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all\nthe air, and swirling into Frodo\u2019s eyes. The dark bent shapes of\nGandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.\n\u2018I don\u2019t like this at all,\u2019 panted Sam just behind. \u2018Snow\u2019s all right\non a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it\u2019s falling. I wish\nthis lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.\u2019\nExcept on the high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare\nin the Shire, and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for\nfun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter\nof 1311, when white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen\nBrandywine.\nGandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was\nalready ankle-deep about his boots.\n\u2018This is what I feared,\u2019 he said. \u2018What do you say now, Aragorn?\u2019\n\u2018That I feared it too,\u2019 Aragorn answered, \u2018but less than other\nthings. I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far\nsouth, save high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we\nare still far down, where the paths are usually open all the winter.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,\u2019 said Boromir.\n\u2018They say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains\nof Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange\npowers and many allies.\u2019\n\u2018His arm has grown long indeed,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018if he can draw snow\ndown from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.\u2019\n\u2018His arm has grown long,\u2019 said Gandalf.\nWhile they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slack-\nened until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they had\nnot gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh\nfury. The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard."}

They heard eerie noises in\nthe darkness round them. It may have been only a trick of the wind\nin the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those\nof shrill cries, and wild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from\nthe mountain-side, whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path\nbeside them. Every now and again they heard a dull rumble, as a\ngreat boulder rolled down from hidden heights above.\n\u2018We cannot go further tonight,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018Let those call it the\nwind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are\naimed at us.\u2019\n\u2018I do call it the wind,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But that does not make what\nyou say untrue.

Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves\nthe cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long\nhard slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones \u2013\nor anything else.\u2019\n\u2018And it is no good going back while the storm holds,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018We have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter\nthan this cliff-wall we are under now.\u2019\n\u2018Shelter!\u2019 muttered Sam. \u2018If this is shelter, then one wall and no\nroof make a house.\u2019\nThe Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they\ncould.

Doubtless we shall\nbe hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us,\nbut that will not help us.\u2019\n\u2018You may make a fire, if you can,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018If there are\nany watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire\nor no.\u2019\nBut though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice\nof Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame\nthat would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At\nlast reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he\nheld it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command, naur\nan edraith ammen! he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it.\nAt once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the\nwood flared and sputtered.\n\u2018If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from\nRivendell to the mouths of Anduin.\u2019"}
{"315": "burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools\nof slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the\nblaze. There they stood, stooping in a circle round the little dancing\nand blowing flames. A red light was on their tired and anxious faces;\nbehind them the night was like a black wall.\nBut the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.\nThe fire burned low, and the last faggot was thrown on.\n\u2018The night is getting old,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018The dawn is not far off.\u2019\n\u2018If any dawn can pierce these clouds,\u2019 said Gimli.\nBoromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness.\n\u2018The snow is growing less,\u2019 he said, \u2018and the wind is quieter.\u2019\nFrodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be\nrevealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a\nlong time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly,\nas sleep was beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that\nthe wind had indeed fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and\nfewer. Very slowly a dim light began to grow. At last the snow stopped\naltogether.\nAs the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world.\nBelow their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps\nbeneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost;\nbut the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with\nthe threat of snow.\nGimli looked up and shook his head. \u2018Caradhras has not forgiven\nus,\u2019 he said. \u2018He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The\nsooner we go back and down the better.\u2019\nTo this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well\nprove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the\nsnow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in\nplaces it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts\nagainst the cliff.\n\u2018If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt\na path for you,\u2019 said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and\nhe alone of the Company remained still light of heart.\n\u2018If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to\nsave us,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018But I must have something to work on.\nI cannot burn snow.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Boromir, \u2018when heads are at a loss bodies must serve,\nas we say in my country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See!\nThough all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about\nthat shoulder of rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first"}
{"316": "\u2018Then let us force a path thither, you and I!\u2019 said Aragorn.\nAragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less\nin height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and\nAragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling\nheavily. In places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir\nseemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than\nwalking.\nLegolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and\nthen he turned to the others. \u2018The strongest must seek a way, say\nyou? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for\nswimming, and for running light over grass and leaf, or over snow \u2013\nan Elf.\u2019\nWith that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if\nfor the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no\nboots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made\nlittle imprint in the snow.\n\u2018Farewell!\u2019 he said to Gandalf. \u2018I go to find the Sun!\u2019 Then swift\nas a runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the\ntoiling men, with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into\nthe distance, and vanished round the rocky turn.\nThe others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and\nAragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length they\ntoo passed from sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered,\nand now a few flakes of snow came curling down again.\nAn hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then\nat last they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir\nand Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came\nlabouring up the slope.\n\u2018Well,\u2019 cried Legolas as he ran up, \u2018I have not brought the Sun.\nShe is walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of\nsnow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have\nbrought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go\non feet. There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the turn,\nand there our Strong Men were almost buried. They despaired, until\nI returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall.\nAnd on the other side the snow suddenly grows less, while further\ndown it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit\u2019s toes.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, it is as I said,\u2019 growled Gimli. \u2018It was no ordinary storm. It\nis the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and\nthat drift was laid to cut off our escape.\u2019\n\u2018ButhappilyyourCaradhrashasforgottenthatyouhaveMenwith"}

Still, we have thrust a lane through the drift; and\nfor that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves.\u2019\n\u2018But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through\nthe drift?\u2019 said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.\n\u2018Have hope!\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018I am weary, but I still have some\nstrength left, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk. The others\nno doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master\nPeregrin! I will begin with you.\u2019\nHe lifted up the hobbit. \u2018Cling to my back! I shall need my arms,\u2019\nhe said and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin\nmarvelled at his strength, seeing the passage that he had already\nforced with no other tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened\nas he was, he was widening the track for those who followed, thrusting\nthe snow aside as he went.\nThey came at length to the great drift. It was flung across the\nmountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as\nif shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boro-\nmir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and\nfalling like a bridge. On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down,\nand there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to\narrive.\nAfter a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow\nbut now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli\nperched among the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo.\nThey passed through the lane; but hardly had Frodo touched the\nground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones\nand slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the Company as\nthey crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again they\nsaw that the path was blocked behind them.\n\u2018Enough, enough!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018We are departing as quickly as\nwe may!\u2019 And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain\nseemed to be expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders\nhad been beaten off and would not dare to return. The threat of\nsnow lifted; the clouds began to break and the light grew broader.\nAs Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily\nmore shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could\ntrudge along. Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the\nhead of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow\nthe night before.\nThe morning was now far advanced. From the high place they\nlooked back westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble\nof country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from"}

In the distance below him, but still high\nabove the lower foothills, dark dots were circling in the air.\n\u2018The birds again!\u2019 said Aragorn, pointing down.\n\u2018That cannot be helped now,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Whether they are\ngood or evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down\nat once. Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another\nnight-fall!\u2019\nA cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their\nbacks on the Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope.\nCaradhras had defeated them."}
{"319": "Chapter 4\nA JOURNEY IN THE DARK\nIt was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they\nhalted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were\nveiled in deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared\nthem one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell. When\nthey had eaten some food he called a council.\n\u2018We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,\u2019 he said. \u2018The attack\non the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a\nwhile.\u2019\n\u2018And then where are we to go?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018We still have our journey and our errand before us,\u2019 answered\nGandalf. \u2018We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.\u2019\nPippin\u2019s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to\nRivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and\nBoromir made no sign. Frodo looked troubled.\n\u2018I wish I was back there,\u2019 he said. \u2018But how can I return without\nshame \u2013 unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already\ndefeated?\u2019\n\u2018You are right, Frodo,\u2019 said Gandalf: \u2018to go back is to admit defeat,\nand face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring\nmust remain there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner\nor later Rivendell will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time\nit will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they\nare only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if\nthe Ruling Ring was on their master\u2019s hand again.\u2019\n\u2018Then we must go on, if there is a way,\u2019 said Frodo with a sigh.\nSam sank back into gloom.\n\u2018There is a way that we may attempt,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I thought\nfrom the beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we\nshould try it. But it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of\nit to the Company before. Aragorn was against it, until the pass over\nthe mountains had at least been tried.\u2019\n\u2018If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil\nindeed,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But you had better tell us about it, and let us\nknow the worst at once.\u2019\n\u2018The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,\u2019 said\nGandalf.OnlyGimlilifteduphishead;asmoulderingfirewasinhis"}
{"320": "\u2018The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will\nlead through Moria?\u2019 said Aragorn darkly.\n\u2018It is a name of ill omen,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018Nor do I see the need\nto go there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey south-\nwards, until we come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly\nto my people, taking the road that I followed on my way hither. Or\nwe might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin,\nand so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the sea.\u2019\n\u2018Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,\u2019 answered\nGandalf. \u2018Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him\nI may have business of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must\nnot come near Isengard, if that can by any means be prevented. The\nGap of Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer.\n\u2018As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might\nspend a year in such a journey, and we should pass through many\nlands that are empty and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe.\nThe watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on them.\nWhen you came north, Boromir, you were in the Enemy\u2019s eyes only\none stray wanderer from the South and a matter of small concern to\nhim: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But you return\nnow as a member of the Ring\u2019s Company, and you are in peril as\nlong as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every\nleague that we go south under the naked sky.\n\u2018Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has\nbecome more desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not\nsoon vanish from sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I\nadvise that we should go neither over the mountains, nor round them,\nbut under them. That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least\nexpect us to take.\u2019\n\u2018We do not know what he expects,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018He may watch\nall roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be\nto walk into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the\nDark Tower itself. The name of Moria is black.\u2019\n\u2018You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to\nthe stronghold of Sauron,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018I alone of you have\never been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older\nand lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of\nBarad-du\u02c6r do not return. But I would not lead you into Moria if\nthere were no hope of coming out again. If there are Orcs there, it\nmay prove ill for us, that is true.

But the question is:\nwho will follow me, if I lead you there?\u2019\n\u2018I will,\u2019 said Gimli eagerly.\n\u2018I will,\u2019 said Aragorn heavily. \u2018You followed my lead almost to\ndisaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow\nyour lead now \u2013 if this last warning does not move you. It is not of\nthe Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf.\nAnd I say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware!\u2019\n\u2018I will not go,\u2019 said Boromir; \u2018not unless the vote of the whole\nCompany is against me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The\nRing-bearer\u2019s voice surely should be heard?\u2019\n\u2018I do not wish to go to Moria,\u2019 said Legolas.\nThe hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo\nspoke. \u2018I do not wish to go,\u2019 he said; \u2018but neither do I wish to refuse\nthe advice of Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we\nhave slept on it. Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the\nmorning than in this cold gloom. How the wind howls!\u2019\nAt these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind\nhissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and\nwailing round them in the empty spaces of the night.\nSuddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. \u2018How the wind howls!\u2019 he\ncried. \u2018It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of\nthe Mountains!\u2019\n\u2018Need we wait until morning then?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It is as I said.\nThe hunt is up!

There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras\nthe Bullroarer in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don\u2019t ever\nremember feeling so wretched.\u2019\n\u2018My heart\u2019s right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But we\naren\u2019t etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever\nmay be in store for old Gandalf, I\u2019ll wager it isn\u2019t a wolf \u2019s belly.\u2019\nFor their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of\nthe small hill under which they had been sheltering. It was crowned\nwith a knot of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle\nof boulder-stones. In the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was\nno hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from dis-\ncovery by the hunting packs.\nRound the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed\nuneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood.\nThe howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer\nand sometimes further off. In the dead of night many shining eyes\nwere seen peering over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost\nto the ring of stones. At a gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape\ncould be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from\nhim, as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault.\nGandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft.\n\u2018Listen, Hound of Sauron!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Gandalf is here. Fly, if you\nvalue your foul skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come\nwithin this ring.\u2019\nThe wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At\nthat moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow.\nThere was a hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the\nground; the Elvish arrow had pierced its throat. The watching eyes\nwere suddenly extinguished. Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward,\nbut the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled. All about them\nthe darkness grew silent, and no cry came on the sighing wind."}
{"323": "from sleep. Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and\nwild all about the camp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently\nand was now attacking them from every side at once.\n\u2018Fling fuel on the fire!\u2019 cried Gandalf to the hobbits. \u2018Draw your\nblades, and stand back to back!\u2019\nIn the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many\ngrey shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed.\nThrough the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword\nwith a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another.\nBeside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-\naxe. The bow of Legolas was singing.\nIn the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he\nrose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient\nking of stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning\nbranch and strode to meet the wolves. They gave back before him.\nHigh in the air he tossed the blazing brand. It flared with a sudden\nwhite radiance like lightning; and his voice rolled like thunder.\n\u2018Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!\u2019 he cried.\nThere was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into\na leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to\ntree-top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords\nand knives of the defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of\nLegolas kindled in the air as it flew, and plunged burning into the\nheart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others fled.\nSlowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks;\na bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly\nfrom the hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their\nenemies were routed and did not return.\n\u2018What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin?\u2019 said Sam, sheathing his sword.\n\u2018Wolves won\u2019t get him.

As they stood\nupon the hillside, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the\nmountain-tops.\n\u2018We must reach the doors before sunset,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018or I fear\nwe shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be\nwinding, for here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in\nthis country, and only once have I been under the west wall of Moria,\nand that was long ago.\n\u2018There it lies,\u2019 he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where\nthe mountains\u2019 sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the\ndistance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst,\ntaller than the rest, one great grey wall. \u2018When we left the pass I led\nyou southwards, and not back to our starting point, as some of you\nmay have noticed. It is well that I did so, for now we have several\nmiles less to cross, and haste is needed. Let us go!\u2019\n\u2018I do not know which to hope,\u2019 said Boromir grimly: \u2018that Gandalf\nwill find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the\ngates lost for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between\nwolves and the wall the likeliest chance. Lead on!\u2019\nGimli now walked ahead by the wizard\u2019s side, so eager was he to\ncome to Moria. Together they led the Company back towards the\nmountains. The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain\nalong the course of a stream, the Sirannon, that ran out from the\nfeet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood. But either Gandalf\nwas astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did\nnot strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles\nsouthwards from their start.\nThe morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company\nwandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere\ncould they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was\nbleak and dry. Their hearts sank. They saw no living thing, and not\na bird was in the sky; but what the night would bring, if it caught\nthem in that lost land, none of them cared to think.\nSuddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them.\nHe was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying up\nthey saw below them a deep and narrow channel. It was empty and\nsilent, and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and\nred-stained stones of its bed; but on the near side there was a path,\nmuch broken and decayed, that wound its way among the ruined\nwalls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad."}
{"325": "happened to the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy.\nCome! We must hurry on. We are late.\u2019\nThe Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly\nalong the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned\nfrom the noon and began to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty\nmeal they went on again. Before them the mountains frowned, but\ntheir path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the\nhigher shoulders and the far eastward peaks.\nAt length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had\nbeen veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a\nsteep fall of the land to the left, turned and went due east again.\nRounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five\nfathoms high, with a broken and jagged top. Over it a trickling water\ndripped, through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out\nby a fall that had once been strong and full.\n\u2018Indeed things have changed!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But there is no mis-\ntaking the place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls. If I\nremember right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their\nside, but the main road wound away left and climbed with several\nloops up to the level ground at the top. There used to be a shallow\nvalley beyond the falls right up to the Walls of Moria, and the Siran-\nnon flowed through it with the road beside it. Let us go and see what\nthings are like now!\u2019\nThey found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang\nswiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached\nthe top they saw that they could go no further that way, and the\nreason for the drying up of the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind\nthem the sinking Sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering\ngold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset\nwas reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed\nand had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were reared\nvast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and impass-\nable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo\nsee in the frowning stone.\n\u2018There are the Walls of Moria,\u2019 said Gandalf, pointing across the\nwater. \u2018And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door\nat the end of the road from Hollin by which we have come. But this\nway is blocked. None of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim\nthis gloomy water at the end of the day. It has an unwholesome look.\u2019\n\u2018We must find a way round the northern edge,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018The\nfirst thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path"}
{"326": "\u2018But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,\u2019\nsaid Gandalf. \u2018The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there\nare places narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.\u2019\n\u2018Poor old Bill!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I had not thought of that. And poor\nSam! I wonder what he will say?\u2019\n\u2018I am sorry,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Poor Bill has been a useful companion,\nand it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled\nlighter and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond\nof, if I had had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged\nto take this road.\u2019\nThe day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in\nthe sky high above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed\nthey could, climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake.\nIn breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the\nwidest point. How far it stretched away southward they could not\nsee in the failing light; but its northern end was no more than half a\nmile from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that\nenclosed the valley and the water\u2019s edge there was a rim of open\nground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go\nbefore they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was\nmaking for; and then he had still to find the doors.\nWhen they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found\na narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant,\nthrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode\nforward undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more\nthan ankle-deep at the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading\ntheir way with care, for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy\nstones, and footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust\nat the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.\nAs Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground\non the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop,\nas if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly\nthey saw ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great\nrings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There\nwas a bubbling noise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the\nlast gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.\nGandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed\nas quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between\nthe lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards\nacross, and encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found\na way, hugging the cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as"}
{"327": "remains it seemed of old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined\nthe road across the drowned valley. But close under the cliff there\nstood, still strong and living, two tall trees, larger than any trees of\nholly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread\nfrom the wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked\nlike mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but\nnow they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep\nnight-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the\nend of the road.\n\u2018Well, here we are at last!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Here the Elven-way from\nHollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that land, and they\nplanted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West-door was\nmade chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those\nwere happier days, when there was still close friendship at times\nbetween folk of different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.\u2019\n\u2018It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,\u2019\nsaid Gimli.\n\u2018I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018I have heard both,\u2019 said Gandalf; \u2018and I will not give judgement\nnow. But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends,\nand to help me. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden,\nand the sooner we find them the better. Night is at hand!\u2019\nTurning to the others he said: \u2018While I am searching, will you\neach make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must say\nfarewell to our good beast of burden. You must lay aside much of\nthe stuff that we brought against bitter weather: you will not need it\ninside, nor, I hope, when we come through and journey on down\ninto the South. Instead each of us must take a share of what the pony\ncarried, especially the food and the water-skins.\u2019\n\u2018But you can\u2019t leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place,\nMr. Gandalf !\u2019 cried Sam, angry and distressed. \u2018I won\u2019t have it, and\nthat\u2019s flat. After he has come so far and all!\u2019\n\u2018I am sorry, Sam,\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018But when the Door opens I\ndo not think you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into the long\ndark of Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon\u2019s den, if I led him,\u2019 protested\nSam. \u2018It\u2019d be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these\nwolves about.\u2019\n\u2018It will be short of murder, I hope,\u2019 said Gandalf. He laid his hand\non the pony\u2019s head, and spoke in a low voice. \u2018Go with words of\nguard and guiding on you,\u2019 he said. \u2018You are a wise beast, and have\nlearnedmuchinRivendell.Makeyourwaystoplaceswhereyoucan"}
{"328": "\u2018There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves\nand getting home as we have.\u2019\nSam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill,\nseeming to understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him,\nputting his nose to Sam\u2019s ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled\nwith the straps, unlading all the pony\u2019s packs and throwing them on\nthe ground. The others sorted out the goods, making a pile of all\nthat could be left behind, and dividing up the rest.\nWhen this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared\nto have done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing\nat the blank wall of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with\nhis eyes. Gimli was wandering about, tapping the stone here and\nthere with his axe. Legolas was pressed against the rock, as if listening.\n\u2018Well, here we are and all ready,\u2019 said Merry; \u2018but where are the\nDoors? I can\u2019t see any sign of them.\u2019\n\u2018Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018They are invisible, and their own makers cannot find them or open\nthem, if their secret is forgotten.\u2019\n\u2018But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to\nDwarves,\u2019 said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round.\n\u2018Unless things are altogether changed, eyes that know what to look\nfor may discover the signs.\u2019\nHe walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the\ntrees there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to\nand fro, muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 he said. \u2018Can you see anything now?\u2019\nThe Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they\ncould see nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the surface, where\nthe wizard\u2019s hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins\nof silver running in the stone. At first they were no more than pale\ngossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the\nMoon caught them, but steadily they grew broader and clearer, until\ntheir design could be guessed.\nAt the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of inter-\nlacing letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were\nin places blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and\na hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these\nagain were two trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than\nall else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with\nmany rays.\n\u2018There are the emblems of Durin!\u2019 cried Gimli.\n\u2018And there is the Tree of the High Elves!\u2019 said Legolas."}

It is long since I heard them, and I thought deeply\nbefore I could recall them to my mind.\u2019\n\u2018What does the writing say?\u2019 asked Frodo, who was trying to\ndecipher the inscription on the arch. \u2018I thought I knew the elf-letters,\nbut I cannot read these.\u2019\n\u2018The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth\nin the Elder Days,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018But they do not say anything\nof importance to us. They say only: The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.\nSpeak, friend, and enter. And underneath small and faint is written:\nI, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.\u2019\n\u2018What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018That is plain enough,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018If you are a friend, speak the\npassword, and the doors will open, and you can enter.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018these doors are probably governed by words.\nSome dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular\npersons; and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all\nnecessary times and words are known. These doors have no key. In\nthe days of Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open and\ndoorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew the opening\nword could speak it and pass in. At least so it is recorded, is it not,\nGimli?\u2019\n\u2018It is,\u2019 said the dwarf. \u2018But what the word was is not remembered.\nNarvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.\u2019\n\u2018But do not you know the word, Gandalf ?\u2019 asked Boromir in surprise.\n\u2018No!\u2019 said the wizard.\nThe others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf\nwell, remained silent and unmoved.\n\u2018Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?\u2019 cried\nBoromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. \u2018You told\nus that you had once passed through the Mines. How could that be,\nif you did not know how to enter?\u2019\n\u2018The answer to your first question, Boromir,\u2019 said the wizard, \u2018is\nthat I do not know the word \u2013 yet. But we shall soon see. And,\u2019 he\nadded, with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, \u2018you may\nask what is the use of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for\nyour other question: do you doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left?\nI did not enter this way. I came from the East.\n\u2018If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards.\nFrom the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From\nthe outside nothing will move them save the spell of command. They\ncannot be forced inwards.\u2019"}
{"331": "\u2018Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018But if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace\nfrom foolish questions, I will seek for the opening words.\n\u2018I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or\nOrcs, that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember\nten score of them without searching in my mind. But only a few\ntrials, I think, will be needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli\nfor words of the secret dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The\nopening words were Elvish, like the writing on the arch: that seems\ncertain.\u2019\nHe stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff\nthe silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil.\nAnnon edhellen, edro hi ammen!\nFennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!\nhe said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank\ngrey stone did not stir.\nMany times he repeated these words in different order, or varied\nthem. Then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now\nfaster and louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single\nwords of Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered into\nthe night, the countless stars were kindled, the wind blew cold, and\nthe doors stood fast.\nAgain Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he\nspoke in tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and\nstruck the rock with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, and followed it\nwith the same command in every language that had ever been spoken\nin the West of Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground,\nand sat down in silence.\nAt that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears\nthe howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang\nto his side and whispered softly to him.\n\u2018Do not let him run away!\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018It seems that we shall\nneed him still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul\npool!\u2019 He stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the\ndark water.\nThe stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there\nwas a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface\nout beyond where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly\ntowards the foot of the cliff."}
{"332": "dark behind the doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool.\nDon\u2019t disturb it!\u2019\n\u2018I wish we could get away!\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018Why doesn\u2019t Gandalf do something quick?\u2019 said Pippin.\nGandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed,\neither in despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the\nwolves was heard again. The ripples on the water grew and came\ncloser; some were already lapping on the shore.\nWith a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his\nfeet. He was laughing! \u2018I have it!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Of course, of course!\nAbsurdly simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.\u2019\nPicking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear\nvoice: Mellon!\nThe star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great\ndoorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible\nbefore. Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by\ninch, until both doors lay back against the wall. Through the opening\na shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the\nlower steps the darkness was deeper than the night. The Company\nstared in wonder.\n\u2018I was wrong after all,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and Gimli too. Merry, of all\npeople, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on\nthe archway all the time! The translation should have been: Say\n\u2018\u2018Friend\u2019\u2019 and enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend\nand the doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-\nmaster in these suspicious days. Those were happier times. Now let\nus go!\u2019\nHe strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that\nmoment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him by\nthe ankle, and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of\nfear, and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the\ndarkness. Sam leaped after him, and then hearing Frodo\u2019s cry he ran\nback again, weeping and cursing. The others swung round and saw\nthe waters of the lake seething, as if a host of snakes were swimming\nup from the southern end.\nOut from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was\npale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of\nFrodo\u2019s foot, and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees\nwas now slashing at it with a knife.\nThe arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out\nfor help. Twenty other arms came rippling out. The dark water"}
{"333": "back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all\nbut Sam to the ground where they stood, he drove them forward.\nThey were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up,\nand Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles\nwrithed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the\ndoors. One came wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the star-\nlight. Gandalf turned and paused. If he was considering what word\nwould close the gate again from within, there was no need. Many\ncoiling arms seized the doors on either side, and with horrible\nstrength, swung them round. With a shattering echo they slammed,\nand all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came dully\nthrough the ponderous stone.\nSam, clinging to Frodo\u2019s arm, collapsed on a step in the black\ndarkness. \u2018Poor old Bill!\u2019 he said in a choking voice. \u2018Poor old Bill!\nWolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to\nchoose, Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.\u2019\nThey heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff\nagainst the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs\ntrembled, but the doors did not open.\n\u2018Well, well!\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018The passage is blocked behind us\nnow, and there is only one way out \u2013 on the other side of the moun-\ntains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and\nthe trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the\ntrees were beautiful, and had stood so long.\u2019\n\u2018I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my\nfoot first touched the water,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018What was the thing, or\nwere there many of them?\u2019\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 answered Gandalf; \u2018but the arms were all guided\nby one purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark\nwaters under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than\nOrcs in the deep places of the world.\u2019 He did not speak aloud his\nthought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on\nFrodo first among all the Company.\nBoromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magni-\nfied the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: \u2018In the deep\nplaces of the world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who\nwill lead us now in this deadly dark?\u2019\n\u2018I will,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and Gimli shall walk with me.

He had begun to\nshake off the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt\nextremely hungry.\nThe proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the\nupper steps, dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf\ngave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.\n\u2018It will not last much longer, I am afraid,\u2019 he said; \u2018but I think we\nneed it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck,\nwe shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully\nwith the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines,\nbut they should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling\nour skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.\u2019\n\u2018How long is that going to take us?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018I cannot say,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018It depends on many chances. But\ngoing straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or\nfour marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-\ndoor to East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.\u2019\nAfter only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were\neager to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing,\ntired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf\nwalked in front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering\nstaff, the light of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his\nright he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes\nglinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side.\nBehind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword,\nSting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring; and\nthat was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the\nElder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were\nnear at hand.

The air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at\ntimes they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from\nhalf-guessed openings in the walls. There were many of these. In the\npale ray of the wizard\u2019s staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and\narches, and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running"}
{"335": "Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At\nleast he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere\ndarkness in itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where\nthe choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had\nthe final word. The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the\nimagination of Gimli, Glo\u00b4in\u2019s son, dwarf of the mountain-race though\nhe was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were\nnow of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of\nthe road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as\nlong as there was a path that led towards his goal.\n\u2018Do not be afraid!\u2019 said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than\nusual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others\nwere crowded behind, waiting anxiously. \u2018Do not be afraid! I have\nbeen with him on many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there\nare tales in Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have\nseen. He will not go astray \u2013 if there is any path to find. He has led\nus in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever\ncost to himself. He is surer of finding the way home in a blind night\nthan the cats of Queen Beru\u00b4thiel.\u2019\nIt was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had\nno fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at\nthe doors many things had been left behind. But without any light\nthey would soon have come to grief. There were not only many roads\nto choose from, there were also in many places holes and pitfalls,\nand dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed.\nThere were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now\nand then a crack would open right before their feet. The widest was\nmore than seven feet across, and it was long before Pippin could\nsummon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap.

And\nhe was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain\nagainst his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt\nthe certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing.\nHe gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.\nThe Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried\nwhispers. There was no sound but the sound of their own feet: the\ndull stump of Gimli\u2019s dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light\nstep of Legolas; the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the\nrear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they\nhalted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasion-\nally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear,\nor to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft\nbare feet. It was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel\ncertain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while\nthe Company was moving. But it was not an echo, for when they halted\nit pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still.\nIt was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had\nbeen going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf\ncame to his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch\nopening into three passages: all led in the same general direction,\neastwards; but the left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-\nhand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on, smooth\nand level but very narrow.\n\u2018I have no memory of this place at all!\u2019 said Gandalf, standing\nuncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding\nsome marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of\nthe kind was to be seen. \u2018I am too weary to decide,\u2019 he said, shaking\nhis head. \u2018And I expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier.\nWe had better halt here for what is left of the night. You know what\nI mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding\nwestward and the middle-night has passed.\u2019\n\u2018Poor old Bill!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I wonder where he is. I hope those\nwolves haven\u2019t got him yet.\u2019\nTo the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half\nclosed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed\nto lie a wide chamber cut in the rock.\n\u2018Steady! Steady!\u2019 cried Gandalf, as Merry and Pippin pushed for-\nward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more\nfeeling of shelter than in the open passage. \u2018Steady! You do not know\nwhat is inside yet. I will go first.\u2019"}
{"337": "they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and\nrusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit.\nFragments of stone lay near.\n\u2018One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you\nwere going to strike the bottom,\u2019 said Aragorn to Merry. \u2018Let the\nguide go first while you have one.\u2019\n\u2018This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of\nthe three passages,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018That hole was plainly a well for the\nguards\u2019 use, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and we\nmust all take care in the dark.\u2019\nPippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were\nunrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber,\nas far as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and\npeered over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible\ndepths. Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and\nlet it drop. He felt his heart beat many times before there was any\nsound. Then far below, as if the stone had fallen into deep water in\nsome cavernous place, there came a plunk, very distant, but magnified\nand repeated in the hollow shaft.\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin con-\nfessed what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his\neye glinting. \u2018Fool of a Took!\u2019 he growled. \u2018This is a serious journey,\nnot a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and then\nyou will be no further nuisance. Now be quiet!\u2019\nNothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came\nout of the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and\nwhen the echoes had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap,\ntap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort;\nbut after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again.\n\u2018That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,\u2019\nsaid Gimli.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and I do not like it. It may have nothing to\ndo with Peregrin\u2019s foolish stone; but probably something has been\ndisturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of\nthe kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further\ntrouble. You, Pippin, can go on the first watch, as a reward,\u2019 he\ngrowled, as he rolled himself in a blanket.\nPippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on\nturning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out\nof the well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket,\nbut he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed\nto be asleep."}
{"338": "in the Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he\nshould take; a false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he\nrose up and came over to Pippin.\n\u2018Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,\u2019 he said in a kindly\ntone. \u2018You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as\nwell do the watching.\u2019\n\u2018I know what is the matter with me,\u2019 he muttered, as he sat down\nby the door. \u2018I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the morning\nbefore the snowstorm.\u2019\nThe last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark\nglimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing\nchip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment\nshowed his sharp nose, and the puff of smoke.\nIt was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and\nwatched all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest.\n\u2018And in the watches I have made up my mind,\u2019 he said. \u2018I do not\nlike the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the smell of the\nleft-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide. I shall\ntake the right-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up again.\u2019\nFor eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched\non; and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but\nthe faint gleam of the wizard\u2019s light, bobbing like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp in\nfront of them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards.\nAs far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as\nit rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no openings to\nother galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and\nsound, without pits or cracks. Evidently they had struck what once\nhad been an important road; and they went forward quicker than\nthey had done on their first march.\nIn this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct\nline east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or\nmore. As the road climbed upwards, Frodo\u2019s spirits rose a little; but\nhe still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard,\naway behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of their\nfeet, a following footstep that was not an echo.\nThey had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest,\nand all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly\nthe walls to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed\nthrough some arched doorway into a black and empty space. There\nwasagreatdraughtofwarmerairbehindthem,andbeforethemthe"}
{"339": "Gandalf seemed pleased. \u2018I chose the right way,\u2019 he said. \u2018At last\nwe are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far\nnow from the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher\nthan the Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the\nair we must be in a wide hall. I will now risk a little real light.\u2019\nHe raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was a blaze like a\nflash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second\nthey saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars\nhewn of stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty\nhall; its black walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered.\nThree other entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before\nthem eastwards, and one on either side. Then the light went out.\n\u2018That is all that I shall venture on for the present,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts\nleading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think\nwe have reached them now, but it is night outside again, and we\ncannot tell until morning. If I am right, tomorrow we may actually\nsee the morning peeping in. But in the meanwhile we had better go\nno further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, and\nthe greater part of the dark road is over. But we are not through yet,\nand it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world.\u2019\nThe Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled\nclose together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be\na steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about\nthem as they lay hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they\nwere oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and\nendlessly branching stairs and passages. The wildest imaginings that\ndark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short\nof the actual dread and wonder of Moria.\n\u2018There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one\ntime,\u2019 said Sam; \u2018and every one of them busier than badgers for five\nhundred years to make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did\nthey do it all for? They didn\u2019t live in these darksome holes surely?\u2019\n\u2018These are not holes,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018This is the great realm and city\nof the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light\nand splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.\u2019\nHe rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep\nvoice, while the echoes ran away into the roof.\nThe world was young, the mountains green,\nNo stain yet on the Moon was seen,"}
{"340": "He named the nameless hills and dells;\nHe drank from yet untasted wells;\nHe stooped and looked in Mirrormere,\nAnd saw a crown of stars appear,\nAs gems upon a silver thread,\nAbove the shadow of his head.\nThe world was fair, the mountains tall,\nIn Elder Days before the fall\nOf mighty kings in Nargothrond\nAnd Gondolin, who now beyond\nThe Western Seas have passed away:\nThe world was fair in Durin\u2019s Day.\nA king he was on carven throne\nIn many-pillared halls of stone\nWith golden roof and silver floor,\nAnd runes of power upon the door.\nThe light of sun and star and moon\nIn shining lamps of crystal hewn\nUndimmed by cloud or shade of night\nThere shone for ever fair and bright.\nThere hammer on the anvil smote,\nThere chisel clove, and graver wrote;\nThere forged was blade, and bound was hilt;\nThe delver mined, the mason built.\nThere beryl, pearl, and opal pale,\nAnd metal wrought like fishes\u2019 mail,\nBuckler and corslet, axe and sword,\nAnd shining spears were laid in hoard.\nUnwearied then were Durin\u2019s folk;\nBeneath the mountains music woke:\nThe harpers harped, the minstrels sang,\nAnd at the gates the trumpets rang.\nThe world is grey, the mountains old,\nThe forge\u2019s fire is ashen-cold;\nNo harp is wrung, no hammer falls:\nThe darkness dwells in Durin\u2019s halls;\nThe shadow lies upon his tomb"}
{"341": "But still the sunken stars appear\nIn dark and windless Mirrormere;\nThere lies his crown in water deep,\nTill Durin wakes again from sleep.\n\u2018I like that!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I should like to learn it. In Moria, in\nKhazad-du\u02c6m! But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all\nthose lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still?\u2019\nGimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.\n\u2018Piles of jewels?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018No. The Orcs have often plundered\nMoria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves\nfled, no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep\nplaces: they are drowned in water \u2013 or in a shadow of fear.\u2019\n\u2018Then what do the dwarves want to come back for?\u2019 asked Sam.\n\u2018For mithril,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018The wealth of Moria was not in\ngold and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant.\nSuch things they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did\nnot need to delve for them: all things that they desired they could\nobtain in traffic. For here alone in the world was found Moria-silver,\nor true-silver as some have called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The\nDwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times\nthat of gold, and now it is beyond price; for little is left above ground,\nand even the Orcs dare not delve here for it. The lodes lead away\nnorth towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The Dwarves tell\nno tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their wealth, so\nalso it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep,\nand disturbed that from which they fled, Durin\u2019s Bane. Of what they\nbrought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in\ntribute to Sauron, who covets it.\n\u2018Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and\npolished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light\nand yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of\ncommon silver, but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim.\nThe Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it\nithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet\nof mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become of\nit? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.\u2019\n\u2018What?\u2019 cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. \u2018A corslet of Moria-\nsilver? That was a kingly gift!\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I never told him, but its worth was greater\nthan the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.\u2019\nFrodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and"}
{"342": "Had Bilbo known? He felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It\nwas indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had been carried away\nfrom the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to Bilbo, and to Bag End in the\ndays while Bilbo was still there. He wished with all his heart that he\nwas back there, and in those days, mowing the lawn, or pottering\namong the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, or mithril\n\u2013 or the Ring.\nA deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was\non guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors\nout of deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and\nhis brow damp. He listened. All his mind was given to listening and\nnothing else for two slow hours; but he heard no sound, not even\nthe imagined echo of a footfall.\nHis watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that\nthe western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale\npoints of light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had\nnodded. \u2018I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard,\u2019 he thought. \u2018I\nwas on the edge of a dream.\u2019 He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and\nremained standing, peering into the dark, until he was relieved by\nLegolas.\nWhen he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him\nthat the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale\npoints of light approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the\nothers were speaking softly near him, and that a dim light was falling\non his face. High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near\nthe roof came a long pale gleam; and across the hall through the\nnorthern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly.\nFrodo sat up. \u2018Good morning!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018For morning it is\nagain at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side\nof Moria. Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and\nsee the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.\u2019\n\u2018I shall be glad,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018I have looked on Moria, and it is\nvery great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found\nno sign of my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.\u2019\nAfter they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once.\n\u2018We are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in\nMoria.\u2019\n\u2018No indeed!\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018Which way shall we take? Yonder\neastward arch?\u2019"}
{"343": "north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right\nroad down to them. The eastern arch will probably prove to be the\nway that we must take; but before we make up our minds we ought\nto look about us. Let us go towards that light in the north door. If\nwe could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes\nonly down deep shafts.\u2019\nFollowing his lead the Company passed under the northern arch.\nThey found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the\nglimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway\non their right. It was high and flat-topped, and the stone door was\nstill upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond it was a large square\nchamber. It was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after so long a time in\nthe dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as they entered.\nTheir feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled\namong things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at\nfirst make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further\neastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch\nof blue sky could be seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a\ntable in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about two\nfeet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.\n\u2018It looks like a tomb,\u2019 muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a\ncurious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came\nquickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:"}
{"344": "\u2018These are Daeron\u2019s Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,\u2019\nsaid Gandalf. \u2018Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:\nbalin son of fundin\nlord of moria.\u2019\n\u2018He is dead then,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I feared it was so.\u2019 Gimli cast his\nhood over his face."}
{"345": "Chapter 5\n\u02c6\nTHE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DUM\nThe Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin.\nFrodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and\nof Balin\u2019s visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the\nmountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of\nthe world.\nAt length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for\nanything that would give them tidings of Balin\u2019s fate, or show what\nhad become of his folk. There was another smaller door on the other\nside of the chamber, under the shaft. By both the doors they could\nnow see that many bones were lying, and among them were broken\nswords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and helms. Some of the\nswords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.\nThere were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them\nwere large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and\nplundered; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains\nof a book. It had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and\nit was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that\nlittle of it could be read. Gandalf lifted it carefully, but the leaves\ncracked and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for some\ntime without speaking. Frodo and Gimli standing at his side could\nsee, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they were written by many\ndifferent hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, and here and\nthere in Elvish script.\nAt last Gandalf looked up. \u2018It seems to be a record of the fortunes\nof Balin\u2019s folk,\u2019 he said. \u2018I guess that it began with their coming to\nDimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers\nreferring to the years after their arrival. The top page is marked one\n\u2013 three, so at least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this!\n\u2018We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard \u2013 I think; the next\nword is blurred and burned: probably room \u2013 we slew many in the\nbright \u2013 I think \u2013 sun in the dale. Flo\u00b4i was killed by an arrow. He slew\nthe great. Then there is a blur followed by Flo\u00b4i under grass near Mirror\nmere. The next line or two I cannot read.

{"346": "\u2018Well, I can read no more for a long way,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018except\nthe word gold, and Durin\u2019s Axe and something helm. Then Balin is\nnow lord of Moria. That seems to end a chapter. After some stars\nanother hand begins, and I can see we found truesilver, and later the\nword wellforged, and then something, I have it! mithril; and the last\ntwo lines O\u00b4 in to seek for the upper armouries of Third Deep, something\ngo westwards, a blur, to Hollin gate.\u2019\nGandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. \u2018There are several pages\nof the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged,\u2019 he said;\n\u2018but I can make little of them in this light. Now there must be a\nnumber of leaves missing, because they begin to be numbered five,\nthe fifth year of the colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too\ncut and stained; I cannot read them. We might do better in the\nsunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large bold hand using an Elvish\nscript.\u2019\n\u2018That would be Ori\u2019s hand,\u2019 said Gimli, looking over the wizard\u2019s\narm. \u2018He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish\ncharacters.\u2019\n\u2018I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless\nit ends in estre.

He went alone to\nlook in Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc,\nbut many more ... up from east up the Silverlode. The remainder of the\npage is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think\nI can read we have barred the gates, and then can hold them long if,\nand then perhaps horrible and suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have\nkept the title that he took for less than five years. I wonder what\nhappened afterwards; but there is no time to puzzle out the last few\npages. Here is the last page of all.\u2019 He paused and sighed.\n\u2018It is grim reading,\u2019 he said. \u2018I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We\ncannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second\nhall. Fra\u00b4r and Lo\u00b4ni and Na\u00b4li fell there. Then there are four lines\nsmeared so that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run\nthe pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took\nO\u00b4 in. We cannot get out. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the\ndeep. I wonder what that means.

There is nothing more.\u2019 Gandalf\npaused and stood in silent thought.\nA sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company.\n\u2018We cannot get out,\u2019 muttered Gimli. \u2018It was well for us that the pool"}

We will take this book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at\nit more closely later. You had better keep it, Gimli, and take it back\nto Da\u00b4in, if you get a chance.

Therefore we should leave by the\neastern arch of the hall, and bear right and south, and go downwards.\nThe Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh Level, that is six\nabove the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall!\u2019\nGandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great\nnoise: a rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below,\nand to tremble in the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the\ndoor in alarm. Doom, doom it rolled again, as if huge hands were\nturning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum. Then there came\nan echoing blast: a great horn was blown in the hall, and answering\nhorns and harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying\nsound of many feet.\n\u2018They are coming!\u2019 cried Legolas.\n\u2018We cannot get out,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Trapped!\u2019 cried Gandalf. \u2018Why did I delay?

We will see\nwhat\u2014\u2014\u2019\nDoom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook.\n\u2018Slam the doors and wedge them!\u2019 shouted Aragorn. \u2018And keep\nyour packs on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our\nway out yet.\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We must not get shut in. Keep the east door\najar! We will go that way, if we get a chance.\u2019\nAnother harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming\ndown the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the Company\ndrew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting\nglinted at the edges. Boromir set his shoulder against the western\ndoor."}
{"348": "\u2018Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria?\u2019 he\ncried in a loud voice.\nThere was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones\ninto a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command.\nDoom, boom, doom went the drums in the deep.\nWith a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow open-\ning of the door and thrust forward his staff. There was a dazzling\nflash that lit the chamber and the passage outside. For an instant the\nwizard looked out. Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor\nas he sprang back.\n\u2018There are Orcs, very many of them,\u2019 he said. \u2018And some are large\nand evil: black Uruks of Mordor.

Its key is gone and the lock is broken,\nand it opens inwards. We must do something to delay the enemy\nfirst. We will make them fear the Chamber of Mazarbul!\u2019 he said\ngrimly, feeling the edge of his sword, Andu\u00b4ril.\nHeavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself\nagainst the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken\nsword-blades and splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the\nother side of the chamber. But they had no chance to fly yet. There\nwas a blow on the door that made it quiver; and then it began to\ngrind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A huge arm and shoulder,\nwith a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust through the widening\ngap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced through below. There\nwas a dead silence outside.\nBoromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might;\nbut his sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand.\nThe blade was notched.\nSuddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze\nup in his heart. \u2018The Shire!\u2019 he cried, and springing beside Boromir,\nhe stooped, and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was\na bellow, and the foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from\nFrodo\u2019s arm. Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on"}
{"349": "\u2018One for the Shire!\u2019 cried Aragorn. \u2018The hobbit\u2019s bite is deep! You\nhave a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo!\u2019\nThere was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams\nand hammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered back,\nand the opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but\nstruck the northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was\na horn-blast and a rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped\ninto the chamber.\nHow many there were the Company could not count. The affray\nwas sharp, but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the\ndefence. Legolas shot two through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs\nfrom under another that had sprung up on Balin\u2019s tomb. Boromir and\nAragorn slew many. When thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking,\nleaving the defenders unharmed, except for Sam who had a scratch\nalong the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he had felled his\norc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was smouldering\nin his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step back-\nwards, if he had seen it.\n\u2018Now is the time!\u2019 cried Gandalf. \u2018Let us go, before the troll\nreturns!\u2019\nBut even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had\nreached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad\nin black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind\nhim his followers clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was\nswart, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a\ngreat spear. With a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromir\u2019s\nsword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving\nunder Aragorn\u2019s blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged\ninto the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The\nblow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the\nwall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it\nbroke. But even as the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out\nhis scimitar, Andu\u00b4ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash\nlike flame and the helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven\nhead. His followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at\nthem.\nDoom, doom went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled\nout again.\n\u2018Now!\u2019 shouted Gandalf. \u2018Now is the last chance. Run for it!\u2019\nAragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for\nthe stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others"}
{"350": "hauled the eastern door to, grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron\nrings on either side, but could not be fastened.\n\u2018I am all right,\u2019 gasped Frodo. \u2018I can walk. Put me down!\u2019\nAragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. \u2018I thought you\nwere dead!\u2019 he cried.\n\u2018Not yet!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But there is no time for wonder. Off you\ngo, all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the\nbottom, but if I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose\npaths leading right and downwards.\u2019\n\u2018We cannot leave you to hold the door alone!\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Do as I say!\u2019 said Gandalf fiercely. \u2018Swords are no more use here.\nGo!\u2019\nThe passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped\ntheir way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they\ncould see nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the\nwizard\u2019s staff. He seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed\ndoor. Frodo breathed heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his\narms about him. They stood peering up the stairs into the darkness.\nFrodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering\nwords that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could\nnot catch what was said. The walls seemed to be trembling. Every\nnow and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom, doom.\nSuddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light.\nThen there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats\nbroke out wildly: doom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. Gandalf\ncame flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the\nCompany.\n\u2018Well, well! That\u2019s over!\u2019 said the wizard struggling to his feet. \u2018I\nhave done all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly\nbeen destroyed. But don\u2019t stand here! Go on! You will have to do\nwithout light for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where\nare you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!\u2019\nThey stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom,\ndoom went the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far\naway, but they were following. There was no other sound of pursuit,\nneither tramp of feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or\nleft, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he\ndesired. Every now and again it descended a flight of steps, fifty or\nmore, to a lower level. At the moment that was their chief danger;\nfor in the dark they could not see a descent, until they came on it"}
{"351": "At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little\nmore, and had descended many flights of stairs. There was still no\nsound of pursuit. Almost they began to hope that they would escape.\nAt the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.\n\u2018It is getting hot!\u2019 he gasped. \u2018We ought to be down at least to the\nlevel of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand\nturn to take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest\nhere a moment, even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us.\u2019\nGimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step.\n\u2018What happened away up there at the door?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Did you meet\nthe beater of the drums?\u2019\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018But I found myself suddenly\nfaced by something that I have not met before. I could think of\nnothing to do but to try and put a shutting-spell on the door. I know\nmany; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time, and even\nthen the door can be broken by strength.\n\u2018As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any\nmoment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what\nwas said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language.\nAll I caught was gha\u02c6 sh: that is \u2018\u2018fire\u2019\u2019. Then something came into the\nchamber \u2013 I felt it through the door, and the orcs themselves were\nafraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived\nme and my spell.\n\u2018What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge.\nThe counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the\ndoor left my control and began to open! I had to speak a word of\nCommand. That proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces.\nSomething dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and\nI was thrown backwards down the stairs. All the wall gave way, and\nthe roof of the chamber as well, I think.\n\u2018I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is\nburied there too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind us\nwas completely blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is\npassing. And now what about you, Frodo? There was not time to\nsay so, but I have never been more delighted in my life than when\nyou spoke. I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that Aragorn\nwas carrying.\u2019\n\u2018What about me?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I am alive, and whole I think. I am\nbruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018I can only say that hobbits are made of a\nstuff so tough that I have never met the like of it.

{"352": "I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.\u2019 He\nsaid no more. He found breathing painful.\n\u2018You take after Bilbo,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018There is more about you\nthan meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.\u2019 Frodo wondered if\nthe remark meant more than it said.\nThey now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen\neyes in the dark. \u2018I think,\u2019 he said, \u2018that there is a light ahead. But it\nis not daylight. It is red. What can it be?\u2019\n\u2018Gha\u02c6sh!\u2019 muttered Gandalf. \u2018I wonder if that is what they meant:\nthat the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.\u2019\nSoon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It\nwas flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before\nthem. They could now see their way: in front the road sloped down\nswiftly, and some way ahead there stood a low archway; through it\nthe growing light came. The air became very hot.\nWhen they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to\nthem to wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face\nlit by a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.\n\u2018There is some new devilry here,\u2019 he said, \u2018devised for our welcome,\nno doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached the First\nDeep, the level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second\nHall of Old Moria; and the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern\nend, on the left, not more than a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge,\nup a broad stair, along a wide road, through the First Hall, and out!\nBut come and look!\u2019\nThey peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was\nloftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept. They\nwere near its eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down\nthe centre stalked a double line of towering pillars. They were carved\nlike boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branch-\ning tracery of stone. Their stems were smooth and black, but a red\nglow was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across the floor, close\nto the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out of it\na fierce red light came, and now and again flames licked at the brink\nand curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps of dark smoke\nwavered in the hot air.\n\u2018If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we\nshould have been trapped here,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Let us hope that the fire\nnow lies between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.\u2019\nEven as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom,\ndoom,doom.Awaybeyondtheshadowsatthewesternendofthehall"}
{"353": "\u2018Now for the last race!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018If the sun is shining outside,\nwe may still escape. After me!\u2019\nHe turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The\ndistance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the\nbeat and echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up:\nthey had been seen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow\nwhistled over Frodo\u2019s head.\nBoromir laughed. \u2018They did not expect this,\u2019 he said. \u2018The fire\nhas cut them off. We are on the wrong side!\u2019\n\u2018Look ahead!\u2019 called Gandalf. \u2018The Bridge is near. lt is dangerous\nand narrow.\u2019\nSuddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the\nhall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door\ncould only be reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or\nrail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It\nwas an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might\ncapture the First Hall and the outer passages. They could only pass\nacross it in single file. At the brink Gandalf halted and the others\ncame up in a pack behind.\n\u2018Lead the way, Gimli!\u2019 he said. \u2018Pippin and Merry next. Straight\non, and up the stair beyond the door!\u2019\nArrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back.\nAnother pierced Gandalf \u2019s hat and stuck there like a black feather.\nFrodo looked behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures:\nthere seemed to be hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears and\nscimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled\nthe drum-beats, growing louder and louder, doom, doom.\nLegolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long\nshot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow\nslipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great\ntrolls appeared; they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down\nto serve as gangways over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had\nfilled the Elf with terror. The ranks of the orcs had opened, and they\ncrowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was\ncoming up behind them. What it was could not be seen: it was like\na great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape\nmaybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and\nto go before it.\nIt came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud\nhad bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The\nflames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke\nswirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it."}
{"354": "\u2018Ai! ai!\u2019 wailed Legolas. \u2018A Balrog! A Balrog is come!\u2019\nGimli stared with wide eyes. \u2018Durin\u2019s Bane!\u2019 he cried, and letting\nhis axe fall he covered his face.\n\u2018A Balrog,\u2019 muttered Gandalf. \u2018Now I understand.\u2019 He faltered\nand leaned heavily on his staff. \u2018What an evil fortune! And I am\nalready weary.\u2019\nThe dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs\nyelled and poured over the stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his\nhorn and blew. Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout\nof many throats under the cavernous roof. For a moment the orcs\nquailed and the fiery shadow halted. Then the echoes died as sud-\ndenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind, and the enemy advanced\nagain.\n\u2018Over the bridge!\u2019 cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. \u2018Fly! This\nis a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly!\u2019 Aragorn\nand Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground,\nside by side, behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others\nhalted just within the doorway at the hall\u2019s end, and turned, unable\nto leave their leader to face the enemy alone.\nThe Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of\nthe span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand\nGlamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing\nhim, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It\nraised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from\nits nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.\n\u2018You cannot pass,\u2019 he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence\nfell. \u2018I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.\nYou cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udu\u02c6n.\nGo back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.\u2019\nThe Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the\ndarkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and sud-\ndenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread\nfrom wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the\ngloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a\nwizened tree before the onset of a storm.\nFrom out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.\nGlamdring glittered white in answer.\nThere was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell\nback, and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed\non the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.\n\u2018You cannot pass!\u2019 he said."}
{"355": "\u2018He cannot stand alone!\u2019 cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back\nalong the bridge. \u2018Elendil! \u2019 he shouted. \u2018I am with you, Gandalf !\u2019\n\u2018Gondor!\u2019 cried Boromir and leaped after him.\nAt that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote\nthe bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his\nhand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked.\nRight at the Balrog\u2019s feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood\ncrashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like\na tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.\nWith a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged\ndown and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the\nthongs lashed and curled about the wizard\u2019s knees, dragging him to\nthe brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid\ninto the abyss. \u2018Fly, you fools!\u2019 he cried, and was gone.\nThe fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood\nrooted with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir\ncame flying back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry\nAragorn roused them.\n\u2018Come! I will lead you now!\u2019 he called. \u2018We must obey his last\ncommand. Follow me!\u2019\nThey stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door, Aragorn\nleading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage.\nAlong this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then\nhe found that he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom\nthe drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now and slow; doom!\nThey ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the\nroof. They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight\nfrom its high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its\nhuge broken doors they passed, and suddenly before them the Great\nGates opened, an arch of blazing light.\nThere was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great\ndoor-posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and\ncast down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his\npath, and the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past\nthem and took no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang\ndown the huge and age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria.\nThus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the\nwind on their faces.\nThey did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls.\nDimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains\nlay upon it, but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It"}
{"356": "They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under\nthe mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow\ndrum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was\nto be seen; the dale all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly\novercame them, and they wept long: some standing and silent, some\ncast upon the ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded."}
{"357": "Chapter 6\nLOTHLO\u00b4\nRIEN\n\u2018Alas! I fear we cannot stay here longer,\u2019 said Aragorn. He looked\ntowards the mountains and held up his sword. \u2018Farewell, Gandalf !\u2019\nhe cried. \u2018Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware?\nAlas that I spoke true! What hope have we without you?\u2019\nHe turned to the Company. \u2018We must do without hope,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018At least we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no\nmore! Come! We have a long road, and much to do.\u2019\nThey rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up\ninto a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains,\nabove which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol,\nCaradhras, the Mountains of Moria. At the head of the glen a torrent\nflowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls, and a\nmist of foam hung in the air about the mountains\u2019 feet.\n\u2018Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,\u2019 said Aragorn, pointing to the falls.\n\u2018Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should\nhave come, if fortune had been kinder.\u2019\n\u2018Or Caradhras less cruel,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018There he stands smiling in\nthe sun!\u2019 He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks\nand turned away.\nTo the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a\nsudden end, and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and\nvague. To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far\nas sight could reach. Less than a mile away, and a little below them,\nfor they still stood high up on the west side of the dale, there lay a\nmere. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust\ndeep into the northern glen; but its southern end was beyond the\nshadows under the sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue\nlike clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still\nand unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all\nsides to its bare unbroken rim.\n\u2018There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-za\u02c6ram!\u2019 said Gimli sadly.\n\u2018I remember that he said: \u2018\u2018May you have joy of the sight! But we\ncannot linger there.\u2019\u2019 Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again.\nIt is I that must hasten away, and he that must remain.\u2019\nThe Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was"}
{"358": "that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the\nlowlands to the Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works\nof stone beside the path, and mounds of green topped with slender\nbirches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward bend led them\nhard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the roadside\nstood a single column broken at the top.\n\u2018That is Durin\u2019s Stone!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018I cannot pass without turning\naside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale!\u2019\n\u2018Be swift then!\u2019 said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates.\n\u2018The Sun sinks early. The Orcs will not, maybe, come out till after\ndusk, but we must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost\nspent, and it will be dark tonight.\u2019\n\u2018Come with me, Frodo!\u2019 cried the dwarf, springing from the road.\n\u2018I would not have you go without seeing Kheled-za\u02c6ram.\u2019 He ran down\nthe long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue\nwater in spite of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind.\nBeside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was\ncracked and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could\nnot be read. \u2018This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in\nthe Mirrormere,\u2019 said the dwarf. \u2018Let us look ourselves once, ere\nwe go!\u2019\nThey stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing.\nThen slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored\nin a profound blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame\nabove them; beyond there was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk\nin the deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight was in the sky above.\nOf their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen.\n\u2018O Kheled-za\u02c6ram fair and wonderful!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018There lies the\nCrown of Durin till he wakes. Farewell!\u2019 He bowed, and turned away,\nand hastened back up the greensward to the road again.\n\u2018What did you see?\u2019 said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in\nthought to answer.\nThe road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running\nout from between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere\nthey came on a deep well of water, clear as crystal, from which a\nfreshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a\nsteep rocky channel.\n\u2018Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Do not drink of it! It is icy cold.\u2019\n\u2018Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many\nother mountain-streams,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Our road leads beside it for"}
{"359": "Great River \u2013 out yonder.\u2019 They looked as he pointed, and before\nthem they could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the\nvalley, and then running on and away into the lower lands, until it\nwas lost in a golden haze.\n\u2018There lie the woods of Lothlo\u00b4 rien!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018That is the\nfairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the\ntrees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn\nto gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they\nfall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor\nof the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of\nsilver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs\nin Mirkwood say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves\nof that wood, and it were springtime!\u2019\n\u2018My heart will be glad, even in the winter,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But it\nlies many miles away. Let us hasten!\u2019\nFor some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the\nothers; but Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a\nwhile they lagged behind. They had eaten nothing since the early\nmorning. Sam\u2019s cut was burning like fire, and his head felt light. In\nspite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness\nof Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful and he\ngasped for breath.\nAt last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke\nto Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to\nBoromir to come with him.\n\u2018I am sorry, Frodo!\u2019 he cried, full of concern. \u2018So much has hap-\npened this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten\nthat you were hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have\ndone nothing to ease you, as we ought, though all the orcs of Moria\nwere after us. Come now! A little further on there is a place where\nwe can rest for a little. There I will do what I can for you. Come,\nBoromir! We will carry them.\u2019\nSoon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down\nfrom the west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying\nSilverlode. Together they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone,\nand foamed down into a dell. About it stood fir-trees, short and bent,\nand its sides were steep and clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of\nwhortle-berry. At the bottom there was a level space through which\nthe stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It\nwas now nearly three hours after noon, and they had come only a\nfew miles from the Gates. Already the sun was westering."}
{"360": "wound was not deep, but it looked ugly, and Aragorn\u2019s face was\ngrave as he examined it. After a moment he looked up with relief.\n\u2018Good luck, Sam!\u2019 he said. \u2018Many have received worse than this\nin payment for the slaying of their first orc. The cut is not poisoned,\nas the wounds of orc-blades too often are. It should heal well when\nI have tended it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.\u2019\nHe opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. \u2018They\nare dry, and some of their virtue has gone,\u2019 he said, \u2018but here I have\nstill some of the leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop.\nCrush one in the water, and wash the wound clean, and I will bind\nit. Now it is your turn, Frodo!\u2019\n\u2018I am all right,\u2019 said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched.\n\u2018All I needed was some food and a little rest.\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We must have a look and see what the hammer\nand the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at\nall.\u2019 Gently he stripped off Frodo\u2019s old jacket and worn tunic, and\ngave a gasp of wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shim-\nmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully\nhe took it off and held it up, and the gems on it glittered like stars,\nand the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a\npool.\n\u2018Look, my friends!\u2019 he called. \u2018Here\u2019s a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap\nan elven-princeling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides,\nall the hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.\u2019\n\u2018And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in\nvain,\u2019 said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. \u2018It is a mithril-coat.\nMithril! I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat\nthat Gandalf spoke of ? Then he undervalued it. But it was well\ngiven!\u2019\n\u2018I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close\nin his little room,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Bless the old hobbit! I love him more\nthan ever. I hope we get a chance of telling him about it!\u2019\nThere was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo\u2019s right side and\nbreast. Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one\npoint the rings had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo\u2019s left\nside also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against\nthe wall. While the others set the food ready, Aragorn bathed the\nhurts with water in which athelas was steeped. The pungent fragrance\nfilled the dell, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt\nrefreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and\nhis breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to the touch for\nmany days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side."}
{"361": "not lay it aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you\nare safe for a while; and that will seldom chance while your quest\nlasts.\u2019\nWhen they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put\nout the fire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell\nthey took to the road again. They had not gone far before the sun\nsank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the\nmountain-sides. Dusk veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows.\nAway in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of\ndistant plain and wood. Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly\nrefreshed were able to go at a fair pace, and with only one brief halt\nAragorn led the Company on for nearly three more hours.\nIt was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars,\nbut the fast-waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli and\nFrodo were at the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for\nany sound upon the road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence.\n\u2018Not a sound but the wind,\u2019 he said. \u2018There are no goblins near,\nor my ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Orcs will be\ncontent with driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their\npurpose, and they had nothing else to do with us \u2013 with the Ring.\nThough Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plain,\nif they have a fallen captain to avenge.\u2019\nFrodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull.\nYet he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the\nshadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim, he had\nheard again the quick patter of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned\nswiftly. There were two tiny gleams of light behind, or for a moment\nhe thought he saw them, but at once they slipped aside and vanished.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 said the dwarf.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018I thought I heard feet, and I\nthought I saw a light \u2013 like eyes. I have thought so often, since we\nfirst entered Moria.\u2019\nGimli halted and stooped to the ground. \u2018I hear nothing but the\nnight-speech of plant and stone,\u2019 he said. \u2018Come! Let us hurry! The\nothers are out of sight.\u2019\nThe night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them\na wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of\nleaves like poplars in the breeze.\n\u2018Lothlo\u00b4rien!\u2019 cried Legolas. \u2018Lothlo\u00b4rien! We have come to the eaves\nof the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter!\u2019"}
{"362": "In the dim light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering\nleaves a hint of fallow gold.\n\u2018Lothlo\u00b4rien!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Glad I am to hear again the wind in\nthe trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates,\nbut we can go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the\nElves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind.\u2019\n\u2018If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the\nland whence we wandered in ages long ago,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018but we\nhear that Lo\u00b4 rien is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here\nthat holds evil from the land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen,\nand maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the\nnorthern border.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,\u2019 said Aragorn, and sighed\nas if some memory stirred in him. \u2018We must fend for ourselves tonight.\nWe will go forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and\nthen we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.\u2019\nHe stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not\nfollow. \u2018Is there no other way?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018What other fairer way would you desire?\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,\u2019 said\nBoromir. \u2018By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far\nto evil fortune. Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria,\nto our loss. And now we must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But\nof that perilous land we have heard in Gondor, and it is said that\nfew come out who once go in; and of that few none have escaped\nunscathed.\u2019\n\u2018Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will\nspeak the truth,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir,\nif in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of\nLothlo\u00b4rien. Believe what you will, there is no other way for us \u2013 unless\nyou would go back to Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or\nswim the Great River all alone.\u2019\n\u2018Then lead on!\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018But it is perilous.\u2019\n\u2018Perilous indeed,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018fair and perilous; but only evil\nneed fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me!\u2019\nThey had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they\ncame upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad\nslopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains. They\nheard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right.\nIts dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them, and joined"}

Let us wade across!\nOn the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water\nmay bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.\u2019\nOne by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a\nmoment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his\ntired feet. It was cold but its touch was clean, and as he went on and\nit mounted to his knees, he felt that the stain of travel and all weariness\nwas washed from his limbs.\nWhen all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate\na little food; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlo\u00b4 rien that the Elves\nof Mirkwood still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon\nthe meadows by the Great River before the world was grey.\nAt length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall\nrunning sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could\nhear a voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water.\n\u2018Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel?\u2019 asked Legolas. \u2018I will sing\nyou a song of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the\nstream beside which she lived long ago. It is a fair song in our wood-\nland tongue; but this is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some\nin Rivendell now sing it.\u2019 In a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the\nrustle of the leaves above them he began:\nAn Elven-maid there was of old,\nA shining star by day:\nHer mantle white was hemmed with gold,\nHer shoes of silver-grey.\nA star was bound upon her brows,\nA light was on her hair\nAs sun upon the golden boughs\nIn Lo\u00b4rien the fair.\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white,\nAnd fair she was and free;\nAnd in the wind she went as light"}

{"365": "But from the West has come no word,\nAnd on the Hither Shore\nNo tidings Elven-folk have heard\nOf Amroth evermore.\nThe voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. \u2018I cannot sing\nany more,\u2019 he said. \u2018That is but a part, for I have forgotten much. It\nis long and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlo\u00b4 rien, Lo\u00b4 rien\nof the Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened evil in the mountains.\u2019\n\u2018But the Dwarves did not make the evil,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018I said not so; yet evil came,\u2019 answered Legolas sadly. \u2018Then many\nof the Elves of Nimrodel\u2019s kindred left their dwellings and departed,\nand she was lost far in the South, in the passes of the White Moun-\ntains; and she came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited\nfor her. But in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the\necho of her voice may still be heard by the falls that bear her name.\nAnd when the wind is in the South the voice of Amroth comes\nup from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, that Elves call\nCelebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great, and Anduin flows\ninto the Bay of Belfalas whence the Elves of Lo\u00b4 rien set sail. But\nneither Nimrodel nor Amroth came ever back.\n\u2018It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that\ngrew near the falls; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lo\u00b4 rien,\nto dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were\ncalled the Galadhrim, the Tree-people. Deep in their forest the trees\nare very great. The people of the woods did not delve in the ground\nlike Dwarves, nor build strong places of stone before the Shadow\ncame.\u2019\n\u2018And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be\nthought safer than sitting on the ground,\u2019 said Gimli. He looked\nacross the stream to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then\nup into the roof of dark boughs above.\n\u2018Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We cannot\nbuild a house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek\nrefuge in the tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road\nalready longer than was wise.\u2019\nThe Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the\nshadow of the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream\naway from Silverlode. Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found\na cluster of trees, some of which overhung the stream. Their great grey\ntrunks were of mighty girth, but their height could not be guessed."}

I will see now what\nis their shape and way of growth.\u2019\n\u2018Whatever it may be,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018they will be marvellous trees\nindeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot\nsleep on a perch!\u2019\n\u2018Then dig a hole in the ground,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018if that is more after\nthe fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you\nwish to hide from Orcs.\u2019 He sprang lightly up from the ground and\ncaught a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head. But\neven as he swung there for a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from\nthe tree-shadows above him.\n\u2018Daro!\u2019 it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to\nearth in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree.\n\u2018Stand still!\u2019 he whispered to the others. \u2018Do not move or speak!\u2019\nThere was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then\nanother clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand\nlittle of what was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of\nthe mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the West.\nLegolas looked up and answered in the same language.*\n\u2018Who are they, and what do they say?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018They\u2019re Elves,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Can\u2019t you hear their voices?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, they are Elves,\u2019 said Legolas; \u2018and they say that you breathe\nso loud that they could shoot you in the dark.\u2019 Sam hastily put his\nhand over his mouth. \u2018But they say also that you need have no fear.\nThey have been aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice\nacross the Nimrodel, and knew that I was one of their Northern\nkindred, and therefore they did not hinder our crossing; and after-\nwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo;\nfor they seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey.\nThe others they ask to wait a little, and to keep watch at the foot of\nthe tree, until they have decided what is to be done.\u2019\nOut of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope,\nsilver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender\nit proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up,\nand Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe\nloudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight\nfrom the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top the main\nstem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they\nfound that there had been built a wooden platform, or flet as such\nthings were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan. It was"}

They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could\nnot be seen among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They\nstood up, and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a\nslender silver beam. He held it up, looking at Frodo\u2019s face, and Sam\u2019s.\nThen he shut off the light again, and spoke words of welcome in his\nelven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.\n\u2018Welcome!\u2019 the Elf then said again in the Common Language,\nspeaking slowly. \u2018We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we\ndwell now in the heart of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings\nwith any other folk. Even our own kindred in the North are sundered\nfrom us. But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering\nof news and the watching of our enemies, and they speak the lan-\nguages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my name. My brothers,\nRu\u00b4mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue.\n\u2018But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers\nof Elrond passed by Lo\u00b4rien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair.\nWe had not heard of \u2013 hobbits, of halflings, for many a long year,\nand did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not\nlook evil! And since you come with an Elf of our kindred, we are\nwilling to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it is not our custom\nto lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here tonight.\nHow many are you?\u2019\n\u2018Eight,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of\nwhom, Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.\u2019\n\u2018The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lo\u00b4rien,\u2019 said\nHaldir, \u2018and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well. But you\nhave yet spoken only of seven.\u2019\n\u2018The eighth is a dwarf,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018A dwarf !\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018That is not well. We have not had dealings\nwith the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in\nour land. I cannot allow him to pass.\u2019\n\u2018But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Da\u00b4in\u2019s trusty people,\nand friendly to Elrond,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Elrond himself chose him to be\none of our companions, and he has been brave and faithful.\u2019\nThe Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas\nin their own tongue. \u2018Very good,\u2019 said Haldir at last. \u2018We will do\nthis, though it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard\nhim, and answer for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold\nthrough Lothlo\u00b4rien."}
{"368": "we saw a great troop of Orcs going north towards Moria, along the\nskirts of the mountains, many days ago. Wolves are howling on the\nwood\u2019s borders.

Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-\ncloaks of the Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to\ngo to sleep. But weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do.\nHobbits do not like heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when\nthey have any stairs. The flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom.\nIt had no walls, not even a rail; only on one side was there a light\nplaited screen, which could be moved and fixed in different places\naccording to the wind.\nPippin went on talking for a while. \u2018I hope, if I do go to sleep in\nthis bird-loft, that I shan\u2019t roll off,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Once I do get to sleep,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018I shall go on sleeping, whether\nI roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I\u2019ll drop off, if you take\nmy meaning.\u2019\nFrodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting\nthrough the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side\nlong before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey\nforms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their\nknees, speaking in whispers. The other had gone down to take up\nhis watch on one of the lower branches.

In spite of the\nfading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave\nFrodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and crawled to the opening\nand peered down. He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy\nmovements at the tree\u2019s foot far below.\nNot Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their\nmovements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing; and some-\nthing seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk.

Looking through an opening\non the south side of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode\nlying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze.\nThe morning was still young and cold when the Company set out\nagain, guided now by Haldir and his brother Ru\u00b4mil. \u2018Farewell, sweet\nNimrodel!\u2019 cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of\nwhite foam among the grey tree-stems. \u2018Farewell,\u2019 he said. It seemed\nto him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful,\nfor ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful music.\nThey went back to the path that still went on along the west side\nof the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There\nwere the prints of orc-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside\ninto the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows.\n\u2018There is one of my people yonder across the stream,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018though you may not see him.\u2019 He gave a call like the low whistle of\na bird, and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in\ngrey, but with his hood thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the\nmorning sun. Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope,\nand he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank.\n\u2018Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,\u2019 said Haldir,\n\u2018and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot\nin it so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness\nwe do not make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!\u2019 He made\nhis end of the rope fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along\nit, over the river and back again, as if he were on a road.\n\u2018I can walk this path,\u2019 said Legolas; \u2018but the others have not this\nskill. Must they swim?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018We have two more ropes. We will fasten them\nabove the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and hold-\ning these the strangers should be able to cross with care.\u2019\nWhen this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed\nover, some cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits\nPippin proved the best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over"}

Though he was thinking of gardening, not\nof roosting like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even\nmy uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!\u2019\nWhen at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank\nof the Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them.\nRu\u00b4mil, who had remained on the other side, drew back the last one,\nslung it on his shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away,\nback to Nimrodel to keep watch.\n\u2018Now, friends,\u2019 said Haldir, \u2018you have entered the Naith of Lo\u00b4rien,\nor the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a\nspearhead between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We\nallow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the Naith. Few indeed\nare permitted even to set foot there.\n\u2018As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf.\nThe others may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our\ndwellings, down in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.\u2019\nThis was not at all to the liking of Gimli. \u2018The agreement was\nmade without my consent,\u2019 he said. \u2018I will not walk blindfold, like a\nbeggar or a prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had\ndealings with any of the servants of the Enemy. Neither have we\ndone harm to the Elves. I am no more likely to betray you than\nLegolas, or any other of my companions.\u2019\n\u2018I do not doubt you,\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018Yet this is our law. I am not\nthe master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in\nletting you set foot over Celebrant.\u2019\nGimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his\nhand upon the haft of his axe. \u2018I will go forward free,\u2019 he said, \u2018or I\nwill go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of\nword, though I perish alone in the wilderness.\u2019\n\u2018You cannot go back,\u2019 said Haldir sternly. \u2018Now you have come\nthus far, you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They\nshall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You\ncannot cross the rivers again, and behind you there are now secret\nsentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw\nthem.\u2019\nGimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent\ntheir bows. \u2018A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks!\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Come!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018If I am still to lead this Company, you\nmust do as I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out."}
{"372": "Gimli laughed suddenly. \u2018A merry troop of fools we shall look!\nWill Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one\ndog? But I will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.\u2019\n\u2018I am an Elf and a kinsman here,\u2019 said Legolas, becoming angry\nin his turn.\n\u2018Now let us cry: \u2018\u2018a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!\u2019\u2019 \u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes,\nHaldir!\u2019\n\u2018I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do\nnot lead us well,\u2019 said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.\n\u2018You will have no claim,\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018I shall lead you well, and\nthe paths are smooth and straight.\u2019\n\u2018Alas for the folly of these days!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Here all are enemies\nof the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while the sun is merry\nin the woodland under leaves of gold!\u2019\n\u2018Folly it may seem,\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018Indeed in nothing is the power\nof the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that\ndivides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do\nwe find now in the world beyond Lothlo\u00b4rien, unless maybe in Riven-\ndell, that we dare not by our own trust endanger our land. We live\nnow upon an island amid many perils, and our hands are more often\nupon the bowstring than upon the harp.\n\u2018The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more;\nfor the Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak of\ndeparting, yet for that it already seems too late. The mountains to\nthe west are growing evil; to the east the lands are waste, and full of\nSauron\u2019s creatures; and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely\npass southward through Rohan, and the mouths of the Great River\nare watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come to the shores of\nthe Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. It is said that\nthere are still havens of the High Elves, but they are far north and\nwest, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be, though\nthe Lord and Lady may know, I do not.\u2019\n\u2018You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire, where Hobbits\nlive.\u2019\n\u2018Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea!\u2019 said\nHaldir. \u2018It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet\nstill we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.\u2019\n\u2018I cannot,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I have never seen them. I have never been\nout of my own land before.

Yet I do not believe that the world\nabout us will ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun\nas it was aforetime. For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a\ntruce, in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the\nMiddle-earth for ever. Alas for Lothlo\u00b4rien that I love! It would be a\npoor life in a land where no mallorn grew. But if there are mallorn-\ntrees beyond the Great Sea, none have reported it.\u2019\nAs they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in\nthe wood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind. They\nfelt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while\nthey walked more freely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived\nof sight, Frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened. He\ncould smell the trees and the trodden grass. He could hear many\ndifferent notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead, the river murmur-\ning away on his right, and the thin clear voices of birds high in the\nsky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed\nthrough an open glade.\nAs soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange\nfeeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into\nthe Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of\ntime into a corner of the Elder Days, and was now walking in a world\nthat was no more. In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things;\nin Lo\u00b4 rien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world. Evil\nhad been seen and heard there, sorrow had been known; the Elves\nfeared and distrusted the world outside: wolves were howling on the\nwood\u2019s borders: but on the land of Lo\u00b4 rien no shadow lay.\nAll that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool\nevening come and heard the early night-wind whispering among\nmany leaves. Then they rested and slept without fear upon the\nground; for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes,\nand they could not climb. In the morning they went on again, walking\nwithout haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo was aware that they\nhad passed out under the shining Sun.

They were standing in an open space. To the left\nstood a great mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as\nSpringtime in the Elder Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two\ncircles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were leafless\nbut beautiful in their shapely nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees\nof great height, still arrayed in pale gold. High amid the branches of\na towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white\nflet. At the feet of the trees, and all about the green hillsides the grass\nwas studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among\nthem, nodding on slender stalks, were other flowers, white and palest\ngreen: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass. Over\nall the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill\nand cast long green shadows beneath the trees.\n\u2018Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018For this\nis the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the\nmound of Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built.\nHere ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow\nelanor, and the pale niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and come to\nthe city of the Galadhrim at dusk.\u2019\nThe others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but\nFrodo stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had\nstepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A\nlight was upon it for which his language had no name. All that he\nsaw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they\nhad been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes,\nand ancient as if they had endured for ever.

I feel as if I was inside\na song, if you take my meaning.\u2019\nHaldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning\nof both thought and word. He smiled. \u2018You feel the power of the\nLady of the Galadhrim,\u2019 he said. \u2018Would it please you to climb with\nme up Cerin Amroth?\u2019\nThey followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes.\nThough he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and\nflowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo\nfelt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall\ninto forgetfulness. When he had gone and passed again into the outer\nworld, still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire would walk there,\nupon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair Lothlo\u00b4rien.\nThey entered the circle of white trees.

As\nFrodo prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside\nthe ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware\nof the feel and texture of a tree\u2019s skin and of the life within it. He\nfelt a delight in wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as\ncarpenter; it was the delight of the living tree itself.\nAs he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his\nhand and turned him towards the South. \u2018Look this way first!\u2019 he\nsaid.\nFrodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty\ntrees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell.

Not yet.\u2019 He turned\nand climbed swiftly down, and they followed him.\nAt the hill\u2019s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as\na tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a\nlight was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as\nFrodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had\nbeen in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the\nface of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall\nand fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo\ncould not see.

Their paths now\nwent into thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came\nbeneath the trees as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver\nlamps.\nSuddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves\nunder a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a\nwide treeless space before them, running in a great circle and bending\naway on either hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow,\nbut the grass upon its brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory\nof the sun that had gone. Upon the further side there rose to a great\nheight a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees\ntaller than any they had yet seen in all the land. Their height could\nnot be guessed, but they stood up in the twilight like living towers.\nIn their many-tiered branches and amid their ever-moving leaves\ncountless lights were gleaming, green and gold and silver. Haldir\nturned towards the Company.\n\u2018Welcome to Caras Galadhon!\u2019 he said. \u2018Here is the city of the\nGaladhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady\nof Lo\u00b4 rien.

They came at last to a white bridge, and crossing found the\ngreat gates of the city: they faced south-west, set between the ends\nof the encircling wall that here overlapped, and they were tall and\nstrong, and hung with many lamps.\nHaldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but\nof guards Frodo could see no sign.

It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the\nboughs of trees, and it fell into a basin of silver, from which a white\nstream spilled. Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the\nmightiest of all the trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk,\nand up it towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their\nhuge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves. Beside it a broad white\nladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang\nup as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they were tall\nand clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white\ncloaks.\n\u2018Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018It is their wish\nthat you should ascend and speak with them.\u2019\nOne of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn,\nand it was answered three times from far above. \u2018I will go first,\u2019 said\nHaldir. \u2018Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may\nfollow as they wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed\nto such stairs, but you may rest upon the way.\u2019\nAs he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one\nside, some on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so\nthat the ladder passed through them. At a great height above the\nground he came to a wide talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it\nwas built a house, so large that almost it would have served for a hall\nof Men upon the earth. He entered behind Haldir, and found that\nhe was in a chamber of oval shape, in the midst of which grew the\ntrunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, and yet\nmaking still a pillar of wide girth.\nThe chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and\nsilver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two\nchairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough\nthere sat, side by side, Celeborn and Galadriel.

If our folk\nhad been exiled long and far from Lothlo\u00b4 rien, who of the Galadhrim,\neven Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not wish to look\nupon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons?\n\u2018Dark is the water of Kheled-za\u02c6ram, and cold are the springs of\nKibil-na\u02c6la, and fair were the many-pillared halls of Khazad-du\u02c6m in\nElder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.\u2019 She\nlooked upon Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And\nthe Dwarf, hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue, looked\nup and met her eyes; and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly\ninto the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding.\nWonder came into his face, and then he smiled in answer.\nHe rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: \u2018Yet more\nfair is the living land of Lo\u00b4 rien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all\nthe jewels that lie beneath the earth!\u2019\nThere was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. \u2018I did not\nknow that your plight was so evil,\u2019 he said. \u2018Let Gimli forget my\nharsh words: I spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can\nto aid you, each according to his wish and need, but especially that"}
{"381": "we will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove,\nmaybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself\nplainly purposed. For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the\nwisest of the Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the\npower of kings. He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn,\nand I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of\nNargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and together\nthrough ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.\n\u2018I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs\nhad not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the\nGrey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even\nnow there is hope left. I will not give you counsel, saying do this, or\ndo that. For not in doing or contriving, nor in choosing between this\ncourse and another, can I avail; but only in knowing what was and is,\nand in part also what shall be. But this I will say to you: your Quest\nstands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the\nruin of all. Yet hope remains while all the Company is true.\u2019\nAnd with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence\nlooked searchingly at each of them in turn.

Even if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have\nrefuge in this City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you\nshall rest, and we will not speak of your further road for a while.\u2019\nThat night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the\nsatisfaction of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion\namong the trees near the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches;\nthen speaking words of peace with fair Elvish voices they left them.\nFor a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the\ntree-tops, and of their day\u2019s journey, and of the Lord and Lady; for\nthey had not yet the heart to look further back.\n\u2018What did you blush for, Sam?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018You soon broke\ndown.

Legolas\nwas away much among the Galadhrim, and after the first night he\ndid not sleep with the other companions, though he returned to eat\nand talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he went\nabroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change.\nNow as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of\nGandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear\nbefore their minds.

But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not\ninterpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that\nfor him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for\nsong.\nIt was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting\nwords.

What you will see,\nif you leave the Mirror free to work, I cannot tell. For it shows things\nthat were, and things that are, and things that yet may be. But which\nit is that he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell.

Like a dream the vision shifted and went back, and\nhe saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and he\ncould see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they\nwere falling, crashing to the ground.\n\u2018Hi!\u2019 cried Sam in an outraged voice. \u2018There\u2019s that Ted Sandyman\na-cutting down trees as he shouldn\u2019t.

The mist cleared and he saw a sight which\nhe had never seen before but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell.\nThe sea rose and raged in a great storm. Then he saw against the\nSun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of clouds, the black outline of\na tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West. Then a wide\nriver flowing through a populous city. Then a white fortress with\nseven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now it was\nmorning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing\nthe emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and\nbattle arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded\ninto a grey mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling\nwith lights. It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.\nBut suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole\nhad opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness.\nIn the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until\nit filled nearly all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood\nrooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was\nrimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat\u2019s, watchful\nand intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window\ninto nothing.\nThen the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and\nFrodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things\nthat it sought he himself was one.

I am permitted to wear\nthe One Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts\nof those that wear them?\u2019\n\u2018You have not tried,\u2019 she said. \u2018Only thrice have you set the Ring\nupon your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It\nwould destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power\naccording to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use\nthat power you would need to become far stronger, and to train your\nwill to the domination of others. Yet even so, as Ring-bearer and as\none that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your\nsight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought more clearly\nthan many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that\nholds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize\nthe ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring?\u2019 she asked turning\nagain to Sam.\n\u2018No, Lady,\u2019 he answered. \u2018To tell you the truth, I wondered what\nyou were talking about. I saw a star through your fingers. But if you\u2019ll\npardon my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you\u2019d\ntake his Ring. You\u2019d put things to rights. You\u2019d stop them digging\nup the Gaffer and turning him adrift. You\u2019d make some folk pay for\ntheir dirty work.\u2019\n\u2018I would,\u2019 she said. \u2018That is how it would begin. But it would not\nstop with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!\u2019"}
{"391": "Chapter 8\nLO\u00b4\nFAREWELL TO RIEN\nThat night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of\nCeleborn, and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words.\nAt length Celeborn spoke of their departure.\n\u2018Now is the time,\u2019 he said, \u2018when those who wish to continue the\nQuest must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no\nlonger wish to go forward may remain here, for a while. But whether\nthey stay or go, none can be sure of peace. For we are come now\nto the edge of doom. Here those who wish may await the oncoming\nof the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again, or we\nsummon them to the last need of Lo\u00b4rien. Then they may return to\ntheir own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in\nbattle.\u2019\nThere was a silence. \u2018They all resolved to go forward,\u2019 said Galadriel\nlooking in their eyes.\n\u2018As for me,\u2019 said Boromir, \u2018my way home lies onward and not\nback.\u2019\n\u2018That is true,\u2019 said Celeborn, \u2018but is all this Company going with\nyou to Minas Tirith?\u2019\n\u2018We have not decided our course,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Beyond Lothlo\u00b4r-\nien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not\nthink that even he had any clear purpose.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe not,\u2019 said Celeborn, \u2018yet when you leave this land, you\ncan no longer forget the Great River. As some of you know well, it\ncannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lo\u00b4 rien and\nGondor, save by boat. And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken\ndown and all the landings held now by the Enemy?\n\u2018On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon\nthis side, upon the west; but the straight road of the Quest lies east of\nthe River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take?\u2019\n\u2018If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way\nto Minas Tirith,\u2019 answered Boromir. \u2018But I am not the leader of the\nCompany.\u2019 The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful\nand troubled.\n\u2018I see that you do not yet know what to do,\u2019 said Celeborn. \u2018It is\nnot my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may.

{"392": "\u2018And one Hobbit!\u2019 cried Merry. \u2018Not all of us look on boats as\nwild horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.\u2019\n\u2018That is well,\u2019 said Celeborn. \u2018Then I will furnish your Company\nwith boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water,\nthere are places where you will be forced to carry them. You will\ncome to the rapids of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls\nof Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and\nthere are other perils. Boats may make your journey less toilsome for\na while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave\nthem and the River, and turn west \u2013 or east.\u2019\nAragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats com-\nforted him much, not least because there would now be no need to\ndecide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more hope-\nful. Whatever perils lay ahead, it seemed better to float down the\nbroad tide of Anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent\nbacks. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still thought boats as\nbad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that he had\nsurvived made him think better of them.\n\u2018All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before\nnoon tomorrow,\u2019 said Celeborn. \u2018I will send my people to you in the\nmorning to help you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish\nyou all a fair night and untroubled sleep.\u2019\n\u2018Good night, my friends!\u2019 said Galadriel. \u2018Sleep in peace! Do not\ntrouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight.\nMaybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before\nyour feet, though you do not see them. Good night!\u2019\nThe Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion.\nLegolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Loth-\nlo\u00b4 rien, and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take\ncounsel together.\nFor a long time they debated what they should do, and how it\nwould be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring;\nbut they came to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired\nto go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from\nthe terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a\nleader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo\nspoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind.\nHis own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go\nwith Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor.

{"393": "forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir.\nAnd yet what help could he or any of the Company give to Frodo,\nsave to walk blindly with him into the darkness?\n\u2018I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,\u2019\nsaid Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his\neyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling\u2019s thoughts.\nAt length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself.\n\u2018If you wish only to destroy the Ring,\u2019 he said, \u2018then there is little\nuse in war and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help.\nBut if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then\nit is folly to go without force into his domain; and folly to throw\naway.\u2019 He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he was\nspeaking his thoughts aloud. \u2018It would be folly to throw lives away,\nI mean,\u2019 he ended. \u2018It is a choice between defending a strong place\nand walking openly into the arms of death. At least, that is how I\nsee it.\u2019\nFrodo caught something new and strange in Boromir\u2019s glance,\nand he looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir\u2019s thought was different\nfrom his final words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The\nRing of Power? He had said something like this at the Council, but\nthen he had accepted the correction of Elrond. Frodo looked at\nAragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign\nthat he had heeded Boromir\u2019s words. And so their debate ended.\nMerry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The\nnight was growing old.\nIn the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods,\nElves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them\nmany gifts of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly\nin the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light\nbrown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli\ntook up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.\n\u2018Cram,\u2019 he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner\nand nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the\nrest of the cake with relish.\n\u2018No more, no more!\u2019 cried the Elves laughing. \u2018You have eaten\nenough already for a long day\u2019s march.\u2019\n\u2018I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dale-men make\nfor journeys in the wild,\u2019 said the Dwarf.\n\u2018So it is,\u2019 they answered. \u2018But we call it lembas or waybread, and\nit is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more\npleasant than cram, by all accounts.\u2019"}
{"394": "best bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out\ntheir cakes to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts!\u2019\n\u2018All the same, we bid you spare the food,\u2019 they said. \u2018Eat little at\na time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you\nwhen all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days,\nif they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have\nbrought them. One will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long\nlabour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith.\u2019\nThe Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the\nclothes they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and\ncloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff\nthat the Galadhrim wove. It was hard to say of what colour they\nwere: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to\nbe; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green\nas shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as\nwater under the stars. Each cloak was fastened about the neck with\na brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.\n\u2018Are these magic cloaks?\u2019 asked Pippin, looking at them with\nwonder.\n\u2018I do not know what you mean by that,\u2019 answered the leader of\nthe Elves. \u2018They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was\nmade in this land. They are Elvish robes certainly, if that is what you\nmean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the hue and\nbeauty of all these things under the twilight of Lo\u00b4 rien that we love;\nfor we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make. Yet\nthey are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade.\nBut they should serve you well: they are light to wear, and warm\nenough or cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid\nin keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk\namong the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of\nthe Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never\nbefore have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.\u2019\nAfter their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn\nby the fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and\nit had become like home to them, though they could not count the\ndays and nights that they had passed there. As they stood for a\nmoment looking at the white water in the sunlight, Haldir came\nwalking towards them over the green grass of the glade. Frodo greeted\nhim with delight.\n\u2018I have returned from the Northern Fences,\u2019 said the Elf, \u2018and I\nam sent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full of"}
{"395": "returning northwards to your homes, you would not have been able\nto pass that way. But come! Your path now goes south.\u2019\nAs they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were\nempty; but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring\nand singing. They themselves went silently. At last Haldir led them\ndown the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again to the\ngreat gate hung with lamps, and to the white bridge; and so they\npassed out and left the city of the Elves. Then they turned away from\nthe paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of\nmallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling woodlands of\nsilver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and eastwards,\ntowards the shores of the River.\nThey had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they\ncame on a high green wall. Passing through an opening they came\nsuddenly out of the trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining\ngrass, studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn\nran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right\nand west the Silverlode flowed glittering; on the left and east the\nGreat River rolled its broad waters, deep and dark. On the further\nshores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as eye could\nsee, but all the banks were bleak and bare. No mallorn lifted its\ngold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lo\u00b4rien.\nOn the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meet-\ning of the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white\nwood. By it were moored many boats and barges. Some were brightly\npainted, and shone with silver and gold and green, but most were\neither white or grey. Three small grey boats had been made ready\nfor the travellers, and in these the Elves stowed their goods. And\nthey added also coils of rope, three to each boat. Slender they looked,\nbut strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the elven-cloaks.\n\u2018What are these?\u2019 asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the\ngreensward.\n\u2018Ropes indeed!\u2019 answered an Elf from the boats. \u2018Never travel far\nwithout a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such are\nthese. They may be a help in many needs.\u2019\n\u2018You don\u2019t need to tell me that!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I came without any,\nand I\u2019ve been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these\nwere made of, knowing a bit about rope-making: it\u2019s in the family as\nyou might say.\u2019\n\u2018They are made of hithlain,\u2019 said the Elf, \u2018but there is no time now\nto instruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this\ncraft delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas!"}
{"396": "\u2018Come!\u2019 said Haldir. \u2018All is now ready for you. Enter the boats!\nBut take care at first!\u2019\n\u2018Heed the words!\u2019 said the other Elves. \u2018These boats are light-built,\nand they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not\nsink, lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It\nwould be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out,\nhere where there is a landing-place, before you set off downstream.\u2019\nThe Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam\nwere in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the\nthird were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In\nthis last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats\nwere moved and steered with short-handled paddles that had broad\nleaf-shaped blades. When all was ready Aragorn led them on a trial\nup the Silverlode. The current was swift and they went forward\nslowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and looking back\nwistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water dazzled\nhis eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the\ntrees drew down to the river\u2019s brink. Here and there golden leaves\ntossed and floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright\nand still, and there was a silence, except for the high distant song of\nlarks.\nThey turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly\ndown the stream towards them, they saw a swan of great size. The\nwater rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving\nneck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet\nset in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music\ncame down the river as it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived\nthat it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness\nof a bird. Two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles. In\nthe midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind him stood Galadriel,\ntall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her\nhand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the sound\nof her voice in the cool clear air:\nI sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:\nOf wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.\nBeyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,\nAnd by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.\nBeneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,\nIn Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.\nThere long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching"}
{"397": "O Lo\u00b4rien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;\nThe leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.\nO Lo\u00b4rien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore\nAnd in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.\nBut if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,\nWhat ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?\nAragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The\nLady ended her song and greeted them. \u2018We have come to bid our\nlast farewell,\u2019 she said, \u2018and to speed you with blessings from our\nland.\u2019\n\u2018Though you have been our guests,\u2019 said Celeborn, \u2018you have not\nyet eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here\nbetween the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lo\u00b4 rien.\u2019\nThe Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their\nboats and followed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon the\ngreen grass the parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little,\nheeding only the beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no\nlonger perilous or terrible, nor filled with hidden power. Already she\nseemed to him, as by men of later days Elves still at times are seen:\npresent and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been\nleft far behind by the flowing streams of Time.\nAfter they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn\nspoke to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed\nsouth to the woods beyond the Tongue.\n\u2018As you go down the water,\u2019 he said, \u2018you will find that the trees\nwill fail, and you will come to a barren country. There the River\nflows in stony vales amid high moors, until at last after many leagues\nit comes to the tall island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir.\nThere it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and falls\nthen with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down\ninto the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue. That is\na wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and\nmuch divided. There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from\nthe Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this side\nof the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills\nof the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they\nlook out over the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith\nGorgor and the black gates of Mordor.\n\u2018Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do\nwell to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash"}

But Boromir and Aragorn\ndoubtless do not need this warning.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,\u2019 said Boromir.\n\u2018But what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives\u2019\ntales, such as we tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is\nnow to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there. Of old\nFangorn lay upon the borders of our realm; but it is now many lives\nof men since any of us visited it, to prove or disprove the legends\nthat have come down from distant years.\n\u2018I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed\nit northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through\nthe Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen\nand the Greyflood into Northerland. A long and wearisome journey.\nFour hundred leagues I reckoned it, and it took me many months;\nfor I lost my horse at Tharbad, at the fording of the Greyflood. After\nthat journey, and the road I have trodden with this Company, I do\nnot much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan, and Fangorn\ntoo, if need be.\u2019\n\u2018Then I need say no more,\u2019 said Celeborn. \u2018But do not despise\nthe lore that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance\nthat old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful\nfor the wise to know.\u2019\nNow Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of\nher maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn.\n\u2018Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,\u2019 she said. \u2018Drink, Lord\nof the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad, though night must\nfollow noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.\u2019\nThen she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade\nthem drink and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded\nthem to sit again on the grass, and chairs were set for her and for\nCeleborn. Her maidens stood silent about her, and a while she looked\nupon her guests. At last she spoke again.\n\u2018We have drunk the cup of parting,\u2019 she said, \u2018and the shadows\nfall between us.

Yet it is not yours to\ngive me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come\nto it.\u2019\n\u2018Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,\u2019 said Galadriel; \u2018for it was\nleft in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.\u2019\nThen she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a\nsilver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with out-\nspread wings; and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun\nshining through the leaves of spring. \u2018This stone I gave to Celebr\u00b4\u0131an\nmy daughter, and she to hers; and now it comes to you as a token\nof hope. In this hour take the name that was foretold for you, Elessar,\nthe Elfstone of the House of Elendil!\u2019\nThen Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast,\nand those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how\ntall and kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil\nhad fallen from his shoulders. \u2018For the gifts that you have given me I\nthank you,\u2019 he said, \u2018O Lady of Lo\u00b4rien of whom were sprung Celebr\u00b4\u0131an\nand Arwen Evenstar. What praise could I say more?\u2019\nThe Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and\nto him she gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave\nsmall silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To\nLegolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used, longer and\nstouter than the bows of Mirkwood, and strung with a string of\nelf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows.\n\u2018For you little gardener and lover of trees,\u2019 she said to Sam, \u2018I\nhave only a small gift.\u2019 She put into his hand a little box of plain grey\nwood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. \u2018Here is\nset G for Galadriel,\u2019 she said; \u2018but also it may stand for garden in\nyour tongue. In this box there is earth from my orchard, and such\nblessing as Galadriel has still to bestow is upon it. It will not keep\nyou on your road, nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep\nit and see your home again at last, then perhaps it may reward you.\nThough you should find all barren and laid waste, there will be few\ngardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you\nsprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, and\ncatch a glimpse far off of Lo\u00b4rien, that you have seen only in our\nwinter. For our Spring and our Summer are gone by, and they will\nnever be seen on earth again save in memory.\u2019"}
{"400": "\u2018And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?\u2019 said Galadriel,\nturning to Gimli.\n\u2018None, Lady,\u2019 answered Gimli. \u2018It is enough for me to have seen\nthe Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.\u2019\n\u2018Hear all ye Elves!\u2019 she cried to those about her. \u2018Let none say\nagain that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious!

I do not\nask for such a gift. But you commanded me to name my desire.\u2019\nThe Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn\ngazed at the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. \u2018It is said that\nthe skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues,\u2019\nshe said; \u2018yet that is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to\nme a request so bold and yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse,\nsince I commanded him to speak? But tell me, what would you do\nwith such a gift?\u2019\n\u2018Treasure it, Lady,\u2019 he answered, \u2018in memory of your words to me\nat our first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home,\nit shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house,\nand a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until\nthe end of days.\u2019\nThen the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three\ngolden hairs, and laid them in Gimli\u2019s hand. \u2018These words shall go\nwith the gift,\u2019 she said. \u2018I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now\nvain: on the one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But\nif hope should not fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Glo\u00b4 in, that\nyour hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold shall have no\ndominion.\n\u2018And you, Ring-bearer,\u2019 she said, turning to Frodo. \u2018I come to you\nlast who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.\u2019\nShe held up a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and\nrays of white light sprang from her hand. \u2018In this phial,\u2019 she said, \u2018is\ncaught the light of Ea\u00a8rendil\u2019s star, set amid the waters of my fountain.\nIt will shine still brighter when night is about you. May it be a light\nto you in dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember\nGaladriel and her Mirror!\u2019\nFrodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them,\nhe saw her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no"}
{"401": "Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe.\nA yellow noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water\nglittered with silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took\ntheir places in the boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lo\u00b4 rien\nwith long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream, and\nthe rippling waters bore them slowly away. The travellers sat still\nwithout moving or speaking. On the green bank near to the very\npoint of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and silent. As\nthey passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating\naway from them. For so it seemed to them: Lo\u00b4 rien was slipping\nbackward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on\nto forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the\ngrey and leafless world.\nEven as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of\nthe Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed south-\nward. Soon the white form of the Lady was small and distant. She\nshone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or\nas a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of\nthe land. Then it seemed to Frodo that she lifted her arms in a final\nfarewell, and far but piercing-clear on the following wind came the\nsound of her voice singing. But now she sang in the ancient tongue\nof the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not understand the words:\nfair was the music, but it did not comfort him.\nYet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his\nmemory, and long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could:\nthe language was that of Elven-song and spoke of things little known\non Middle-earth.\nAi! laurie\u00a8 lantar lassi su\u00b4rinen,\nye\u00b4ni u\u00b4no\u00b4time\u00a8 ve ra\u00b4mar aldaron!\nYe\u00b4ni ve linte\u00a8 yuldar ava\u00b4nier\nmi oromardi lisse-miruvo\u00b4reva\nAndu\u00b4ne\u00a8 pella, Vardo tellumar\nnu luini yassen tintilar i eleni\no\u00b4maryo aireta\u00b4ri-l\u00b4\u0131rinen.\nS\u00b4\u0131 man i yulma nin enquantuva?\nAn s\u00b4\u0131 Tintalle\u00a8 Varda Oiolosse\u00a8o\nve fanyar ma\u00b4ryat Elenta\u00b4ri ortane\u00a8,\nar ilye\u00a8 tier undula\u00b4ve\u00a8 lumbule\u00a8;\nar sindano\u00b4riello caita mornie\u00a8\ni falmalinnar imbe\u00a8 met, ar h\u00b4\u0131sie\u00a8"}

Who now shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler,\nVarda, the Queen of the Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted\nher hands like clouds, and all paths are drowned deep in shadow;\nand out of a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between\nus, and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever.

Farewell!\u2019 Varda is the name\nof that Lady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth.\nSuddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon\neither side, and the light of Lo\u00b4rien was hidden. To that fair land\nFrodo never came again.\nThe travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was\nbefore them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears.\nGimli wept openly.\n\u2018I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,\u2019 he said to\nLegolas his companion. \u2018Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless\nit be her gift.\u2019 He put his hand to his breast.\n\u2018Tell me, Legolas, why did I come on this Quest? Little did I know\nwhere the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could\nnot foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark\nwas the danger that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I\nwould not have come, had I known the danger of light and joy. Now\nI have taken my worst wound in this parting, even if I were to go\nthis night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for Gimli son of Glo\u00b4 in!\u2019\n\u2018Nay!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world\nin these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it\nseems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you\nblessed, Gimli son of Glo\u00b4 in: for your loss you suffer of your own free\nwill, and you might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken\nyour companions, and the least reward that you shall have is that the\nmemory of Lothlo\u00b4 rien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your\nheart, and shall neither fade nor grow stale.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Gimli; \u2018and I thank you for your words.

{"403": "I have heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world\nthan to a dream. Not so for Dwarves.\n\u2018But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in\nthe water with all this baggage, and the Great River is swift. I do not\nwish to drown my grief in cold water.\u2019 He took up a paddle, and\nsteered towards the western bank, following Aragorn\u2019s boat ahead,\nwhich had already moved out of the middle stream.\nSo the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying\nwaters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank,\nand they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze\ndied away and the River flowed without a sound. No voice of bird\nbroke the silence. The sun grew misty as the day grew old, until it\ngleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl. Then it faded into the\nWest, and dusk came early, followed by a grey and starless night.\nFar into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding their boats\nunder the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees\npassed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through\nthe mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and\nlistened to the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the\ntree-roots and driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and\nhe fell into an uneasy sleep."}
{"404": "Chapter 9\nTHE GREAT RIVER\nFrodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped,\nunder tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on\nthe west bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night\naway, and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches.\nGimli was busy with a small fire near at hand.\nThey started again before the day was broad. Not that most of\nthe Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that\nthe decision, which they must make at latest when they came to\nRauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let\nthe River bear them on at its own pace, having no desire to hasten\ntowards the perils that lay beyond, whichever course they took in the\nend. Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished, hus-\nbanding their strength against weariness to come. But he insisted\nthat at least they should start early each day and journey on far into\nthe evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, and he\nfeared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in\nLo\u00b4 rien.\nNonetheless they saw no sign of any enemy that day, nor the next.\nThe dull grey hours passed without event. As the third day of their\nvoyage wore on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then\nfailed altogether. On the eastern bank to their left they saw long\nformless slopes stretching up and away towards the sky; brown and\nwithered they looked, as if fire had passed over them, leaving no\nliving blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree\nor a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. They had come to the Brown\nLands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern Mirkwood and\nthe hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed of\nthe Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.\nUpon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was\nflat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. On this side\nof the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut\nout all view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along\ntheir fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed\nin the light cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through\nopenings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and\nfar beyond them hills in the sunset, and away on the edge of sight"}
{"405": "There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these\nthere were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but\nthey were seldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the rush\nand whine of swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx\nstreaming along the sky.\n\u2018Swans!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And mighty big ones too!\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018and they are black swans.\u2019\n\u2018How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks!\u2019 said\nFrodo. \u2018I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer\nand merrier, until winter was left behind for ever.\u2019\n\u2018But we have not journeyed far south yet,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018It\nis still winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world is cold\nuntil the sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far away\ndown in the Bay of Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and\nmerry, maybe, or would be but for the Enemy. But here we are not\nabove sixty leagues, I guess, south of the Southfarthing away in your\nShire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are looking now south-\nwest across the north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the land of\nthe Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight\nthat runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the\nnorth boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight\nand the White Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and\npleasant land, and its grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk\ndo not dwell by the River or ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide,\nyet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream; and of late,\nit is said, they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and\nstuds of Rohan.\u2019\nSam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed\nhostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers;\nnow he wished that the trees were still there. He felt that the Company\nwas too naked, afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless\nlands, and on a river that was the frontier of war.\nIn the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards,\nthis feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company. For a whole day\nthey took to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by.\nSoon the River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches\nlay upon the east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that\ncareful steering was needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds,\nover which flowed a chill air from the East. On the other side the\nmeads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of\nfen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of the lawns and fountains,\nthe clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlo\u00b4rien. There was little speech"}
{"406": "The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer\nnight in some northern glade amid the beech-woods; Gimli was\nfingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought\ninto the housing of the Lady\u2019s gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle\nboat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes\nbiting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, some-\ntimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn\u2019s.\nThen Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam\nin his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago\nmade up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous\nas he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfort-\nable than even he had imagined. He was cramped and miserable,\nhaving nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands crawling by and\nthe grey water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in\nuse they did not trust Sam with one.\nAs dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over\nthe bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he\nwas drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes.\nSuddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at it listlessly,\nthen he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he\ncould not see it any more.\nThat night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank.\nSam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. \u2018I had a funny dream an\nhour or two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 he said. \u2018Or maybe it\nwasn\u2019t a dream. Funny it was anyway.\u2019\n\u2018Well, what was it?\u2019 said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle\ndown until he had told his tale, whatever it was. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen or\nthought of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlo\u00b4 rien.\u2019\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if\nit wasn\u2019t a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a\nlog with eyes!\u2019\n\u2018The log\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018There are many in the River.\nBut leave out the eyes!\u2019\n\u2018That I won\u2019t,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018\u2019Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so\nto speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light\nbehind Gimli\u2019s boat; but I didn\u2019t give much heed to it. Then it\nseemed as if the log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar,\nas you might say, seeing as we were all floating on the stream together.\nJust then I saw the eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a\nhump at the near end of the log. What\u2019s more, it wasn\u2019t a log, for it\nhad paddle-feet, like a swan\u2019s almost, only they seemed bigger, and"}

But whether those two lamps spotted me moving\nand staring, or whether I came to my senses, I don\u2019t know. When I\nlooked again, it wasn\u2019t there. Yet I think I caught a glimpse, with\nthe tail of my eye, as the saying is, of something dark shooting under\nthe shadow of the bank. I couldn\u2019t see no more eyes, though.\n\u2018I said to myself: \u2018\u2018dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,\u2019\u2019 I said; and I\nsaid no more just then. But I\u2019ve been thinking since, and now I\u2019m\nnot so sure. What do you make of it, Mr. Frodo?\u2019\n\u2018I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in\nyour eyes, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018if this was the first time that those eyes\nhad been seen. But it isn\u2019t. I saw them away back north before we\nreached Lo\u00b4 rien. And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to\nthe flet that night. Haldir saw it too. And do you remember the report\nof the Elves that went after the orc-band?\u2019\n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018I do; and I remember more too. I don\u2019t like my\nthoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo\u2019s\nstories and all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess.\nA nasty name. Gollum, maybe?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Ever\nsince the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and\npicked up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lo\u00b4 rien would\nthrow him off the scent again. The miserable creature must have\nbeen hiding in the woods by the Silverlode, watching us start off !\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s about it,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And we\u2019d better be a bit more watchful\nourselves, or we\u2019ll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of\nthese nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that\u2019s what I\nwas leading up to. No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight.\nI\u2019ll keep watch. I can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage\nin a boat, as you might say.\u2019\n\u2018I might,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018and I might say \u2018\u2018luggage with eyes\u2019\u2019. You\nshall watch; but only if you promise to wake me half-way towards\nmorning, if nothing happens before then.\u2019\nIn the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find\nSam shaking him. \u2018It\u2019s a shame to wake you,\u2019 whispered Sam, \u2018but\nthat\u2019s what you said. There\u2019s nothing to tell, or not much. I thought\nI heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but\nyou hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night.\u2019\nHe lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and\nfought off his sleep. Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing"}

A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot\nout and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly\nas they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on\nthe eyot. They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo\nheard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting\nfrom its sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut\noff. There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot\naway downstream into the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned\nover, and sat up.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. \u2018I\nfelt something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword?\u2019\n\u2018Gollum,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018Or at least, so I guess.\u2019\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018So you know about our little footpad, do you?\nHe padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel.\nSince we took to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with\nhands and feet. I have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but\nhe is slier than a fox, and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage\nwould beat him, but he is too clever a waterman.\n\u2018We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now,\nand I will keep watch for what is left of the night. I wish I could lay\nmy hands on the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot,\nwe shall have to try and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart\nfrom murder by night on his own account, he may put any enemy\nthat is about on our track.\u2019\nThe night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow\nagain. After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw\nno more of Gollum while the voyage lasted. If he was still following,\nhe was very wary and cunning. At Aragorn\u2019s bidding they paddled\nnow for long spells, and the banks went swiftly by. But they saw little\nof the country, for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting\nby day, and lying as hidden as the land allowed. In this way the time\npassed without event until the seventh day.\nThe weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East,\nbut as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and\npools of faint light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey\nshores of cloud. There the white rind of the new Moon could be\nseen glimmering in the remote lakes. Sam looked at it and puckered\nhis brows.\nThe next day the country on either side began to change rapidly.\nThe banks began to rise and grow stony.

They were drawing\nnear to the grey hill-country of the Emyn Muil, the southern march\nof Wilderland.\nThere were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys,\nand all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black\nagainst the pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn\nwatched the flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing\nsome mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the\nwilderness. Later as the sun was setting, and the Company was stir-\nring and getting ready to start again, he descried a dark spot against\nthe fading light: a great bird high and far off, now wheeling, now\nflying on slowly southwards.\n\u2018What is that, Legolas?\u2019 he asked, pointing to the northern sky. \u2018Is\nit, as I think, an eagle?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what\nthat forebodes. It is far from the mountains.\u2019\n\u2018We will not start until it is fully dark,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nThe eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless;\nthe grey east wind had passed away. The thin crescent of the Moon\nhad fallen early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and\nthough far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that\nstill shone faintly, in the West stars glinted bright.\n\u2018Come!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We will venture one more journey by night.\nWe are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well; for\nI have never journeyed by water in these parts before, not between\nhere and the rapids of Sarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning,\nthose are still many miles ahead. Still there are dangerous places even\nbefore we come there: rocks and stony eyots in the stream. We must\nkeep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly.\u2019\nTo Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He\nlay forward peering into the gloom. The night grew dark, but the\nstars above were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer on the\nface of the River. It was close on midnight, and they had been drifting\nfor some while, hardly using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried\nout. Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream\nand he heard the swirl of racing water. There was a swift current\nwhich swung left, towards the eastern shore where the channel was\nclear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now very\nclose, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were\nthrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth.

Turn if you can!\u2019 He drove\nhis paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round.\n\u2018I am out of my reckoning,\u2019 he said to Frodo. \u2018I did not know that\nwe had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir\nmust be close at hand already.\u2019\nWith great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them\nabout; but at first they could make only small headway against the\ncurrent, and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the\neastern bank. Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night.\n\u2018All together, paddle!\u2019 shouted Boromir. \u2018Paddle! Or we shall be\ndriven on the shoals.\u2019 Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath\nhim grate upon stone.\nAt that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows\nwhistled over them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo\nbetween the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go\nhis paddle: but the arrow fell back, foiled by his hidden coat of mail.\nAnother passed through Aragorn\u2019s hood; and a third stood fast in\nthe gunwale of the second boat, close by Merry\u2019s hand. Sam thought\nhe could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long\nshingle-banks that lay under the eastern shore. They seemed very\nnear.\n\u2018Yrch! \u2019 said Legolas, falling into his own tongue.\n\u2018Orcs!\u2019 cried Gimli.\n\u2018Gollum\u2019s doing, I\u2019ll be bound,\u2019 said Sam to Frodo. \u2018And a nice\nplace to choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right into\ntheir arms!\u2019\nThey all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a\nhand. Every moment they expected to feel the bite of black-feathered\narrows. Many whined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there\nwere no more hits. It was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes\nof Orcs, and in the star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning\nfoes some mark, unless it was that the grey cloaks of Lo\u00b4 rien and the\ngrey timber of the elf-wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers\nof Mordor.\nStroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to\nbe sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of\nthe water grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back\ninto the night.

{"411": "shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew\nbreath.\nLegolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had\nbrought from Lo\u00b4 rien. Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces\nup the bank. Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering\nback over the River into the darkness. Across the water there were\nshrill cries, but nothing could be seen.\nFrodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed\ninto the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned\nwith sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky\nbehind. But now rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds\nadvanced, sending out dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden\ndread fell on the Company.\n\u2018Elbereth Gilthoniel! \u2019 sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he\ndid so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved\nfar more swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped\ntowards the Company, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon\nit appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the\nnight. Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water. Frodo\nfelt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart;\nthere was a deadly cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his\nshoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide.\nSuddenly the great bow of Lo\u00b4 rien sang. Shrill went the arrow from\nthe elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him the winged\nshape swerved. There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of\nthe air, vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky\nwas clean again. There was a tumult of many voices far away, cursing\nand wailing in the darkness, and then silence. Neither shaft nor cry\ncame again from the east that night.\nAfter a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their\nway along the water\u2019s edge for some distance, until they found a\nsmall shallow bay. A few low trees grew there close to the water, and\nbehind them rose a steep rocky bank. Here the Company decided to\nstay and await the dawn: it was useless to attempt to move further\nby night. They made no camp and lit no fire, but lay huddled in the\nboats, moored close together.\n\u2018Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas!\u2019\nsaid Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. \u2018That was a mighty\nshot in the dark, my friend!\u2019\n\u2018But who can say what it hit?\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018I cannot,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But I am glad that the shadow came no"}
{"412": "\u2018It was not a Balrog,\u2019 said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that\nhad come upon him. \u2018It was something colder. I think it was\u2014\u2014\u2019\nThen he paused and fell silent.\n\u2018What do you think?\u2019 asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat,\nas if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo\u2019s face.\n\u2018I think\u2014No, I will not say,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018Whatever it was,\nits fall has dismayed our enemies.\u2019\n\u2018So it seems,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Yet where they are, and how many,\nand what they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all\nbe sleepless! Dark hides us now. But what the day will show who\ncan tell? Have your weapons close to hand!\u2019\nSam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on\nhis fingers, and looking up at the sky. \u2018It\u2019s very strange,\u2019 he mur-\nmured. \u2018The Moon\u2019s the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it\nought to be. But either it\u2019s out of its running, or I\u2019m all wrong in my\nreckoning. You\u2019ll remember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as\nwe lay on the flet up in that tree: a week from the full, I reckon. And\nwe\u2019d been a week on the way last night, when up pops a New Moon\nas thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never stayed no time in the\nElvish country.\n\u2018Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem\nto remember several more, but I would take my oath it was never a\nwhole month. Anyone would think that time did not count in there!\u2019\n\u2018And perhaps that was the way of it,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018In that land,\nmaybe, we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was\nnot, I think, until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned\nto the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I\ndon\u2019t remember any moon, either new or old, in Caras Galadhon:\nonly stars by night and sun by day.\u2019\nLegolas stirred in his boat. \u2018Nay, time does not tarry ever,\u2019 he said;\n\u2018but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the\nElves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow.\nSwift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it\nis a grief to them. Slow, because they need not count the running\nyears, not for themselves. The passing seasons are but ripples ever\nrepeated in the long long stream. Yet beneath the Sun all things must\nwear to an end at last.\u2019\n\u2018But the wearing is slow in Lo\u00b4 rien,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018The power of the\nLady is on it. Rich are the hours, though short they seem, in Caras\nGaladhon, where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.\u2019\n\u2018That should not have been said outside Lo\u00b4rien, not even to me,\u2019"}
{"413": "The old moon passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the\nworld outside, while we tarried there. And yestereve a new moon\ncame again. Winter is nearly gone. Time flows on to a spring of little\nhope.\u2019\nThe night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across\nthe water. The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing\nof the weather. The air grew warm and very still under the great\nmoist clouds that had floated up from the South and the distant seas.\nThe rushing of the River over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow\nlouder and closer. The twigs of the trees above them began to drip.\nWhen the day came the mood of the world about them had become\nsoft and sad. Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and\nshadowless. There was mist on the River, and white fog swathed the\nshore; the far bank could not be seen.\n\u2018I can\u2019t abide fog,\u2019 said Sam; \u2018but this seems to be a lucky one.\nNow perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing\nus.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps so,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But it will be hard to find the path\nunless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we\nare to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.\u2019\n\u2018I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River\nany further,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we\ncan abandon these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward,\nuntil we come to the Entwash and cross into my own land.\u2019\n\u2018We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018but\nthat is not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than\nit sounds. The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly\nperil there for those on foot and laden. I would not abandon our\nboats until we must. The River is at least a path that cannot be\nmissed.\u2019\n\u2018But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,\u2019 objected Boromir. \u2018And\neven if you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the\nTindrock, what will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in\nthe marshes?\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018Say rather that we will bear our boats\nby the ancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again.\nDo you not know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North\nStair, and the high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made in the days\nof the great kings? I at least have a mind to stand in that high place\nagain, before I decide my further course. There, maybe, we shall see\nsome sign that will guide us.\u2019"}
{"414": "in. \u2018It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends\nat need,\u2019 he said, \u2018and you will need my strength, if ever you are to\nreach the Tindrock. To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There\nI shall turn to my home, alone if my help has not earned the reward\nof any companionship.\u2019\nThe day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was\ndecided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along\nthe shore, while the others remained by the boats. Aragorn hoped to\nfind some way by which they could carry both their boats and their\nbaggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids.\n\u2018Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,\u2019 he said, \u2018but that does\nnot say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have\never done so yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this\nregion, for even in their great days their realm did not reach up\nAnduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but there is a portage-way some-\nwhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It cannot yet have\nperished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to\nOsgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Orcs of\nMordor began to multiply.\u2019\n\u2018Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the\nOrcs prowl on the east-shore,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018If you go forward, peril\nwill grow with every mile, even if you find a path.\u2019\n\u2018Peril lies ahead on every southward road,\u2019 answered Aragorn.\n\u2018Wait for us one day. If we do not return in that time, you will know\nthat evil has indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader\nand follow him as best you can.\u2019\nIt was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas\nclimb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved\ngroundless. Only two or three hours had passed, and it was barely\nmid-day, when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again.\n\u2018All is well,\u2019 said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. \u2018There\nis a track, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. The\ndistance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below\nus, and they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them\nthe stream becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly.\nOur hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old\nportage-way. We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-\nside here, and runs under the lee of a rock-wall, a furlong or more\nfrom the shore. We did not find where the northward landing lies.\nIf it still remains, we must have passed it yesterday night. We might\nlabour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I fear we must leave"}
{"415": "\u2018That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,\u2019 said Boromir.\n\u2018Yet such as we are we will try it,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Aye, we will,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018The legs of Men will lag on a rough\nroad, while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight,\nMaster Boromir!\u2019\nThe task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The\ngoods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank,\nwhere there was a level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the\nwater and carried up. They were far less heavy than any had expected.\nOf what tree growing in the Elvish country they were made not even\nLegolas knew; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light. Merry\nand Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat.\nNonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul\nthem over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It sloped\nup away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders,\nwith many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were\nthickets of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools\nfed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland.\nOne by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the\nothers toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last all\nwas removed and laid on the portage-way. Then with little further\nhindrance, save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they\nmoved forward all together. Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling\nrock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded the River: they could hear\nit rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn\nGebir, but they could not see it. Twice they made the journey, before\nall was brought safe to the southern landing.\nThere the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently\ndown to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been\nscooped in the river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling\ndown from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some\nway into the stream. Beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff,\nand there was no further passage for those on foot.\nAlready the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was\nclosing in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush\nand roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy,\nand their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day.\n\u2018Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,\u2019 said\nBoromir. \u2018We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass\nthe Gates of Argonath by night, we are all too tired \u2013 except, no\ndoubt, our sturdy dwarf.\u2019"}
{"416": "we must journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once more\nand cheats us, we shall have a good chance of slipping through,\nunseen by any eyes on the eastern shore. But tonight two must watch\ntogether in turns: three hours off and one on guard.\u2019\nNothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an\nhour before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already\nthe fog was thinning. They kept as close as they could to the western\nside, and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever\nhigher, shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river. In the\nmid-morning the clouds drew down lower, and it began to rain\nheavily. They drew the skin-covers over their boats to prevent them\nfrom being flooded, and drifted on; little could be seen before them\nor about them through the grey falling curtains.\nThe rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew\nlighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes\ntrailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone.\nBefore the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which\nclung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The\nchannel grew narrower and the River swifter. Now they were speeding\nalong with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might\nmeet ahead. Over them was a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the\ndark overshadowed River, and before them black, shutting out the\nsun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no opening could be seen.\nFrodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks\napproaching: like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed. Tall\nand sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream. A\nnarrow gap appeared between them, and the River swept the boats\ntowards it.\n\u2018Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings!\u2019 cried Aragorn.\n\u2018We shall pass them soon. Keep the boats in line, and as far apart as\nyou can! Hold the middle of the stream!\u2019\nAs Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers\nto meet him. Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but\nthreatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and\nfashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and\nstill they preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the\nmighty likenesses in which they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals\nfounded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone: still with\nblurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the North.

Even Boromir bowed his head as the\nboats whirled by, frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring\nshadow of the sentinels of Nu\u00b4menor. So they passed into the dark\nchasm of the Gates.\nSheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side.\nFar off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and\na wind screamed over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard\nSam in front muttering and groaning: \u2018What a place! What a horrible\nplace! Just let me get out of this boat, and I\u2019ll never wet my toes in\na puddle again, let alone a river!\u2019\n\u2018Fear not!\u2019 said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw\nStrider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was no\nlonger there. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and\nerect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back,\nand his dark hair was blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a\nking returning from exile to his own land.\n\u2018Fear not!\u2019 he said. \u2018Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses\nof Isildur and Ana\u00b4rion, my sires of old.

How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and\nthe walls of my own city! But whither now shall I go?\u2019\nThe chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind\nand rushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards the\nwest so that at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall\ngap of light before him, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and sud-\ndenly the boats shot through, out into a wide clear light.\nThe sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy\nsky. The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen\nHithoel, fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees,\nbut their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far\nsouthern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward\nfrom the others and sundered from them, an island in the waters,\nabout which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant\nbut deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of\nthunder heard far away.\n\u2018Behold Tol Brandir!\u2019 said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak.\n\u2018Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen,\ntheHillsofHearingandofSight.Inthedaysofthegreatkingsthere"}
{"418": "Ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them. I hear the endless\nvoice of Rauros calling.\u2019\nThe Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current\nthat flowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and\nthen they took to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides\nof the westward hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and\nred. Here and there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed\nbefore them, darkling in the twilight. Rauros was roaring with a great\nvoice. Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers\ncame at last under the shadow of the hills.\nThe tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind\nthem. They could go no further without choice between the east-way\nand the west. The last stage of the Quest was before them."}

Here upon its western\nside under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the\nwater from the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle\nslopes of the hill clad with trees, and trees marched away westward\nalong the curving shores of the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down\nand fed the grass.\n\u2018Here we will rest tonight,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018This is the lawn of Parth\nGalen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope that no\nevil has yet come here.\u2019\nThey drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them\nthey made their camp. They set a watch, but had no sight nor sound\nof their enemies. If Gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained\nunseen and unheard. Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew\nuneasy, tossing often in his sleep and waking. In the small hours he\ngot up and came to Frodo, whose turn it was to watch.\n\u2018Why are you waking?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018It is not your watch.\u2019\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 answered Aragorn; \u2018but a shadow and a threat\nhas been growing in my sleep.

To his dismay the\nedges gleamed dimly in the night. \u2018Orcs!\u2019 he said. \u2018Not very near,\nand yet too near, it seems.\u2019\n\u2018I feared as much,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But maybe they are not on this\nside of the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may point to no\nmore than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I\nhave never heard before of Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows\nwhat may happen in these evil days, now that Minas Tirith no longer\nholds secure the passages of Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.\u2019\nThe day came like fire and smoke.

What shall now become of our Company that has travelled\nso far in fellowship?

We cannot long halt here. The\nenemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the Orcs may\nalready be on this side of the water.\u2019\nThere was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved.\n\u2018Well, Frodo,\u2019 said Aragorn at last. \u2018I fear that the burden is laid\nupon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Council. Your own\nway you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am\nnot Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know\nwhat design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most\nlikely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait\non you. Such is your fate.\u2019\nFrodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. \u2018I know that\nhaste is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me\nan hour longer, and I will speak. Let me be alone!\u2019\nAragorn looked at him with kindly pity. \u2018Very well, Frodo son of\nDrogo,\u2019 he said. \u2018You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. We\nwill stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.\u2019\nFrodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been\nwatching his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered:\n\u2018Plain as a pikestaff it is, but it\u2019s no good Sam Gamgee putting in\nhis spoke just now.\u2019\nPresently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while\nthe others restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes\nof Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in\nthe trees at the foot of Amon Hen.\nWandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his\nfeet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He came to\na path, the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places\nstairs of stone had been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn,\nand split by the roots of trees.

{"421": "sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the River, far below him,\nto Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between\nhim and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring\nmingled with a deep throbbing boom.\nHe sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands,\nstaring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened\nsince Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he re-\ncalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf \u2019s\nwords. Time went on, and still he was no nearer to a choice.\nSuddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to\nhim that something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon\nhim. He sprang up and turned; but all that he saw to his surprise\nwas Boromir, and his face was smiling and kind.\n\u2018I was afraid for you, Frodo,\u2019 he said, coming forward. \u2018If Aragorn\nis right and Orcs are near, then none of us should wander alone, and\nyou least of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy.\nMay I stay now and talk for a while, since I have found you? It would\ncomfort me. Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate\nwithout end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom.\u2019\n\u2018You are kind,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018But I do not think that any\nspeech will help me. For I know what I should do, but I am afraid\nof doing it, Boromir: afraid.\u2019\nBoromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind mur-\nmured in the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered.\nSuddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. \u2018Are you sure that\nyou do not suffer needlessly?\u2019 he said. \u2018I wish to help you. You need\ncounsel in your hard choice. Will you not take mine?\u2019\n\u2018I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,\u2019\nsaid Frodo. \u2018And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of\nmy heart.\u2019\n\u2018Warning? Warning against what?\u2019 said Boromir sharply.\n\u2018Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal\nof the burden that is laid on me. Against \u2013 well, if it must be said,\nagainst trust in the strength and truth of Men.\u2019\n\u2018Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little\ncountry, though you knew it not.\u2019\n\u2018I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is chang-\ning. The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong\nenough. If they fail, what then?\u2019\n\u2018We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they\nwill not fail.\u2019\n\u2018No hope while the Ring lasts,\u2019 said Frodo."}
{"422": "so small a thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an\ninstant in the house of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again?\u2019\nFrodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the\nstrange gleam in Boromir\u2019s eyes, yet his face was still kind and\nfriendly. \u2018It is best that it should lie hidden,\u2019 he answered.\n\u2018As you wish. I care not,\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018Yet may I not even speak\nof it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of\nthe Enemy: of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing,\nyou say. Minas Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly,\nif the Ring were with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us?\u2019\n\u2018Were you not at the Council?\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018Because we\ncannot use it, and what is done with it turns to evil.\u2019\nBoromir got up and walked about impatiently. \u2018So you go on,\u2019 he\ncried. \u2018Gandalf, Elrond \u2013 all these folk have taught you to say so.\nFor themselves they may be right. These elves and half-elves and\nwizards, they would come to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they\nare wise and not merely timid. But each to his own kind. True-hearted\nMen, they will not be corrupted. We of Minas Tirith have been\nstaunch through long years of trial. We do not desire the power of\nwizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, strength in a just\ncause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the Ring of\nPower. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad not\nto use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless,\nthe ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior\ndo in this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if\nhe refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of\nCommand. How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, and all men\nwould flock to my banner!\u2019\nBoromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly. Almost\nhe seemed to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and\nweapons, and the mustering of men; and he drew plans for great\nalliances and glorious victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and\nbecame himself a mighty king, benevolent and wise. Suddenly he\nstopped and waved his arms.\n\u2018And they tell us to throw it away!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I do not say destroy\nit. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so.\nIt does not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling\nshould walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance\nof recapturing it for himself. Folly!\n\u2018Surely you see it, my friend?\u2019 he said, turning now suddenly to\nFrodo again. \u2018You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest\nshould pardon you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?\u2019"}
{"423": "\u2018Then you will come to Minas Tirith?\u2019 cried Boromir. His eyes\nwere shining and his face eager.\n\u2018You misunderstand me,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018But you will come, at least for a while?\u2019 Boromir persisted. \u2018My\ncity is not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than\nfrom here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news\nof what the Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with\nme, Frodo,\u2019 he said. \u2018You need rest before your venture, if go you\nmust.\u2019 He laid his hand on the hobbit\u2019s shoulder in friendly fashion;\nbut Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He\nstepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice\nhis height and many times his match in strength.\n\u2018Why are you so unfriendly?\u2019 said Boromir. \u2018I am a true man,\nneither thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but\nI give you my word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at\nleast let me make trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring!\u2019\n\u2018No! no!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018The Council laid it upon me to bear it.\u2019\n\u2018It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,\u2019 cried Boromir.\n\u2018How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death\nand ruining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is\nthe men of Nu\u00b4menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by\nunhappy chance. It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give\nit to me!\u2019\nFrodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone\nstood between them. \u2018Come, come, my friend!\u2019 said Boromir in a\nsofter voice. \u2018Why not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt\nand fear? You can lay the blame on me, if you will. You can say that\nI was too strong and took it by force. For I am too strong for you,\nhalfling,\u2019 he cried; and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped\nat Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging\nfire was in his eyes.\nFrodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There\nwas only one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring\nupon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir\nsprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed,\nand then ran wildly about, seeking here and there among the rocks\nand trees.\n\u2018Miserable trickster!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Let me get my hands on you!\nNow I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us\nall. You have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse\nyou and all halflings to death and darkness!\u2019 Then, catching his foot\non a stone, he fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he"}
{"424": "He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears.\n\u2018What have I said?\u2019 he cried. \u2018What have I done? Frodo, Frodo!\u2019 he\ncalled. \u2018Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come\nback!\u2019\nThere was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was\nalready far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror\nand grief shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of\nBoromir, and his burning eyes.\nSoon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted,\ngasping for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved\nwith mighty flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and\nin the middle, set upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached\nby a stair of many steps. Up he went and sat upon the ancient\nchair, feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of\nmountain-kings.\nAt first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in\nwhich there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here\nand there the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and\nclear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote.\nThere was no sound, only bright living images. The world seemed\nto have shrunk and fallen silent. He was sitting upon the Seat of\nSeeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Nu\u00b4menor.\nEastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, and\nforests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay\nlike a ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and\nhard as broken teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures\nof Rohan; and Orthanc, the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike.\nSouthward he looked, and below his very feet the Great River curled\nlike a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a\nfoaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume. And Ethir\nAnduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of sea-birds\nwhirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and\nsilver sea, rippling in endless lines.\nBut everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty\nMountains were crawling like anthills: orcs were issuing out of a\nthousand holes. Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly\nstrife of Elves and Men and fell beasts. The land of the Beornings\nwas aflame; a cloud was over Moria; smoke rose on the borders of\nLo\u00b4rien.\nHorsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured\nfrom Isengard.

{"425": "wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion. Then turning\nsouth again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it seemed, and beauti-\nful: white-walled, many-towered, proud and fair upon its mountain-\nseat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were bright\nwith many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas\nTirith was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither,\neastward, unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges\nof Osgiliath, the grinning gates of Minas Morgul, and the haunted\nMountains, and it looked upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the\nLand of Mordor. Darkness lay there under the Sun. Fire glowed\namid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, and a great reek rising.\nThen at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon\nbattlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of\nsteel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-du\u02c6r, Fortress of Sauron.\nAll hope left him.\nAnd suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower\nthat did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A\nfierce eager will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger\nhe felt it, searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know\njust exactly where he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon\nTol Brandir \u2013 he threw himself from the seat, crouching, covering\nhis head with his grey hood.\nHe heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come,\nI come to you? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other\npoint of power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off !\nTake it off ! Fool, take it off ! Take off the Ring!\nThe two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced\nbetween their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he\nwas aware of himself again, Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye:\nfree to choose, and with one remaining instant in which to do so.\nHe took the Ring off his finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight\nbefore the high seat. A black shadow seemed to pass like an arm\nabove him; it missed Amon Hen and groped out west, and faded.\nThen all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree.\nFrodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will\nwas firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. \u2018I will do\nnow what I must,\u2019 he said. \u2018This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring\nis already at work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave\nthem before it does more harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust,\nand those I can trust are too dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry\nand Pippin. Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, and he\nwillbeneededthere,nowBoromirhasfallenintoevil.Iwillgoalone."}
{"426": "Boromir had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he\ncould hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below.\n\u2018They\u2019ll be hunting for me,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wonder how long I have\nbeen away. Hours, I should think.\u2019 He hesitated. \u2018What can I do?\u2019\nhe muttered. \u2018I must go now or I shall never go. I shan\u2019t get a chance\nagain. I hate leaving them, and like this without any explanation. But\nsurely they will understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?\u2019\nSlowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished\nand passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind.\nThe others remained long by the river-side. For some time they\nhad been silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting\nin a circle, and they were talking. Every now and again they made\nefforts to speak of other things, of their long road and many adven-\ntures; they questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and\nits ancient history, and the remnants of its great works that could\nstill be seen in this strange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone\nkings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the\nfalls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words strayed back to\nFrodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why was he\nhesitating?\n\u2018He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,\u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for\nthe Company to go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum, and\nmust fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas\nTirith is no nearer to the Fire and the destruction of the Burden.\n\u2018We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but\nthe Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even\nElrond said was beyond his power: either to keep the Burden secret,\nor to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes to take it.\nWhich way would any of us choose in Frodo\u2019s place? I do not know.\nNow indeed we miss Gandalf most.\u2019\n\u2018Grievous is our loss,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Yet we must needs make up\nour minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo?\nLet us call him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.\u2019\n\u2018And so should I,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018We, of course, were only sent to\nhelp the Bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and\nnone of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom.\nHard was my parting from Lothlo\u00b4 rien. Yet I have come so far, and\nI say this: now we have reached the last choice, it is clear to me that\nI cannot leave Frodo. I would choose Minas Tirith, but if he does\nnot, then I follow him.\u2019"}
{"427": "\u2018It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think\nthat all should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as\nfor three or two, or one alone. If you would let me choose, then I\nshould appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear it other-\nwise; and Gimli; and myself. Boromir will return to his own city,\nwhere his father and his people need him; and with him the others\nshould go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, if Legolas is not willing\nto leave us.\u2019\n\u2018That won\u2019t do at all!\u2019 cried Merry. \u2018We can\u2019t leave Frodo! Pippin\nand I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. But\nwe did not realize what that would mean. It seemed different so far\naway, in the Shire or in Rivendell. It would be mad and cruel to let\nFrodo go to Mordor. Why can\u2019t we stop him?\u2019\n\u2018We must stop him,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018And that is what he is worrying\nabout, I am sure. He knows we shan\u2019t agree to his going east. And\nhe doesn\u2019t like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine\nit: going off to Mordor alone!\u2019 Pippin shuddered. \u2018But the dear silly\nold hobbit, he ought to know that he hasn\u2019t got to ask. He ought to\nknow that if we can\u2019t stop him, we shan\u2019t leave him.\u2019\n\u2018Begging your pardon,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand\nmy master at all. He isn\u2019t hesitating about which way to go. Of course\nnot! What\u2019s the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean,\nbegging your pardon, Master Boromir,\u2019 he added, and turned. It was\nthen that they discovered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting\nsilent on the outside of the circle, was no longer there.\n\u2018Now where\u2019s he got to?\u2019 cried Sam, looking worried. \u2018He\u2019s been\na bit queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he\u2019s not in this business.\nHe\u2019s off to his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But\nMr. Frodo, he knows he\u2019s got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can.\nBut he\u2019s afraid. Now it\u2019s come to the point, he\u2019s just plain terrified.\nThat\u2019s what his trouble is. Of course he\u2019s had a bit of schooling, so\nto speak \u2013 we all have \u2013 since we left home, or he\u2019d be so terrified\nhe\u2019d just fling the Ring in the River and bolt. But he\u2019s still too\nfrightened to start. And he isn\u2019t worrying about us either: whether\nwe\u2019ll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That\u2019s another\nthing that\u2019s bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he\u2019ll want\nto go alone. Mark my words! We\u2019re going to have trouble when he\ncomes back. For he\u2019ll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name\u2019s\nBaggins.\u2019\n\u2018I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,\u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018And what shall we do, if you prove right?\u2019"}
{"428": "Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to drive him one\nway or the other.

Surely\nthe time is up?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018The hour is long passed. The morning is\nwearing away. We must call for him.\u2019\nAt that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees\nand walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim\nand sad. He paused as if counting those that were present, and then\nsat down aloof, with his eyes on the ground.\n\u2018Where have you been, Boromir?\u2019 asked Aragorn. \u2018Have you seen\nFrodo?\u2019\nBoromir hesitated for a second. \u2018Yes, and no,\u2019 he answered slowly.\n\u2018Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged\nhim to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and\nhe left me. He vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen\nbefore, though I have heard of it in tales. He must have put the Ring\non. I could not find him again. I thought he would return to you.\u2019\n\u2018Is that all that you have to say?\u2019 said Aragorn, looking hard and\nnot too kindly at Boromir.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he answered. \u2018I will say no more yet.\u2019\n\u2018This is bad!\u2019 cried Sam, jumping up. \u2018I don\u2019t know what this Man\nhas been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn\u2019t\nought to have; and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!\u2019\n\u2018But he wouldn\u2019t keep it on,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Not when he had\nescaped the unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.\u2019\n\u2018But where did he go? Where is he?\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018He\u2019s been away\nages now.\u2019\n\u2018How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir?\u2019 asked Aragorn.\n\u2018Half an hour, maybe,\u2019 he answered. \u2018Or it might be an hour. I\nhave wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know!\u2019\nHe put his head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief.\n\u2018An hour since he vanished!\u2019 shouted Sam. \u2018We must try and find\nhim at once.

He came to the edge of the lawn of\nParth Galen by the shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the\nwater. No one was there. There seemed to be cries in the woods\nbehind, but he did not heed them. He stood gazing for a moment,\nstock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the bank all by itself.\nWith a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat slipped into the\nwater.\n\u2018Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming!\u2019 called Sam, and flung himself\nfrom the bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a\nyard. With a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift\nwater.

If they catch me here, I shall have to\nargue and explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to\nget off. But I must go at once. It\u2019s the only way.\u2019\n\u2018Of course it is,\u2019 answered Sam. \u2018But not alone. I\u2019m coming too,\nor neither of us isn\u2019t going. I\u2019ll knock holes in all the boats first.\u2019\nFrodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched\nhis heart. \u2018Leave one!\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ll need it. But you can\u2019t come\nlike this without your gear or food or anything.\u2019\n\u2018Just hold on a moment, and I\u2019ll get my stuff !\u2019 cried Sam eagerly.\n\u2018It\u2019s all ready. I thought we should be off today.\u2019 He rushed to the\ncamping place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had\nlaid it when he emptied the boat of his companions\u2019 goods, grabbed\na spare blanket, and some extra packages of food, and ran back.\n\u2018So all my plan is spoilt!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It is no good trying to escape\nyou. But I\u2019m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It\nis plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the\nothers find a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don\u2019t suppose"}
{"431": "So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together.\nFrodo paddled away from the shore, and the River bore them swiftly\naway, down the western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol\nBrandir. The roar of the great falls drew nearer. Even with such help\nas Sam could give, it was hard work to pass across the current at the\nsouthward end of the island and drive the boat eastward towards the\nfar shore.\nAt length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of\nAmon Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew the\nboat out, high above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind\na great boulder. Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking\na path that would bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil,\nand down into the Land of Shadow."}

{"437": "Chapter 1\nTHE DEPARTURE OF BOROMIR\nAragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the\nground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for\na Ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path,\nand in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.\n\u2018I read the signs aright,\u2019 he said to himself. \u2018Frodo ran to the\nhill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same\nway, and went down the hill again.\u2019\nAragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself,\nhoping to see there something that would guide him in his per-\nplexities; but time was pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and\nran to the summit, across the great flag-stones, and up the steps.\nThen sitting in the high seat he looked out. But the sun seemed\ndarkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned from the North\nback again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless\nit were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle\nhigh in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the\nearth.\nEven as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands\nbelow, on the west side of the River. He stiffened. There were cries,\nand among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices\nof Orcs. Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew,\nand the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising\nin a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.\n\u2018The horn of Boromir!\u2019 he cried. \u2018He is in need!\u2019 He sprang down\nthe steps and away, leaping down the path. \u2018Alas! An ill fate is on\nme this day, and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?\u2019\nAs he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately\nthe horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs,\nand suddenly the horn-calls ceased. Aragorn raced down the last\nslope, but before he could reach the hill\u2019s foot, the sounds died away;\nand as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated,\nuntil at last he could hear them no more. Drawing his bright sword\nand crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed through the trees.\nA mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the\nlake he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree,"}
{"438": "broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many\nOrcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.\nAragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to\nspeak. At last slow words came. \u2018I tried to take the Ring from Frodo,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018I am sorry. I have paid.\u2019 His glance strayed to his fallen enemies;\ntwenty at least lay there. \u2018They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have\ntaken them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.\u2019 He paused\nand his eyes closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again.\n\u2018Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I\nhave failed.\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. \u2018You\nhave conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas\nTirith shall not fall!\u2019\nBoromir smiled.\n\u2018Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?\u2019 said Aragorn.\nBut Boromir did not speak again.\n\u2018Alas!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Thus passes the heir of Denethor, Lord of\nthe Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all\nin ruin. It is I that have failed. Vain was Gandalf \u2019s trust in me. What\nshall I do now? Boromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith, and\nmy heart desires it; but where are the Ring and the Bearer? How\nshall I find them and save the Quest from disaster?\u2019\nHe knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir\u2019s\nhand. So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from\nthe western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as\nif they were hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long\nknife: all his arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they\nhalted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads\nbowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.\n\u2018Alas!\u2019 said Legolas, coming to Aragorn\u2019s side. \u2018We have hunted\nand slain many Orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more\nuse here. We came when we heard the horn \u2013 but too late, it seems.\nI fear you have taken deadly hurt.\u2019\n\u2018Boromir is dead,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018I am unscathed, for I was not\nhere with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon\nthe hill.\u2019\n\u2018The hobbits!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018Where are they then? Where is Frodo?\u2019\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 answered Aragorn wearily. \u2018Before he died\nBoromir told me that the Orcs had bound them; he did not think\nthat they were dead. I sent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did\nnot ask him if Frodo or Sam were with him: not until it was too late.\nAllthatIhavedonetodayhasgoneamiss.Whatistobedonenow?\u2019"}
{"439": "\u2018But we must be swift,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018He would not wish us to\nlinger. We must follow the Orcs, if there is hope that any of our\nCompany are living prisoners.\u2019\n\u2018But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or\nnot,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him\nfirst? An evil choice is now before us!\u2019\n\u2018Then let us do first what we must do,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018We have\nnot the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a\nmound over him. A cairn we might build.\u2019\n\u2018The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we\ncould use nearer than the water-side,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons\nof his vanquished foes,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We will send him to the Falls\nof Rauros and give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take\ncare at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.\u2019\nQuickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs, gathering their\nswords and cloven helms and shields into a heap.\n\u2018See!\u2019 cried Aragorn. \u2018Here we find tokens!\u2019 He picked out from\nthe pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold\nand red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set\nwith small red gems. \u2018No orc-tools these!\u2019 he said. \u2018They were borne\nby the hobbits. Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them, but feared to\nkeep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of Wester-\nnesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, now,\nif they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things,\nhoping against hope, to give them back.\u2019\n\u2018And I,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018will take all the arrows that I can find, for\nmy quiver is empty.\u2019 He searched in the pile and on the ground about\nand found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft\nthan such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at\nthem closely.\nAnd Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: \u2018Here lie many that\nare not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty\nMountains, if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds. And here are\nothers strange to me. Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at\nall!\u2019\nThere were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-\neyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short\nbroad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with Orcs;\nand they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men.\nUpon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in"}
{"440": "\u2018I have not seen these tokens before,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018What do they\nmean?\u2019\n\u2018S is for Sauron,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018That is easy to read.\u2019\n\u2018Nay!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Sauron does not use the elf-runes.\u2019\n\u2018Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or\nspoken,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018And he does not use white. The Orcs in the\nservice of Barad-du\u02c6r use the sign of the Red Eye.\u2019 He stood for a\nmoment in thought. \u2018S is for Saruman, I guess,\u2019 he said at length.\n\u2018There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is\nas Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news\nof our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf \u2019s fall. Pursuers\nfrom Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lo\u00b4rien, or they may\nhave avoided that land and come to Isengard by other paths. Orcs\ntravel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning news. Do you\nremember the birds?\u2019\n\u2018Well, we have no time to ponder riddles,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Let us bear\nBoromir away!\u2019\n\u2018But after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our\ncourse rightly,\u2019 answered Aragorn.\n\u2018Maybe there is no right choice,\u2019 said Gimli.\nTaking his axe the Dwarf now cut several branches. These they\nlashed together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the\nframe. Upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion\nto the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they\nchose to send forth with him. It was only a short way, yet they found\nit no easy task, for Boromir was a man both tall and strong.\nAt the water-side Aragorn remained, watching the bier, while\nLegolas and Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth Galen. It was a\nmile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling\ntwo boats swiftly along the shore.\n\u2018There is a strange tale to tell!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018There are only two\nboats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.\u2019\n\u2018Have Orcs been there?\u2019 asked Aragorn.\n\u2018We saw no signs of them,\u2019 answered Gimli. \u2018And Orcs would\nhave taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.\u2019\n\u2018I will look at the ground when we come there,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nNow they laid Boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear\nhim away. The grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed\nbeneath his head. They combed his long dark hair and arrayed it\nupon his shoulders. The golden belt of Lo\u00b4rien gleamed about his"}
{"441": "they put the swords of his enemies. Then fastening the prow to the\nstern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. They rowed\nsadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel\nthey passed the green sward of Parth Galen. The steep sides of Tol\nBrandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. As they went south\nthe fume of Rauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold.\nThe rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air.\nSorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay,\nrestful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. The\nstream took him while they held their own boat back with their\npaddles. He floated by them, and slowly his boat departed, waning\nto a dark spot against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished.\nRauros roared on unchanging. The River had taken Boromir son of\nDenethor, and he was not seen again in Minas Tirith, standing as\nhe used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning. But in\nGondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat rode the\nfalls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through Osgiliath,\nand past the many mouths of Anduin, out into the Great Sea at night\nunder the stars.\nFor a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after\nhim. Then Aragorn spoke. \u2018They will look for him from the White\nTower,\u2019 he said, \u2018but he will not return from mountain or from sea.\u2019\nThen slowly he began to sing:\nThrough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows\nThe West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.\n\u2018What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to\nme tonight?\nHave you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?\u2019\n\u2018I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;\nI saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away\nInto the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more.\nThe North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of\nDenethor.\u2019\n\u2018O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar,\nBut you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\u2019\nThen Legolas sang:\nFrom the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the"}
{"442": "\u2018What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me\nat eve?\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.\u2019\n\u2018Ask not of me where he doth dwell \u2013 so many bones there lie\nOn the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;\nSo many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea.\nAsk of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to\nme!\u2019\n\u2018O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south,\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea\u2019s\nmouth.\u2019\nThen Aragorn sang again:\nFrom the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides, and past the\nroaring falls;\nAnd clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.\n\u2018What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me\ntoday?\nWhat news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.\u2019\n\u2018Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought.\nHis cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\nHis head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\nAnd Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.\u2019\n\u2018O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\nTo Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days.\u2019\nSo they ended. Then they turned their boat and drove it with all\nthe speed they could against the stream back to Parth Galen.\n\u2018You left the East Wind to me,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018but I will say naught\nof it.\u2019\n\u2018That is as it should be,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018In Minas Tirith they endure\nthe East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir\nhas taken his road, and we must make haste to choose our own.\u2019\nHe surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping\noften to the earth. \u2018No Orcs have been on this ground,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. All our footprints\nare here, crossing and re-crossing. I cannot tell whether any of the\nhobbits have come back since the search for Frodo began.\u2019 He\nreturned to the bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled\nout into the River. \u2018There are some clear prints here,\u2019 he said. \u2018A\nhobbitwadedoutintothewaterandback;butIcannotsayhowlong"}
{"443": "Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-\nplace and looked at the baggage. \u2018Two packs are missing,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018and one is certainly Sam\u2019s: it was rather large and heavy. This then\nis the answer: Frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with\nhim. Frodo must have returned while we were all away. I met Sam\ngoing up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not\ndo so. He guessed his master\u2019s mind and came back here before\nFrodo had gone. He did not find it easy to leave Sam behind!\u2019\n\u2018But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?\u2019 said\nGimli. \u2018That was a strange deed!\u2019\n\u2018And a brave deed,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Sam was right, I think. Frodo\ndid not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he\nknew that he must go himself. Something happened after he left us\nthat overcame his fear and doubt.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018He fled, certainly,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018but not, I think, from Orcs.\u2019\nWhat he thought was the cause of Frodo\u2019s sudden resolve and flight\nAragorn did not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.\n\u2018Well, so much at least is now clear,\u2019 said Legolas: \u2018Frodo is no\nlonger on this side of the River: only he can have taken the boat.\nAnd Sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.\u2019\n\u2018Our choice then,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018is either to take the remaining boat\nand follow Frodo, or else to follow the Orcs on foot. There is little\nhope either way. We have already lost precious hours.\u2019\n\u2018Let me think!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018And now may I make a right choice,\nand change the evil fate of this unhappy day!\u2019 He stood silent for a\nmoment. \u2018I will follow the Orcs,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018I would have guided\nFrodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek him\nnow in the wilderness, I must abandon the captives to torment and\ndeath. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer is in my\nhands no longer. The Company has played its part. Yet we that\nremain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left.\nCome! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared behind! We will\npress on by day and dark!\u2019\nThey drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. They laid\nbeneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not\ncarry away. Then they left Parth Galen. The afternoon was fading\nas they came back to the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they\npicked up the trail of the Orcs. It needed little skill to find.\n\u2018No other folk make such a trampling,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018It seems\ntheirdelighttoslashandbeatdowngrowingthingsthatarenoteven"}
{"444": "they do not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in\nhard bare lands.\u2019\n\u2018Well, after them!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Dwarves too can go swiftly, and\nthey do not tire sooner than Orcs. But it will be a long chase: they\nhave a long start.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018we shall all need the endurance of Dwarves.\nBut come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of\nour enemies. And woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We will\nmake such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the Three\nKindreds: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Forth the Three Hunters!\u2019\nLike a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and\non he led them, tireless and swift, now that his mind was at last made\nup. The woods about the lake they left behind. Long slopes they\nclimbed, dark, hard-edged against the sky already red with sunset.\nDusk came. They passed away, grey shadows in a stony land."}
{"445": "Chapter 2\nTHE RIDERS OF ROHAN\nDusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and\nbrooded on the pale margins of the Anduin, but the sky was clear.\nStars came out. The waxing moon was riding in the West, and the\nshadows of the rocks were black. They had come to the feet of stony\nhills, and their pace was slower, for the trail was no longer easy to\nfollow. Here the highlands of the Emyn Muil ran from North to\nSouth in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of each ridge\nwas steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed\nwith many gullies and narrow ravines. All night the three companions\nscrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first and\ntallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding\nvalley on the other side.\nThere in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief\nspace. The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered\nabove them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark\nhills behind. For the moment Aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had\ndescended into the valley, but there it had vanished.\n\u2018Which way would they turn, do you think?\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018North-\nward to take a straighter road to Isengard, or Fangorn, if that is their\naim as you guess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?\u2019\n\u2018They will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at,\u2019\nsaid Aragorn. \u2018And unless there is much amiss in Rohan and the\npower of Saruman is greatly increased, they will take the shortest\nway that they can find over the fields of the Rohirrim. Let us search\nnorthwards!\u2019\nThe dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a\ntrickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. A cliff\nfrowned upon their right; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and\nshadowy in the late night. They went on for a mile or more north-\nwards. Aragorn was searching, bent towards the ground, among the\nfolds and gullies leading up into the western ridge. Legolas was some\nway ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a cry and the others came running\ntowards him.\n\u2018We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Look!\u2019 He pointed, and they saw that what they had at first"}

Do any folk dwell\nin these hills?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018The Rohirrim seldom come here, and it is\nfar from Minas Tirith. It might be that some company of Men were\nhunting here for reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.\u2019\n\u2018What do you think?\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,\u2019\nanswered Aragorn. \u2018These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among\nthe slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange badges. There\nwas a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk.\nMaybe there was some dispute about the road.\u2019\n\u2018Or about the captives,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Let us hope that they, too,\ndid not meet their end here.\u2019\nAragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces\nof the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky\nwas turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly\ngrowing. A little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny\nstream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the\nvalley. In it some bushes grew, and there were patches of grass upon\nits sides.\n\u2018At last!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Here are the tracks that we seek! Up this\nwater-channel: this is the way that the Orcs went after their debate.\u2019\nSwiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if\nfresh from a night\u2019s rest they sprang from stone to stone. At last they\nreached the crest of the grey hill, and a sudden breeze blew in their\nhair and stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn.\nTurning back they saw across the River the far hills kindled. Day\nleaped into the sky. The red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders\nof the dark land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless\nand grey; but even as they looked, the shadows of night melted, the\ncolours of the waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide\nmeads of Rohan; the white mists shimmered in the water-vales; and\nfar off to the left, thirty leagues or more, blue and purple stood the\nWhite Mountains, rising into peaks of jet, tipped with glimmering\nsnows, flushed with the rose of morning.\n\u2018Gondor! Gondor!\u2019 cried Aragorn. \u2018Would that I looked on you"}
{"447": "Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!\nWest Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree\nFell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old.\nO proud walls! White towers! O winge\u00b4d crown and throne of gold!\nO Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree,\nOr West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?\nNow let us go!\u2019 he said, drawing his eyes away from the South, and\nlooking out west and north to the way that he must tread.\nThe ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply\nbefore their feet. Below it twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide\nand rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the\nEast Wall of Rohan. So ended the Emyn Muil, and the green plains of\nthe Rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them.\n\u2018There is the eagle again! He is very high. He seems to be flying now\naway, from this land back to the North. He is going with great speed.\nLook!\u2019\n\u2018No, not even my eyes can see him, my good Legolas,\u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018He must be far aloft indeed. I wonder what is his errand,\nif he is the same bird that I have seen before. But look! I can see\nsomething nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something\nmoving over the plain!\u2019\n\u2018Many things,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018It is a great company on foot; but I\ncannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are\nmany leagues away: twelve, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is\nhard to measure.\u2019\n\u2018I think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us\nwhich way to go,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Let us find a path down to the fields\nas quick as may be.\u2019\n\u2018I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the Orcs\nchose,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nThey followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. It\nseemed that the Orcs had pressed on with all possible speed. Every\nnow and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or\ncast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread, a torn\nblack cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. The trail\nled them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they\ncame to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed\nnoisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a\nsteep stair into the plain."}
{"448": "Muil. The falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and\nwater-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels,\ndown long gentle slopes towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away.\nThey seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. Here\nthe air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was\nalready stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. Legolas\ntook a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long\nthirst in barren places.\n\u2018Ah! the green smell!\u2019 he said. \u2018It is better than much sleep. Let\nus run!\u2019\n\u2018Light feet may run swiftly here,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018More swiftly,\nmaybe, than iron-shod Orcs. Now we have a chance to lessen their\nlead!\u2019\nThey went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent,\nand an eager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west the broad swath\nof the marching Orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of Rohan\nhad been bruised and blackened as they passed. Presently Aragorn\ngave a cry and turned aside.\n\u2018Stay!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Do not follow me yet!\u2019 He ran quickly to the\nright, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went\nthat way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod\nfeet. These, however, did not go far before they were crossed by\norc-prints, also coming out from the main trail behind and in front,\nand then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the tramp-\nling. At the furthest point Aragorn stooped and picked up something\nfrom the grass; then he ran back.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018they are quite plain: a hobbit\u2019s footprints. Pippin\u2019s,\nI think. He is smaller than the others. And look at this!\u2019 He held up\na thing that glittered in the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened\nleaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.\n\u2018The brooch of an elven-cloak!\u2019 cried Legolas and Gimli together.\n\u2018Not idly do the leaves of Lo\u00b4 rien fall,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018This did not\ndrop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow.\nI think Pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.\u2019\n\u2018Then he at least was alive,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018And he had the use of\nhis wits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue\nin vain.\u2019\n\u2018Let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,\u2019 said\nLegolas. \u2018Come! Let us go on! The thought of those merry young\nfolk driven like cattle burns my heart.\u2019"}
{"449": "blown away upon the breeze. The sun sank. Shadows rose behind\nand reached out long arms from the East. Still the hunters held on.\nOne day now had passed since Boromir fell, and the Orcs were yet\nfar ahead. No longer could any sight of them be seen in the level\nplains.\nAs nightshade was closing about them Aragorn halted. Only twice\nin the day\u2019s march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve\nleagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had\nstood at dawn.\n\u2018We have come at last to a hard choice,\u2019 he said. \u2018Shall we rest by\nnight, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?\u2019\n\u2018Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we\nstay to sleep,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Surely even Orcs must pause on the march?\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Seldom will Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these\nhave done so,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Certainly they will not rest by night.\u2019\n\u2018But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018The trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my\neyes can see,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Maybe, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the\nline,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then\nwhen light came there might be long delay before the trail was found\nagain.\u2019\n\u2018And there is this also,\u2019 said Gimli: \u2018only by day can we see if any\ntracks lead away. If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be\ncarried off, eastward, say, to the Great River, towards Mordor, we\nmight pass the signs and never know it.\u2019\n\u2018That is true,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But if I read the signs back yonder\nrightly, the Orcs of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company\nis now bound for Isengard. Their present course bears me out.\u2019\n\u2018Yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018And what of escape? In the dark we should have passed the signs\nthat led you to the brooch.\u2019\n\u2018The Orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the\nprisoners even wearier,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018There will be no escape again,\nif we do not contrive it. How that is to be done cannot be guessed,\nbut first we must overtake them.\u2019\n\u2018And yet even I, Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy\nof my folk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause,\u2019\nsaid Gimli. \u2018My heart burns me too, and I would have started sooner;\nbut now I must rest a little to run the better. And if we rest, then\nthe blind night is the time to do so.\u2019"}
{"450": "\u2018You are our guide,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018and you are skilled in the chase.\nYou shall choose.\u2019\n\u2018My heart bids me go on,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018But we must hold\ntogether. I will follow your counsel.\u2019\n\u2018You give the choice to an ill chooser,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Since we\npassed through the Argonath my choices have gone amiss.\u2019 He fell\nsilent, gazing north and west into the gathering night for a long while.\n\u2018We will not walk in the dark,\u2019 he said at length. \u2018The peril of\nmissing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the\ngreater. If the Moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he\nsets early and is yet young and pale.\u2019\n\u2018And tonight he is shrouded anyway,\u2019 Gimli murmured. \u2018Would\nthat the Lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!\u2019\n\u2018It will be more needed where it is bestowed,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018With\nhim lies the true Quest. Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds\nof this time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no\nchoice of mine can mar or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use\nthe time as best we may!\u2019\nHe cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he\nhad not slept since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir.\nBefore dawn was in the sky he woke and rose. Gimli was still deep\nin slumber, but Legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the\ndarkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night.\n\u2018They are far far away,\u2019 he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. \u2018I know\nin my heart that they have not rested this night. Only an eagle could\novertake them now.\u2019\n\u2018Nonetheless we will still follow as we may,\u2019 said Aragorn. Stooping\nhe roused the Dwarf. \u2018Come! We must go,\u2019 he said. \u2018The scent is\ngrowing cold.\u2019\n\u2018But it is still dark,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Even Legolas on a hill-top could\nnot see them till the Sun is up.\u2019\n\u2018I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under\nmoon or sun,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018The land must groan under their hated feet.\u2019 He stretched himself\nupon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay there\nmotionless, for so long a time that Gimli wondered if he had swooned\nor fallen asleep again. Dawn came glimmering, and slowly a grey\nlight grew about them. At last he rose, and now his friends could see\nhis face: it was pale and drawn, and his look was troubled.\n\u2018The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,\u2019 he said. \u2018Nothing"}
{"451": "mind that I heard them, even as I lay on the ground in sleep, and\nthey troubled my dreams: horses galloping, passing in the West. But\nnow they are drawing ever further from us, riding northward. I\nwonder what is happening in this land!\u2019\n\u2018Let us go!\u2019 said Legolas.\nSo the third day of their pursuit began. During all its long hours\nof cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running,\nas if no weariness could quench the fire that burned them. They\nseldom spoke. Over the wide solitude they passed and their elven-\ncloaks faded against the background of the grey-green fields; even in\nthe cool sunlight of mid-day few but Elvish eyes would have marked\nthem, until they were close at hand. Often in their hearts they thanked\nthe Lady of Lo\u00b4 rien for the gift of lembas, for they could eat of it and\nfind new strength even as they ran.\nAll day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west\nwithout a break or turn. As once again the day wore to its end they\ncame to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards\na line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter\nas it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and\nthe grass shorter. Far away to the left the river Entwash wound, a\nsilver thread in a green floor. No moving thing could be seen. Often\nAragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The dwell-\nings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to\nthe South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now\nhidden in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept\nmany herds and studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their\nrealm, and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp\nand tent, even in winter-time. But now all the land was empty, and\nthere was a silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.\nAt dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had\npassed over the plains of Rohan and the wall of the Emyn Muil was\nlost in the shadows of the East. The young moon was glimmering in\na misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.\n\u2018Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase,\u2019\nsaid Legolas. \u2018The Orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of\nSauron were behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest\nand the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the\ntrees.\u2019\nGimli ground his teeth. \u2018This is a bitter end to our hope and to\nall our toil!\u2019 he said."}
{"452": "they had come towards the night gathering in the East. \u2018There is\nsomething strange at work in this land. I distrust the silence. I distrust\neven the pale Moon. The stars are faint; and I am weary as I have\nseldom been before, weary as no Ranger should be with a clear trail\nto follow. There is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets\nan unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more\nthan in the limb.\u2019\n\u2018Truly!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018That I have known since first we came down\nfrom the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.\u2019\nHe pointed away over the land of Rohan into the darkling West under\nthe sickle moon.\n\u2018Saruman!\u2019 muttered Aragorn. \u2018But he shall not turn us back! Halt\nwe must once more; for, see! even the Moon is falling into gathering\ncloud. But north lies our road between down and fen when day\nreturns.\u2019\nAs before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept.\n\u2018Awake! Awake!\u2019 he cried. \u2018It is a red dawn. Strange things await us\nby the eaves of the forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are\ncalled. Awake!\u2019\nThe others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly\nthe downs drew near. It was still an hour before noon when they\nreached them: green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in a line\nstraight towards the North. At their feet the ground was dry and the\nturf short, but a long strip of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay\nbetween them and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of reed\nand rush. Just to the West of the southernmost slope there was a great\nring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet.\nFrom it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts\nof the hills. Aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.\n\u2018They rested here a while,\u2019 he said, \u2018but even the outward trail is\nalready old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, Legolas: it is thrice\ntwelve hours, I guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If\nthey held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach\nthe borders of Fangorn.\u2019\n\u2018I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into\nmist,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?\u2019\n\u2018It is still far away,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018If I remember rightly, these\ndowns run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west\nto the issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land, another\nfifteen leagues it may be.\u2019\n\u2018Well, let us go on,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018My legs must forget the miles."}
{"453": "The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the\nline of downs. For many hours they had marched without rest. They\nwere going slowly now, and Gimli\u2019s back was bent. Stone-hard are\nthe Dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to\ntell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. Aragorn walked behind\nhim, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or\nmark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped as lightly as ever,\nhis feet hardly seeming to press the grass, leaving no footprints as he\npassed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found all the sustenance\nthat he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by\nMen, resting his mind in the strange paths of Elvish dreams, even as\nhe walked open-eyed in the light of this world.\n\u2018Let us go up on to this green hill!\u2019 he said. Wearily they followed\nhim, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. It was\na round hill smooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of\nthe downs. The sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a\ncurtain. They were alone in a grey formless world without mark or\nmeasure. Only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness\nagainst the dying light: the Mountains of Mist and the forest at their\nfeet.\n\u2018Nothing can we see to guide us here,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Well, now we\nmust halt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!\u2019\n\u2018The wind is north from the snows,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018And ere morning it will be in the East,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018But rest,\nif you must. Yet do not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown.\nRede oft is found at the rising of the Sun.\u2019\n\u2018Three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no\ncounsel,\u2019 said Gimli.\nThe night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and\nwhenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or\nwalking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and\nas he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So\nthe night passed. Together they watched the dawn grow slowly in\nthe sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sunrise came. It was\npale and clear. The wind was in the East and all the mists had rolled\naway; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.\nAhead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of\nRohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great\nRiver. North-westward stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten\nleagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded\nintothedistantblue.Beyondthereglimmeredfaraway,asiffloating"}
{"454": "them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven.\nThe orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.\nFollowing with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the\nriver back towards the forest, Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant\ngreen, a dark swift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground\nand listened again intently. But Legolas stood beside him, shading\nhis bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a\nshadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horse-\nmen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the\ntwinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. Far behind\nthem a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.\nThere was a silence in the empty fields, and Gimli could hear the\nair moving in the grass.\n\u2018Riders!\u2019 cried Aragorn, springing to his feet. \u2018Many riders on swift\nsteeds are coming towards us!\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018there are one hundred and five. Yellow is\ntheir hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.\u2019\nAragorn smiled. \u2018Keen are the eyes of the Elves,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Nay! The riders are little more than five leagues distant,\u2019 said\nLegolas.\n\u2018Five leagues or one,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018we cannot escape them in this\nbare land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?\u2019\n\u2018We will wait,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018I am weary, and our hunt has failed.\nOr at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back\ndown the orc-trail. We may get news from them.\u2019\n\u2018Or spears,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018I did not say that we should hear good news,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But\nevil or good we will await it here.\u2019\nThe three companions now left the hill-top, where they might\nbe an easy mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down\nthe northward slope. A little above the hill\u2019s foot they halted, and\nwrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon\nthe faded grass. The time passed slowly and heavily. The wind was\nthin and searching. Gimli was uneasy.\n\u2018What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?\u2019 he said. \u2018Do we\nsit here waiting for sudden death?\u2019\n\u2018I have been among them,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018They are proud\nand wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed;\nbold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing\nmany songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark\nYears.

At least they will\nnot love the Orcs.\u2019\n\u2018But Gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor,\u2019\nsaid Gimli.\n\u2018I believe it no more than did Boromir,\u2019 answered Aragorn.\n\u2018You will soon learn the truth,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Already they\napproach.\u2019\nAt length even Gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs.\nThe horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and\nwere drawing near the downs. They were riding like the wind.\nNow the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields.\nSuddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost\nhorseman swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the\nhost back southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him\nthey rode: a long line of mail-clad men, swift, shining, fell and fair\nto look upon.\nTheir horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their\ngrey coats glistened, their long tails flowed in the wind, their manes\nwere braided on their proud necks. The Men that rode them matched\nthem well: tall and long-limbed; their hair, flaxen-pale, flowed under\ntheir light helms, and streamed in long braids behind them; their\nfaces were stern and keen. In their hands were tall spears of ash,\npainted shields were slung at their backs, long swords were at their\nbelts, their burnished shirts of mail hung down upon their knees.\nIn pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then one\nrose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared\nnot to perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them.\nThe host had almost passed when suddenly Aragorn stood up, and\ncalled in a loud voice:\n\u2018What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?\u2019\nWith astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds,\nwheeled, and came charging round. Soon the three companions\nfound themselves in a ring of horsemen moving in a running circle,\nup the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them,\nand drawing ever inwards. Aragorn stood silent, and the other two\nsat without moving, wondering what way things would turn."}

Aragorn did not\nstir.\n\u2018Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?\u2019 said the Rider,\nusing the Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like to\nthe speech of Boromir, Man of Gondor.\n\u2018I am called Strider,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018I came out of the North.\nI am hunting Orcs.\u2019\nThe Rider leaped from his horse. Giving his spear to another who\nrode up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood\nface to face with Aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without\nwonder. At length he spoke again.\n\u2018At first I thought that you yourselves were Orcs,\u2019 he said; \u2018but\nnow I see that it is not so. Indeed you know little of Orcs, if you go\nhunting them in this fashion. They were swift and well-armed, and\nthey were many. You would have changed from hunters to prey, if\never you had overtaken them. But there is something strange about\nyou, Strider.\u2019 He bent his clear bright eyes again upon the Ranger.\n\u2018That is no name for a Man that you give. And strange too is your\nraiment. Have you sprung out of the grass? How did you escape our\nsight? Are you Elvish folk?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018One only of us is an Elf, Legolas from the\nWoodland Realm in distant Mirkwood. But we have passed through\nLothlo\u00b4 rien, and the gifts and favour of the Lady go with us.\u2019\nThe Rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes\nhardened. \u2018Then there is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales\ntell!\u2019 he said. \u2018Few escape her nets, they say. These are strange days!\nBut if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and\nsorcerers, maybe.\u2019 He turned a cold glance suddenly upon Legolas\nand Gimli. \u2018Why do you not speak, silent ones?\u2019 he demanded.\nGimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the\nhandle of his axe, and his dark eyes flashed. \u2018Give me your name,\nhorse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018As for that,\u2019 said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, \u2018the\nstranger should declare himself first. Yet I am named E\u00b4 omer son of\nE\u00b4 omund, and am called the Third Marshal of Riddermark.\u2019\n\u2018Then E\u00b4omer son of E\u00b4 omund, Third Marshal of Riddermark, let\nGimli the Dwarf Glo\u00b4 in\u2019s son warn you against foolish words. You\nspeak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and\nonly little wit can excuse you.\u2019"}

We intend no evil to Rohan, nor\nto any of its folk, neither to man nor to horse. Will you not hear our\ntale before you strike?\u2019\n\u2018I will,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer lowering his blade. \u2018But wanderers in the\nRiddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt.\nFirst tell me your right name.\u2019\n\u2018First tell me whom you serve,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Are you friend or\nfoe of Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?\u2019\n\u2018I serve only the Lord of the Mark, The\u00b4oden King son of Thengel,\u2019\nanswered E\u00b4 omer. \u2018We do not serve the Power of the Black Land far\naway, but neither are we yet at open war with him; and if you are\nfleeing from him, then you had best leave this land. There is trouble\nnow on all our borders, and we are threatened; but we desire only\nto be free, and to live as we have lived, keeping our own, and serving\nno foreign lord, good or evil. We welcomed guests kindly in the better\ndays, but in these times the unbidden stranger finds us swift and\nhard. Come! Who are you? Whom do you serve? At whose command\ndo you hunt Orcs in our land?\u2019\n\u2018I serve no man,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018but the servants of Sauron I pursue\ninto whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men\nwho know more of Orcs; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out\nof choice. The Orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends.\nIn such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he will\nnot ask for leave to follow the trail. Nor will he count the heads of\nthe enemy save with a sword. I am not weaponless.\u2019\nAragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he\ngrasped it, and the bright blade of Andu\u00b4 ril shone like a sudden\nflame as he swept it out. \u2018Elendil!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I am Aragorn son of\nArathorn, and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Du\u00b4nadan, the heir\nof Isildur Elendil\u2019s son of Gondor.

{"458": "moment it seemed to the eyes of Legolas that a white flame flickered\non the brows of Aragorn like a shining crown.\nE\u00b4 omer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast\ndown his proud eyes. \u2018These are indeed strange days,\u2019 he muttered.\n\u2018Dreams and legends spring to life out of the grass.\n\u2018Tell me, lord,\u2019 he said, \u2018what brings you here? And what was the\nmeaning of the dark words? Long has Boromir son of Denethor been\ngone seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back\nriderless. What doom do you bring out of the North?\u2019\n\u2018The doom of choice,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018You may say this to The\u00b4oden\nson of Thengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against\nhim. None may live now as they have lived, and few shall keep what\nthey call their own. But of these great matters we will speak later. If\nchance allows, I will come myself to the king. Now I am in great\nneed, and I ask for help, or at least for tidings. You heard that we\nare pursuing an orc-host that carried off our friends. What can you\ntell us?\u2019\n\u2018That you need not pursue them further,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018The Orcs\nare destroyed.\u2019\n\u2018And our friends?\u2019\n\u2018We found none but Orcs.\u2019\n\u2018But that is strange indeed,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Did you search the\nslain? Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would\nbe small, only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.\u2019\n\u2018There were no dwarves nor children,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018We counted\nall the slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and\nburned them, as is our custom. The ashes are smoking still.\u2019\n\u2018We do not speak of dwarves or children,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Our friends\nwere hobbits.\u2019\n\u2018Hobbits?\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018And what may they be? It is a strange\nname.\u2019\n\u2018A strange name for a strange folk,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But these were\nvery dear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words\nthat troubled Minas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits\nare Halflings.\u2019\n\u2018Halflings!\u2019 laughed the Rider that stood beside E\u00b4omer. \u2018Halflings!\nBut they are only a little people in old songs and children\u2019s tales out\nof the North. Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the\ndaylight?\u2019\n\u2018A man may do both,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018For not we but those who\ncome after will make the legends of our time.

Or\nlet us bind them and take them to the king.\u2019\n\u2018Peace, E\u00b4othain!\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer in his own tongue. \u2018Leave me a while.\nTell the e\u00b4ored to assemble on the path, and make ready to ride to the\nEntwade.\u2019\nMuttering E\u00b4othain retired, and spoke to the others. Soon they\ndrew off and left E\u00b4omer alone with the three companions.\n\u2018All that you say is strange, Aragorn,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yet you speak the\ntruth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore\nthey are not easily deceived. But you have not told all. Will you not\nnow speak more fully of your errand, so that I may judge what to\ndo?\u2019\n\u2018I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks\nago,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith.\nMy errand was to go to that city with the son of Denethor, to aid\nhis folk in their war against Sauron. But the Company that I journeyed\nwith had other business. Of that I cannot speak now. Gandalf the\nGrey was our leader.\u2019\n\u2018Gandalf !\u2019 E\u00b4omer exclaimed. \u2018Gandalf Greyhame is known in the\nMark; but his name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king\u2019s\nfavour. He has been a guest in the land many times in the memory\nof men, coming as he will, after a season, or after many years. He is\never the herald of strange events: a bringer of evil, some now say.\n\u2018Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone\namiss. At that time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we\ncounted Saruman our friend, but Gandalf came then and warned us\nthat sudden war was preparing in Isengard. He said that he himself\nhad been a prisoner in Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and he\nbegged for help. But The\u00b4oden would not listen to him, and he went\naway. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in The\u00b4oden\u2019s ears! He\nis wroth. For Gandalf took the horse that is called Shadowfax, the\nmost precious of all the king\u2019s steeds, chief of the Mearas, which only\nthe Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the\ngreat horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven nights ago\nShadowfax returned; but the king\u2019s anger is not less, for now the\nhorse is wild and will let no man handle him.\u2019\n\u2018Then Shadowfax has found his way alone from the far North,\u2019\nsaid Aragorn; \u2018for it was there that he and Gandalf parted. But alas!\nGandalf will ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines of\nMoria and comes not again.\u2019\n\u2018That is heavy tidings,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018At least to me, and to many;"}
{"460": "though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,\u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018But when the great fall, the less must lead. My part it has\nbeen to guide our Company on the long road from Moria. Through\nLo\u00b4 rien we came \u2013 of which it were well that you should learn the\ntruth ere you speak of it again \u2013 and thence down the leagues of\nthe Great River to the falls of Rauros. There Boromir was slain by\nthe same Orcs whom you destroyed.\u2019\n\u2018Your news is all of woe!\u2019 cried E\u00b4omer in dismay. \u2018Great harm is\nthis death to Minas Tirith, and to us all. That was a worthy man!\nAll spoke his praise. He came seldom to the Mark, for he was ever\nin the wars on the East-borders; but I have seen him. More like to\nthe swift sons of Eorl than to the grave Men of Gondor he seemed\nto me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time\ncame. But we have had no word of this grief out of Gondor. When\ndid he fall?\u2019\n\u2018It is now the fourth day since he was slain,\u2019 answered Aragorn;\n\u2018and since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow\nof Tol Brandir.\u2019\n\u2018On foot?\u2019 cried E\u00b4 omer.\n\u2018Yes, even as you see us.\u2019\nWide wonder came into E\u00b4 omer\u2019s eyes. \u2018Strider is too poor a name,\nson of Arathorn,\u2019 he said. \u2018Wingfoot I name you. This deed of the\nthree friends should be sung in many a hall. Forty leagues and five\nyou have measured ere the fourth day is ended! Hardy is the race of\nElendil!\n\u2018But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in\nhaste to The\u00b4oden. I spoke warily before my men. It is true that we\nare not yet at open war with the Black Land, and there are some,\nclose to the king\u2019s ear, that speak craven counsels; but war is coming.\nWe shall not forsake our old alliance with Gondor, and while they\nfight we shall aid them: so say I and all who hold with me. The\nEast-mark is my charge, the ward of the Third Marshal, and I have\nremoved all our herds and herdfolk, withdrawing them beyond\nEntwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.\u2019\n\u2018Then you do not pay tribute to Sauron?\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018We do not and we never have,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer with a flash of his\neyes; \u2018though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. Some\nyears ago the Lord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of\nus at great price, but we refused him, for he puts beasts to evil use.\nThen he sent plundering Orcs, and they carry off what they can,\nchoosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. For that\nreason our feud with the Orcs is bitter."}
{"461": "many months. He has taken Orcs into his service, and Wolf-riders,\nand evil Men, and he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are\nlikely to be beset both east and west.\n\u2018It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and\ndwimmer-crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they\nsay, as an old man hooded and cloaked, very like to Gandalf, as many\nnow recall. His spies slip through every net, and his birds of ill omen\nare abroad in the sky. I do not know how it will all end, and my\nheart misgives me; for it seems to me that his friends do not all dwell\nin Isengard. But if you come to the king\u2019s house, you shall see for\nyourself. Will you not come? Do I hope in vain that you have been\nsent to me for a help in doubt and need?\u2019\n\u2018I will come when I may,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Come now!\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018The Heir of Elendil would be a strength\nindeed to the Sons of Eorl in this evil tide. There is battle even now\nupon the Westemnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us.\n\u2018Indeed in this riding north I went without the king\u2019s leave, for in\nmy absence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me\nof the orc-host coming down out of the East Wall four nights ago,\nand among them they reported that some bore the white badges of\nSaruman. So suspecting what I most fear, a league between Orthanc\nand the Dark Tower, I led forth my e\u00b4ored, men of my own household;\nand we overtook the Orcs at nightfall two days ago, near to the\nborders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and gave battle\nyesterday at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses alas!\nFor the Orcs were greater in number than we counted on. Others\njoined them, coming out of the East across the Great River: their\ntrail is plain to see a little north of this spot. And others, too, came\nout of the forest. Great Orcs, who also bore the White Hand of\nIsengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all others.\n\u2018Nonetheless we put an end to them. But we have been too long\naway. We are needed south and west. Will you not come? There are\nspare horses as you see. There is work for the Sword to do. Yes, and\nwe could find a use for Gimli\u2019s axe and the bow of Legolas, if they\nwill pardon my rash words concerning the Lady of the Wood. I spoke\nonly as do all men in my land, and I would gladly learn better.\u2019\n\u2018I thank you for your fair words,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018and my heart\ndesires to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope\nremains.\u2019\n\u2018Hope does not remain,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018You will not find your\nfriends on the North-borders.\u2019\n\u2018Yet my friends are not behind. We found a clear token not far"}
{"462": "them, and no trail has turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill\nhas wholly left me.\u2019\n\u2018Then what do you think has become of them?\u2019\n\u2018I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the\nOrcs; but that you will say cannot be, and I do not fear it. I can only\nthink that they were carried off into the forest before the battle, even\nbefore you encircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that none\nescaped your net in such a way?\u2019\n\u2018I would swear that no Orc escaped after we sighted them,\u2019 said\nE\u00b4 omer. \u2018We reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that\nany living thing broke through our ring, then it was no Orc and had\nsome Elvish power.\u2019\n\u2018Our friends were attired even as we are,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018and you\npassed us by under the full light of day.\u2019\n\u2018I had forgotten that,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018It is hard to be sure of anything\namong so many marvels. The world is all grown strange. Elf and\nDwarf in company walk in our daily fields; and folk speak with the\nLady of the Wood and yet live; and the Sword comes back to war\nthat was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode\ninto the Mark! How shall a man judge what to do in such times?\u2019\n\u2018As he ever has judged,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Good and ill have not\nchanged since yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and\nDwarves and another among Men. It is a man\u2019s part to discern them,\nas much in the Golden Wood as in his own house.\u2019\n\u2018True indeed,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018But I do not doubt you, nor the deed\nwhich my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It\nis against our law to let strangers wander at will in our land, until\nthe king himself shall give them leave, and more strict is the command\nin these days of peril. I have begged you to come back willingly with\nme, and you will not. Loth am I to begin a battle of one hundred\nagainst three.\u2019\n\u2018I do not think your law was made for such a chance,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Nor indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more\nthan once, and ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under\nother name and in other guise. You I have not seen before, for you\nare young, but I have spoken with E\u00b4omund your father, and with\nThe\u00b4oden son of Thengel. Never in former days would any high lord\nof this land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine.\nMy duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now, son of E\u00b4omund, the\nchoice must be made at last. Aid us, or at the worst let us go free.\nOr seek to carry out your law. If you do so there will be fewer to\nreturn to your war or to your king.\u2019"}
{"463": "hour lessens your hope. This is my choice. You may go; and what\nis more, I will lend you horses. This only I ask: when your quest is\nachieved, or is proved vain, return with the horses over the Entwade\nto Meduseld, the high house in Edoras where The\u00b4oden now sits.\nThus you shall prove to him that I have not misjudged. In this I\nplace myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of your good\nfaith. Do not fail.\u2019\n\u2018I will not,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nThere was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances,\namong his men, when E\u00b4omer gave orders that the spare horses were\nto be lent to the strangers; but only E\u00b4 othain dared to speak openly.\n\u2018It may be well enough for this lord of the race of Gondor, as he\nclaims,\u2019 he said, \u2018but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being\ngiven to a Dwarf ?\u2019\n\u2018No one,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018And do not trouble: no one will ever hear\nof it. I would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great,\nfree or begrudged.\u2019\n\u2018But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Come, you shall sit behind me, friend Gimli,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Then\nall will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled\nby one.\u2019\nA great dark-grey horse was brought to Aragorn, and he mounted\nit. \u2018Hasufel is his name,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018May he bear you well and to\nbetter fortune than Ga\u00b4rulf, his late master!\u2019\nA smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to\nLegolas. Arod was his name. But Legolas asked them to take off\nsaddle and rein. \u2018I need them not,\u2019 he said, and leaped lightly up,\nand to their wonder Arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving\nhere and there with but a spoken word: such was the Elvish way with\nall good beasts. Gimli was lifted up behind his friend, and he clung\nto him, not much more at ease than Sam Gamgee in a boat.\n\u2018Farewell, and may you find what you seek!\u2019 cried E\u00b4omer. \u2018Return\nwith what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine\ntogether!\u2019\n\u2018I will come,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018And I will come, too,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018The matter of the Lady Galadriel\nlies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech.\u2019\n\u2018We shall see,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018So many strange things have chanced\nthat to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a\nDwarf \u2019s axe will seem no great wonder.

{"464": "small and far away. Aragorn did not look back: he was watching the\ntrail as they sped on their way, bending low with his head beside the\nneck of Hasufel. Before long they came to the borders of the Entwash,\nand there they met the other trail of which E\u00b4omer had spoken, coming\ndown from the East out of the Wold.\nAragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back\ninto the saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping\nto one side and taking care not to override the footprints. Then he\nagain dismounted and examined the ground, going backwards and\nforwards on foot.\n\u2018There is little to discover,\u2019 he said when he returned. \u2018The main\ntrail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came\nback; their outward course must have lain nearer the river. But this\neastward trail is fresh and clear. There is no sign there of any feet\ngoing the other way, back towards Anduin. Now we must ride slower,\nand make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side.\nThe Orcs must have been aware from this point that they were pur-\nsued; they may have made some attempt to get their captives away\nbefore they were overtaken.\u2019\nAs they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came\nover the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad\nslopes of Fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west.\nThey saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they\npassed single Orcs, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-\nfeathered arrows sticking in back or throat.\nAt last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the\nforest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the\nplace of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking.\nBeside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and\nbroken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake\nin the middle was set a great goblin head; upon its shattered helm\nthe white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the\nriver, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there\nwas a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with\nfresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears.\nAragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the\nfield of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim\nand misty. By nightfall they had discovered no trace of Merry and\nPippin.\n\u2018We can do no more,\u2019 said Gimli sadly. \u2018We have been set many\nriddles since we came to Tol Brandir, but this is the hardest to"}
{"465": "hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell.

But I shall not depart from this place yet. In any case we must\nhere await the morning-light.\u2019\nA little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under\na spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many\nbroad brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed\nfingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.\nGimli shivered. They had brought only one blanket apiece. \u2018Let\nus light a fire,\u2019 he said. \u2018I care no longer for the danger. Let the Orcs\ncome as thick as summer-moths round a candle!\u2019\n\u2018If those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw\nthem hither,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018And it might draw other things, neither Orc nor Hobbit,\u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018We are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor\nSaruman. Also we are on the very edge of Fangorn, and it is perilous\nto touch the trees of that wood, it is said.\u2019\n\u2018But the Rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,\u2019 said\nGimli, \u2018and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. Yet they\npassed the night after safely here, when their labour was ended.\u2019\n\u2018They were many,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018and they do not heed the wrath\nof Fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under\nthe trees. But our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself.\nSo have a care! Cut no living wood!\u2019\n\u2018There is no need,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018The Riders have left chip and\nbough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.\u2019 He went off\nto gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire;\nbut Aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought;\nand Legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound\nshadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices\ncalling from a distance.\nWhen the Dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three com-\npanions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with\ntheir hooded forms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree\nreaching out above them."}
{"466": "certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bend-\ning this way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper\nbranches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff,\nand rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in\nthe warmth.\nThere was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest,\nso near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of\nsecret purpose. After a while Legolas spoke again.\n\u2018Celeborn warned us not to go far into Fangorn,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do you\nknow why, Aragorn? What are the fables of the forest that Boromir\nhad heard?\u2019\n\u2018I have heard many tales in Gondor and elsewhere,\u2019 said Aragorn,\n\u2018but if it were not for the words of Celeborn I should deem them\nonly fables that Men have made as true knowledge fades. I had\nthought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. And if an\nElf of the wood does not know, how shall a Man answer?\u2019\n\u2018You have journeyed further than I,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I have heard\nnothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the\nOnodrim, that Men call Ents, dwelt there long ago; for Fangorn is\nold, old even as the Elves would reckon it.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, it is old,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018as old as the forest by the Barrow-\ndowns, and it is far greater. Elrond says that the two are akin, the\nlast strongholds of the mighty woods of the Elder Days, in which the\nFirstborn roamed while Men still slept. Yet Fangorn holds some\nsecret of its own. What it is I do not know.\u2019\n\u2018And I do not wish to know,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Let nothing that dwells\nin Fangorn be troubled on my account!\u2019\nThey now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch\nfell to Gimli. The others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold\non them. \u2018Gimli!\u2019 said Aragorn drowsily. \u2018Remember, it is perilous\nto cut bough or twig from a living tree in Fangorn. But do not stray\nfar in search of dead wood. Let the fire die rather! Call me at need!\u2019\nWith that he fell asleep. Legolas already lay motionless, his fair\nhands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night\nand deep dream, as is the way with Elves. Gimli sat hunched by the\nfire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The\ntree rustled. There was no other sound.\nSuddenly Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the\nfirelight stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in\na great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes.\nGimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at\nonce the thought flashed into his mind that Saruman had caught"}
{"467": "\u2018Well, father, what can we do for you?\u2019 said Aragorn, leaping to\nhis feet. \u2018Come and be warm, if you are cold!\u2019 He strode forward,\nbut the old man was gone. There was no trace of him to be found\nnear at hand, and they did not dare to wander far. The moon had\nset and the night was very dark.\nSuddenly Legolas gave a cry. \u2018The horses! The horses!\u2019\nThe horses were gone. They had dragged their pickets and dis-\nappeared. For some time the three companions stood still and silent,\ntroubled by this new stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves\nof Fangorn, and endless leagues lay between them and the Men of\nRohan, their only friends in this wide and dangerous land. As they\nstood, it seemed to them that they heard, far off in the night, the\nsound of horses whinnying and neighing. Then all was quiet again,\nexcept for the cold rustle of the wind.\n\u2018Well, they are gone,\u2019 said Aragorn at last. \u2018We cannot find them\nor catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we\nmust do without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.\u2019\n\u2018Feet!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But we cannot eat them as well as walk on\nthem.\u2019 He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.\n\u2018Only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of\nRohan,\u2019 laughed Legolas. \u2018You will make a rider yet.\u2019\n\u2018It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018If you wish to know what I think,\u2019 he began again after a while,\n\u2018I think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember the words of E\u00b4 omer:\nhe walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were the\nwords. He has gone off with our horses, or scared them away, and\nhere we are. There is more trouble coming to us, mark my words!\u2019\n\u2018I mark them,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But I marked also that this old man\nhad a hat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess right, and\nthat we are in peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there\nis nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. I will watch for a\nwhile now, Gimli. I have more need of thought than of sleep.\u2019\nThe night passed slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli\nfollowed Legolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing hap-\npened. The old man did not appear again, and the horses did not\nreturn."}
{"468": "Chapter 3\nTHE URUK-HAI\nPippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could\nhear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling Frodo,\nFrodo! But instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned\nat him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him\nfrom every side. Where was Merry?\nHe woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back.\nEvening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. He turned\nand found that the dream was little worse than the waking. His\nwrists, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. Beside him Merry lay,\nwhite-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. All about them\nsat or stood a great company of Orcs.\nSlowly in Pippin\u2019s aching head memory pieced itself together and\nbecame separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and Merry\nhad run off into the woods. What had come over them? Why had\nthey dashed off like that, taking no notice of old Strider? They had\nrun a long way shouting \u2013 he could not remember how far or how\nlong; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of Orcs:\nthey were standing listening, and they did not appear to see Merry\nand Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled\nand dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. Merry and\nhe had drawn their swords, but the Orcs did not wish to fight, and\nhad tried only to lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off\nseveral of their arms and hands. Good old Merry!\nThen Boromir had come leaping through the trees. He had made\nthem fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled. But they had\nnot gone far on the way back when they were attacked again, by a\nhundred Orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain\nof arrows: always at Boromir. Boromir had blown his great horn till\nthe woods rang, and at first the Orcs had been dismayed and had\ndrawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had\nattacked more fiercely than ever. Pippin did not remember much\nmore. His last memory was of Boromir leaning against a tree, plucking\nout an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.\n\u2018I suppose I was knocked on the head,\u2019 he said to himself. \u2018I\nwonder if poor Merry is much hurt.

{"469": "\u2018What good have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of\nluggage. And now I have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggage\nfor the Orcs. I hope Strider or someone will come and claim us! But\nought I to hope for it? Won\u2019t that throw out all the plans? I wish I\ncould get free!\u2019\nHe struggled a little, quite uselessly. One of the Orcs sitting near\nlaughed and said something to a companion in their abominable\ntongue. \u2018Rest while you can, little fool!\u2019 he said then to Pippin, in\nthe Common Speech, which he made almost as hideous as his own\nlanguage. \u2018Rest while you can! We\u2019ll find a use for your legs before\nlong. You\u2019ll wish you had got none before we get home.\u2019\n\u2018If I had my way, you\u2019d wish you were dead now,\u2019 said the other.\n\u2018I\u2019d make you squeak, you miserable rat.\u2019 He stooped over Pippin,\nbringing his yellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with\na long jagged blade in his hand. \u2018Lie quiet, or I\u2019ll tickle you with\nthis,\u2019 he hissed. \u2018Don\u2019t draw attention to yourself, or I may forget\nmy orders.

Uglu\u00b4k u bagronk sha pushdug\nSaruman-glob bu\u00b4bhosh skai\u2019: he passed into a long angry speech in his\nown tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.\nTerrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles\nwas growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his\nback. To take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that\nhe could hear. There were many voices round about, and though\norc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed\nplain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was getting\nhotter.\nTo Pippin\u2019s surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible;\nmany of the Orcs were using ordinary language. Apparently the\nmembers of two or three quite different tribes were present, and they\ncould not understand one another\u2019s orc-speech. There was an angry\ndebate concerning what they were to do now: which way they were\nto take and what should be done with the prisoners.\n\u2018There\u2019s no time to kill them properly,\u2019 said one. \u2018No time for\nplay on this trip.\u2019\n\u2018That can\u2019t be helped,\u2019 said another. \u2018But why not kill them quick,\nkill them now?

The prisoners are\nnot to be searched or plundered: those are my orders.\u2019\n\u2018And mine too,\u2019 said the deep voice. \u2018Alive and as captured; no\nspoiling. That\u2019s my orders.\u2019\n\u2018Not our orders!\u2019 said one of the earlier voices. \u2018We have come all\nthe way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill,\nand then go back north.\u2019\n\u2018Then you can wish again,\u2019 said the growling voice. \u2018I am Uglu\u00b4k.\nI command. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.\u2019\n\u2018Is Saruman the master or the Great Eye?\u2019 said the evil voice. \u2018We\nshould go back at once to Lugbu\u00b4rz.\u2019\n\u2018If we could cross the Great River, we might,\u2019 said another voice.\n\u2018But there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.\u2019\n\u2018I came across,\u2019 said the evil voice. \u2018A winged Nazgu\u02c6l awaits us\nnorthward on the east-bank.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe, maybe! Then you\u2019ll fly off with our prisoners, and get all\nthe pay and praise in Lugbu\u00b4 rz, and leave us to foot it as best we can\nthrough the Horse-country. No, we must stick together. These lands\nare dangerous: full of foul rebels and brigands.\u2019\n\u2018Aye, we must stick together,\u2019 growled Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018I don\u2019t trust you\nlittle swine. You\u2019ve no guts outside your own sties. But for us you\u2019d\nall have run away. We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We slew the great\nwarrior. We took the prisoners.

They might think\nthat Uglu\u00b4k\u2019s shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. They\nmight ask where his strange ideas came from. Did they come from\nSaruman, perhaps?

They might agree with me, with Grish-\nna\u00b4kh their trusted messenger; and I Grishna\u00b4kh say this: Saruman is\na fool, and a dirty treacherous fool.

{"471": "the twilight he saw a large black Orc, probably Uglu\u00b4k, standing facing\nGrishna\u00b4kh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long\narms that hung almost to the ground. Round them were many smaller\ngoblins. Pippin supposed that these were the ones from the North.\nThey had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack\nUglu\u00b4k.\nUglu\u00b4 k shouted, and a number of other Orcs of nearly his own size\nran up. Then suddenly, without warning, Uglu\u00b4 k sprang forwards,\nand with two swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents.\nGrishna\u00b4kh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. The others\ngave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over Merry\u2019s prostrate\nform with a curse. Yet that probably saved his life, for Uglu\u00b4 k\u2019s fol-\nlowers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed\nswords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His body fell right on top of\nPippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.\n\u2018Put up your weapons!\u2019 shouted Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018And let\u2019s have no more\nnonsense! We go straight west from here, and down the stair. From\nthere straight to the downs, then along the river to the forest. And\nwe march day and night. That clear?\u2019\n\u2018Now,\u2019 thought Pippin, \u2018if only it takes that ugly fellow a little\nwhile to get his troop under control, I\u2019ve got a chance.\u2019 A gleam of\nhope had come to him. The edge of the black knife had snicked his\narm, and then slid down to his wrist. He felt the blood trickling\non to his hand, but he also felt the cold touch of steel against his\nskin.\nThe Orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the\nNortherners were still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more\nbefore the rest were cowed. There was much cursing and confusion.\nFor the moment Pippin was unwatched. His legs were securely\nbound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands\nwere in front of him. He could move them both together, though the\nbonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Orc to one side, then\nhardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and\ndown against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand\nheld it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers\nand knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it\nover his hands. Then he lay very still.\n\u2018Pick up those prisoners!\u2019 shouted Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018Don\u2019t play any tricks\nwith them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will\ndie too.\u2019\nAn Orc seized Pippin like a sack, put its head between his tied"}
{"472": "treated Merry in the same way. The Orc\u2019s clawlike hand gripped\nPippin\u2019s arms like iron; the nails bit into him. He shut his eyes and\nslipped back into evil dreams.\nSuddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early\nnight, but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were\non the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist.\nThere was a sound of water falling nearby.\n\u2018The scouts have come back at last,\u2019 said an Orc close at hand.\n\u2018Well, what did you discover?\u2019 growled the voice of Uglu\u00b4 k.\n\u2018Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All\u2019s clear\nnow.\u2019\n\u2018Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot\nhim. He\u2019ll raise the alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us\nby morning. Now we\u2019ll have to leg it double quick.\u2019\nA shadow bent over Pippin. It was Uglu\u00b4 k. \u2018Sit up!\u2019 said the Orc.\n\u2018My lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down,\nand you must use your legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying\nto escape. We have ways of paying for tricks that you won\u2019t like,\nthough they won\u2019t spoil your usefulness for the Master.\u2019\nHe cut the thongs round Pippin\u2019s legs and ankles, picked him up\nby his hair and stood him on his feet. Pippin fell down, and Uglu\u00b4k\ndragged him up by his hair again. Several Orcs laughed. Uglu\u00b4 k thrust\na flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his\nthroat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. The pain in his\nlegs and ankles vanished. He could stand.\n\u2018Now for the other!\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k. Pippin saw him go to Merry, who\nwas lying close by, and kick him. Merry groaned. Seizing him roughly\nUglu\u00b4k pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off\nhis head. Then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of\na small wooden box. Merry cried out and struggled wildly.\nThe Orcs clapped and hooted. \u2018Can\u2019t take his medicine,\u2019 they\njeered. \u2018Doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. Ai! We shall have some\nfun later.\u2019\nBut at the moment Uglu\u00b4k was not engaged in sport. He needed\nspeed and had to humour unwilling followers. He was healing Merry\nin orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced\na drink from his flask down the hobbit\u2019s throat, cut his leg-bonds,\nand dragged him to his feet, Merry stood up, looking pale but grim\nand defiant, and very much alive. The gash in his forehead gave\nhim no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the end of his\ndays.\n\u2018Hullo, Pippin!\u2019he said.\u2018So you\u2019vecome onthis littleexpedition,"}
{"473": "talk to one another. Any trouble will be reported at the other end,\nand He\u2019ll know how to pay you. You\u2019ll get bed and breakfast all\nright: more than you can stomach.\u2019\nThe orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into\nthe misty plain below. Merry and Pippin, separated by a dozen Orcs\nor more, climbed down with them. At the bottom they stepped on\nto grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.\n\u2018Now straight on!\u2019 shouted Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018West and a little north. Follow\nLugdush.\u2019\n\u2018But what are we going to do at sunrise?\u2019 said some of the North-\nerners.\n\u2018Go on running,\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018What do you think? Sit on the grass\nand wait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?\u2019\n\u2018But we can\u2019t run in the sunlight.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll run with me behind you,\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018Run! Or you\u2019ll never\nsee your beloved holes again. By the White Hand! What\u2019s the use of\nsending out mountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. Run,\ncurse you! Run while night lasts!\u2019\nThen the whole company began to run with the long loping strides\nof Orcs. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their\nspeed was very great. Each hobbit had a guard of three. Pippin was\nfar back in the line. He wondered how long he would be able to go\non at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. One of his\nguards had a whip. But at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him.\nHis wits, too, were wide-awake.\nEvery now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision\nof the keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and running,\nrunning behind. But what could even a Ranger see except a confused\ntrail of orc-feet? His own little prints and Merry\u2019s were overwhelmed\nby the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them\nand about them.\nThey had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land\nsloped down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was\nsoft and wet. Mist lay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the\nsickle moon. The dark shapes of the Orcs in front grew dim, and\nthen were swallowed up.\n\u2018Ai! Steady now!\u2019 shouted Uglu\u00b4k from the rear.\nA sudden thought leaped into Pippin\u2019s mind, and he acted on it\nat once. He swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the reach of\nhis clutching guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on\nthe grass."}
{"474": "and ran. But the Orcs were after him. Some suddenly loomed up\nright in front of him.\n\u2018No hope of escape!\u2019 thought Pippin. \u2018But there is a hope that I\nhave left some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground.\u2019 He\ngroped with his two tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the\nbrooch of his cloak. Just as long arms and hard claws seized him, he\nlet it fall. \u2018There I suppose it will lie until the end of time,\u2019 he thought.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know why I did it. If the others have escaped, they\u2019ve probably\nall gone with Frodo.\u2019\nA whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.\n\u2018Enough!\u2019 shouted Uglu\u00b4k running up. \u2018He\u2019s still got to run a long\nway yet. Make \u2019em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.\u2019\n\u2018But that\u2019s not all,\u2019 he snarled, turning to Pippin. \u2018I shan\u2019t forget.\nPayment is only put off. Leg it!\u2019\nNeither Pippin nor Merry remembered much of the later part of\nthe journey. Evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long\ntunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. They ran,\nand they ran, striving to keep up the pace set by the Orcs, licked\nevery now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. If they\nhalted or stumbled, they were seized and dragged for some distance.\nThe warmth of the orc-draught had gone. Pippin felt cold and\nsick again. Suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands\nwith rending nails gripped and lifted him. He was carried like a sack\nonce more, and darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of\nanother night, or a blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.\nDimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that many\nof the Orcs were demanding a halt. Uglu\u00b4k was shouting. He felt\nhimself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams\ntook him. But he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron grip\nof merciless hands was on him again. For a long time he was tossed\nand shaken, and then slowly the darkness gave way, and he came\nback to the waking world and found that it was morning. Orders\nwere shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.\nThere he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but\nfrom the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another\ndraught. An Orc stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a\nstrip of raw dried flesh. He ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not\nthe meat. He was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung\nto him by an Orc, the flesh of he dared not guess what creature.\nHe sat up and looked about. Merry was not far away.

{"475": "There was much shouting and debating among the Orcs; a quarrel\nseemed on the point of breaking out again between the Northerners\nand the Isengarders. Some were pointing back away south, and some\nwere pointing eastward.\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018Leave them to me then! No killing, as\nI\u2019ve told you before; but if you want to throw away what we\u2019ve come\nall the way to get, throw it away! I\u2019ll look after it. Let the fighting\nUruk-hai do the work, as usual. If you\u2019re afraid of the Whiteskins,\nrun! Run! There\u2019s the forest,\u2019 he shouted, pointing ahead. \u2018Get to it!\nIt\u2019s your best hope. Off you go! And quick, before I knock a few\nmore heads off, to put some sense into the others.\u2019\nThere was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the North-\nerners broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running\nwildly along the river towards the mountains. The hobbits were left\nwith the Isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least of large,\nswart, slant-eyed Orcs with great bows and short broad-bladed\nswords. A few of the larger and bolder Northerners remained with\nthem.\n\u2018Now we\u2019ll deal with Grishna\u00b4kh,\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k; but some even of\nhis own followers were looking uneasily southwards.\n\u2018I know,\u2019 growled Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018The cursed horse-boys have got wind\nof us. But that\u2019s all your fault, Snaga. You and the other scouts ought\nto have your ears cut off. But we are the fighters. We\u2019ll feast on\nhorseflesh yet, or something better.\u2019\nAt that moment Pippin saw why some of the troop had been\npointing eastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries,\nand there was Grishna\u00b4kh again, and at his back a couple of score of\nothers like him: long-armed crook-legged Orcs. They had a red eye\npainted on their shields. Uglu\u00b4k stepped forward to meet them.\n\u2018So you\u2019ve come back?\u2019 he said. \u2018Thought better of it, eh?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve returned to see that Orders are carried out and the prisoners\nsafe,\u2019 answered Grishna\u00b4kh.\n\u2018Indeed!\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018Waste of effort. I\u2019ll see that orders are carried\nout in my command. And what else did you come back for? You\nwent in a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?\u2019\n\u2018I left a fool,\u2019 snarled Grishna\u00b4kh. \u2018But there were some stout fellows\nwith him that are too good to lose. I knew you\u2019d lead them into a\nmess. I\u2019ve come to help them.\u2019\n\u2018Splendid!\u2019 laughed Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018But unless you\u2019ve got some guts for\nfighting, you\u2019ve taken the wrong way. Lugbu\u00b4rz was your road. The\nWhiteskins are coming. What\u2019s happened to your precious Nazgu\u02c6l?\nHas he had another mount shot under him? Now, if you\u2019d brought"}
{"476": "\u2018Nazgu\u02c6l, Nazgu\u02c6l,\u2019 said Grishna\u00b4kh, shivering and licking his lips, as\nif the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. \u2018You speak\nof what is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Uglu\u00b4k,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Nazgu\u02c6l! Ah! All that they make out! One day you\u2019ll wish\nthat you had not said that. Ape!\u2019 he snarled fiercely. \u2018You ought\nto know that they\u2019re the apple of the Great Eye. But the winged\nNazgu\u02c6l: not yet, not yet. He won\u2019t let them show themselves across\nthe Great River yet, not too soon. They\u2019re for the War \u2013 and other\npurposes.\u2019\n\u2018You seem to know a lot,\u2019 said Uglu\u00b4k. \u2018More than is good for you,\nI guess. Perhaps those in Lugbu\u00b4rz might wonder how, and why. But\nin the meantime the Uruk-hai of Isengard can do the dirty work, as\nusual. Don\u2019t stand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The\nother swine are legging it to the forest. You\u2019d better follow. You\nwouldn\u2019t get back to the Great River alive. Right off the mark! Now!\nI\u2019ll be on your heels.\u2019\nThe Isengarders seized Merry and Pippin again and slung them\non their backs. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran,\npausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers.\nEither because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some\nplan of Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s, the Isengarders gradually passed through the\nOrcs of Mordor, and Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s folk closed in behind. Soon they\nwere gaining also on the Northerners ahead. The forest began to\ndraw nearer.\nPippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the\nfilthy jowl and hairy ear of the Orc that held him. Immediately in\nfront were bowed backs, and tough thick legs going up and down,\nup and down, unresting, as if they were made of wire and horn,\nbeating out the nightmare seconds of an endless time.\nIn the afternoon Uglu\u00b4k\u2019s troop overtook the Northerners. They\nwere flagging in the rays of the bright sun, winter sun shining in a\npale cool sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues\nlolling out.\n\u2018Maggots!\u2019 jeered the Isengarders. \u2018You\u2019re cooked. The Whiteskins\nwill catch you and eat you. They\u2019re coming!\u2019\nA cry from Grishna\u00b4kh showed that this was not mere jest. Horse-\nmen, riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind but\ngaining on the Orcs, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk\nstraying in a quicksand.\nThe Isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that aston-\nished Pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then"}
{"477": "heads and also began to put on speed. The forest was dark and close.\nAlready they had passed a few outlying trees. The land was beginning\nto slope upwards, ever more steeply; but the Orcs did not halt. Both\nUglu\u00b4k and Grishna\u00b4kh shouted, spurring them on to a last effort.\n\u2018They will make it yet. They will escape,\u2019 thought Pippin. And\nthen he managed to twist his neck, so as to glance back with one eye\nover his shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already\nlevel with the Orcs, galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their\nspears and helmets, and glinted in their pale flowing hair. They were\nhemming the Orcs in, preventing them from scattering, and driving\nthem along the line of the river.\nHe wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished\nnow that he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps\nand things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be\nin more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut\noff from Gandalf, or from Strider, and even from Frodo. All that he\ncould remember about Rohan was that Gandalf \u2019s horse, Shadowfax,\nhad come from that land. That sounded hopeful, as far as it went.\n\u2018But how will they know that we are not Orcs?\u2019 he thought. \u2018I\ndon\u2019t suppose they\u2019ve ever heard of hobbits down here. I suppose I\nought to be glad that the beastly Orcs look like being destroyed, but\nI would rather be saved myself.\u2019 The chances were that he and Merry\nwould be killed together with their captors, before ever the Men of\nRohan were aware of them.\nA few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting\nfrom a running horse. Riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at\nthe Orcs that straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the\nriders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their\nenemies, who shot wildly, not daring to halt. This happened many\ntimes, and on one occasion arrows fell among the Isengarders. One\nof them, just in front of Pippin, stumbled and did not get up again.\nNight came down without the Riders closing in for battle. Many\nOrcs had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness\nthe Orcs came to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, prob-\nably no more than three furlongs away, but they could go no further.\nThe horsemen had encircled them. A small band disobeyed Uglu\u00b4k\u2019s\ncommand, and ran on towards the forest: only three returned.\n\u2018Well, here we are,\u2019 sneered Grishna\u00b4kh. \u2018Fine leadership! I hope\nthe great Uglu\u00b4k will lead us out again.\u2019\n\u2018Put those Halflings down!\u2019 ordered Uglu\u00b4k, taking no notice of"}

Bind their legs!\u2019\nThe last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pippin\nfound that for the first time he was close to Merry. The Orcs were\nmaking a great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons,\nand the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think much of this,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I feel nearly done in.\nDon\u2019t think I could crawl away far, even if I was free.\u2019\n\u2018Lembas!\u2019 whispered Pippin. \u2018Lembas: I\u2019ve got some. Have you? I\ndon\u2019t think they\u2019ve taken anything but our swords.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I had a packet in my pocket,\u2019 answered Merry, \u2018but it must\nbe battered to crumbs. Anyway I can\u2019t put my mouth in my pocket!\u2019\n\u2018You won\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve\u2014\u2014\u2019; but just then a savage kick warned\nPippin that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful.\nThe night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the\nOrcs were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the\ndarkness, a complete ring of them. They were within a long bowshot,\nbut the riders did not show themselves against the light, and the Orcs\nwasted many arrows shooting at the fires, until Uglu\u00b4k stopped them.\nThe riders made no sound. Later in the night when the moon came\nout of the mist, then occasionally they could be seen, shadowy shapes\nthat glinted now and again in the white light, as they moved in\nceaseless patrol.\n\u2018They\u2019ll wait for the Sun, curse them!\u2019 growled one of the guards.\n\u2018Why don\u2019t we get together and charge through? What\u2019s old Uglu\u00b4k\nthink he\u2019s doing, I should like to know?\u2019\n\u2018I daresay you would,\u2019 snarled Uglu\u00b4k stepping up from behind.\n\u2018Meaning I don\u2019t think at all, eh? Curse you! You\u2019re as bad as the\nother rabble: the maggots and the apes of Lugbu\u00b4rz. No good trying\nto charge with them. They\u2019d just squeal and bolt, and there are more\nthan enough of these filthy horse-boys to mop up our lot on the\nflat.\n\u2018There\u2019s only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like\ngimlets in the dark. But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than\nmost Men, from all I\u2019ve heard; and don\u2019t forget their horses! They\ncan see the night-breeze, or so it\u2019s said. Still there\u2019s one thing the\nfine fellows don\u2019t know: Mauhu\u00b4r and his lads are in the forest, and\nthey should turn up any time now.\u2019\nUglu\u00b4 k\u2019s words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the Isengarders;\nbut the other Orcs were both dispirited and rebellious. They posted\na few watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the"}
{"479": "anything a few feet away. The fires brought no light to the hillock.\nThe riders were not, however, content merely to wait for the dawn\nand let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on the east side of the\nknoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that some of the\nMen had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge\nof the camp and killed several Orcs, and then had faded away again.\nUglu\u00b4k dashed off to stop a stampede.\nPippin and Merry sat up. Their guards, Isengarders, had gone\nwith Uglu\u00b4 k. But if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon\ndashed. A long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew\nthem close together. Dimly they were aware of Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s great\nhead and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their\ncheeks. He began to paw them and feel them. Pippin shuddered as\nhard cold fingers groped down his back.\n\u2018Well, my little ones!\u2019 said Grishna\u00b4kh in a soft whisper. \u2018Enjoying\nyour nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed perhaps: swords\nand whips on one side, and nasty spears on the other! Little people\nshould not meddle in affairs that are too big for them.\u2019 His fingers\ncontinued to grope. There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind\nhis eyes.\nThe thought came suddenly into Pippin\u2019s mind, as if caught direct\nfrom the urgent thought of his enemy: \u2018Grishna\u00b4kh knows about the\nRing! He\u2019s looking for it, while Uglu\u00b4k is busy: he probably wants it\nfor himself.\u2019 Cold fear was in Pippin\u2019s heart, yet at the same time he\nwas wondering what use he could make of Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s desire.\n\u2018I don\u2019t think you will find it that way,\u2019 he whispered. \u2018It isn\u2019t easy\nto find.\u2019\n\u2018Find it?\u2019 said Grishna\u00b4kh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped\nPippin\u2019s shoulder. \u2018Find what? What are you talking about, little\none?\u2019\nFor a moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness\nhe made a noise in his throat: gollum, gollum. \u2018Nothing, my precious,\u2019\nhe added.\nThe hobbits felt Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s fingers twitch. \u2018O ho!\u2019 hissed the\ngoblin softly. \u2018That\u2019s what he means, is it? O ho! Very ve-ry danger-\nous, my little ones.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin\u2019s guess.\n\u2018Perhaps; and not only for us. Still you know your own business best.\nDo you want it, or not? And what would you give for it?\u2019\n\u2018Do I want it? Do I want it?\u2019 said Grishna\u00b4kh, as if puzzled; but\nhis arms were trembling. \u2018What would I give for it? What do you\nmean?\u2019"}
{"480": "you must untie our legs first, or we\u2019ll do nothing, and say nothing.\u2019\n\u2018My dear tender little fools,\u2019 hissed Grishna\u00b4kh, \u2018everything you\nhave, and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time:\neverything! You\u2019ll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy\nthe Questioner, indeed you will: quite soon. We shan\u2019t hurry the\nenquiry. Oh dear no! What do you think you\u2019ve been kept alive for?\nMy dear little fellows, please believe me when I say that it was not\nout of kindness: that\u2019s not even one of Uglu\u00b4 k\u2019s faults.\u2019\n\u2018I find it quite easy to believe,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But you haven\u2019t got\nyour prey home yet. And it doesn\u2019t seem to be going your way,\nwhatever happens. If we come to Isengard, it won\u2019t be the great\nGrishna\u00b4kh that benefits: Saruman will take all that he can find. If\nyou want anything for yourself, now\u2019s the time to do a deal.\u2019\nGrishna\u00b4kh began to lose his temper. The name of Saruman seemed\nspecially to enrage him. Time was passing and the disturbance was\ndying down. Uglu\u00b4k or the Isengarders might return at any minute.\n\u2018Have you got it \u2013 either of you?\u2019 he snarled.\n\u2018Gollum, gollum!\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Untie our legs!\u2019 said Merry.\nThey felt the Orc\u2019s arms trembling violently. \u2018Curse you, you filthy\nlittle vermin!\u2019 he hissed. \u2018Untie your legs? I\u2019ll untie every string in\nyour bodies. Do you think I can\u2019t search you to the bones? Search\nyou! I\u2019ll cut you both to quivering shreds. I don\u2019t need the help of\nyour legs to get you away \u2013 and have you all to myself !\u2019\nSuddenly he seized them. The strength in his long arms and shoul-\nders was terrifying. He tucked them one under each armpit, and\ncrushed them fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped\nover each of their mouths. Then he sprang forward, stooping low.\nQuickly and silently he went, until he came to the edge of the knoll.\nThere, choosing a gap between the watchers, he passed like an evil\nshadow out into the night, down the slope and away westward\ntowards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that direction there\nwas a wide open space with only one fire.\nAfter going a dozen yards he halted, peering and listening. Nothing\ncould be seen or heard. He crept slowly on, bent almost double.\nThen he squatted and listened again. Then he stood up, as if to risk\na sudden dash. At that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed\nup right in front of him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called\nout.\nGrishna\u00b4kh flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits\nunder him; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his\ncaptives, rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it"}
{"481": "gloom: it was aimed with skill, or guided by fate, and it pierced his\nright hand. He dropped the sword and shrieked. There was a quick\nbeat of hoofs, and even as Grishna\u00b4kh leaped up and ran, he was\nridden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a hideous\nshivering cry and lay still.\nThe hobbits remained flat on the ground, as Grishna\u00b4kh had left\nthem. Another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade\u2019s aid.\nWhether because of some special keenness of sight, or because of\nsome other sense, the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them; but\nits rider did not see them, lying covered in their elven-cloaks, too\ncrushed for the moment, and too afraid to move.\nAt last Merry stirred and whispered softly: \u2018So far so good; but\nhow are we to avoid being spitted?\u2019\nThe answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishna\u00b4kh had\nroused the Orcs. From the yells and screeches that came from the\nknoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been dis-\ncovered: Uglu\u00b4k was probably knocking off a few more heads. Then\nsuddenly the answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, out-\nside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the\nmountains. Mauhu\u00b4r had apparently arrived and was attacking the\nbesiegers. There was the sound of galloping horses. The Riders were\ndrawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the orc-arrows,\nso as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal with\nthe newcomers. Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized that without\nmoving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between\nthem and escape.\n\u2018Now,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018if only we had our legs and hands free, we\nmight get away. But I can\u2019t touch the knots, and I can\u2019t bite them.\u2019\n\u2018No need to try,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I was going to tell you: I\u2019ve managed\nto free my hands. These loops are only left for show. You\u2019d better\nhave a bit of lembas first.\u2019\nHe slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The\ncakes were broken, but good, still in their leaf-wrappings. The hobbits\neach ate two or three pieces. The taste brought back to them the\nmemory of fair faces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet\ndays now far away. For a while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the\ndark, heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby. Pippin was\nthe first to come back to the present.\n\u2018We must be off,\u2019 he said. \u2018Half a moment!\u2019 Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s sword\nwas lying close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to\nuse; so he crawled forward, and finding the body of the goblin he"}
{"482": "\u2018Now for it!\u2019 he said. \u2018When we\u2019ve warmed up a bit, perhaps we\nshall be able to stand again, and walk. But in any case we had better\nstart by crawling.\u2019\nThey crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped\nthem; but it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire\na wide berth, and wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they\ncame to the edge of the river, gurgling away in the black shadows\nunder its deep banks. Then they looked back.\nThe sounds had died away. Evidently Mauhu\u00b4r and his \u2018lads\u2019 had\nbeen killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent\nominous vigil. It would not last very much longer. Already the night\nwas old. In the East, which had remained unclouded, the sky was\nbeginning to grow pale.\n\u2018We must get under cover,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018or we shall be seen. It\nwill not be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not\nOrcs after we are dead.\u2019 He got up and stamped his feet. \u2018Those\ncords have cut me like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I\ncould stagger on now. What about you, Merry?\u2019\nMerry got up. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I can manage it. Lembas does put\nheart into you! A more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat\nof that orc-draught. I wonder what it was made of. Better not to\nknow, I expect. Let\u2019s get a drink of water to wash away the thought\nof it!\u2019\n\u2018Not here, the banks are too steep,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Forward now!\u2019\nThey turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the\nriver. Behind them the light grew in the East. As they walked they\ncompared notes, talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that\nhad happened since their capture. No listener would have guessed\nfrom their words that they had suffered cruelly, and been in dire\nperil, going without hope towards torment and death; or that even\nnow, as they knew well, they had little chance of ever finding friend\nor safety again.\n\u2018You seem to have been doing well, Master Took,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018You will get almost a chapter in old Bilbo\u2019s book, if ever I get a\nchance to report to him. Good work: especially guessing that hairy\nvillain\u2019s little game, and playing up to him. But I wonder if anyone\nwill ever pick up your trail and find that brooch. I should hate to\nlose mine, but I am afraid yours is gone for good.\n\u2018I shall have to brush up my toes, if I am to get level with you.\nIndeed Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now. This is where he\ncomes in. I don\u2019t suppose you have much notion where we are; but\nIspentmytimeatRivendellratherbetter.Wearewalkingwestalong"}
{"483": "Even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight\nbefore them. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees,\ncreeping away from the coming Dawn.\n\u2018Lead on, Master Brandybuck!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Or lead back! We\nhave been warned against Fangorn. But one so knowing will not have\nforgotten that.\u2019\n\u2018I have not,\u2019 answered Merry; \u2018but the forest seems better to me,\nall the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.\u2019\nHe led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. Old\nbeyond guessing, they seemed. Great trailing beards of lichen hung\nfrom them, blowing and swaying in the breeze. Out of the shadows\nthe hobbits peeped, gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures\nthat in the dim light looked like elf-children in the deeps of time\npeering out of the Wild Wood in wonder at their first Dawn.\nFar over the Great River, and the Brown Lands, leagues upon\ngrey leagues away, the Dawn came, red as flame. Loud rang the\nhunting-horns to greet it. The Riders of Rohan sprang suddenly to\nlife. Horn answered horn again.\nMerry and Pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of\nwar-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. The Sun\u2019s limb\nwas lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. Then with\na great cry the Riders charged from the East; the red light gleamed\non mail and spear. The Orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that\nremained to them. The hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their\nline held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged\nagain. Most of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled,\nthis way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But one band,\nholding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the\ndirection of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards\nthe watchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain\nthat they would escape: they had already hewn down three Riders\nthat barred their way.\n\u2018We have watched too long,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018There\u2019s Uglu\u00b4k! I don\u2019t\nwant to meet him again.\u2019 The hobbits turned and fled deep into the\nshadows of the wood.\nSo it was that they did not see the last stand, when Uglu\u00b4 k was\novertaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he\nwas slain at last by E\u00b4omer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, who\ndismounted and fought him sword to sword. And over the wide fields\nthe keen-eyed Riders hunted down the few Orcs that had escaped\nand still had strength to fly."}
{"484": "ashes of their enemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came\never back either to Mordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of the\nburning rose high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes."}
{"485": "Chapter 4\nTREEBEARD\nMeanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and\ntangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, west-\nward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper\ninto Fangorn. Slowly their fear of the Orcs died away, and their pace\nslackened. A queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were\ntoo thin or too scanty for breathing.\nAt last Merry halted. \u2018We can\u2019t go on like this,\u2019 he panted. \u2018I want\nsome air.\u2019\n\u2018Let\u2019s have a drink at any rate,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I\u2019m parched.\u2019 He\nclambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream,\nand stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear\nand cold, and he took many draughts. Merry followed him. The\nwater refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while\nthey sat together on the brink of the stream, dabbling their sore feet\nand legs, and peering round at the trees that stood silently about\nthem, rank upon rank, until they faded away into grey twilight in\nevery direction.\n\u2018I suppose you haven\u2019t lost us already?\u2019 said Pippin, leaning back\nagainst a great tree-trunk. \u2018We can at least follow the course of this\nstream, the Entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the\nway we came.\u2019\n\u2018We could, if our legs would do it,\u2019 said Merry; \u2018and if we could\nbreathe properly.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018It reminds\nme, somehow, of the old room in the Great Place of the Tooks away\nback in the Smials at Tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture\nhas never been moved or changed for generations. They say the Old\nTook lived in it year after year, while he and the room got older and\nshabbier together \u2013 and it has never been changed since he died, a\ncentury ago. And Old Gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that\nputs it back a bit. But that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood.\nLook at all those weeping, trailing, beards and whiskers of lichen!\nAnd most of the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leaves\nthat have never fallen. Untidy. I can\u2019t imagine what spring would\nlook like here, if it ever comes; still less a spring-cleaning.\u2019\n\u2018But the Sun at any rate must peep in sometimes,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018It"}
{"486": "just dim, and frightfully tree-ish. You can\u2019t imagine animals living\nhere at all, or staying for long.\u2019\n\u2018No, nor hobbits,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018And I don\u2019t like the thought of\ntrying to get through it either. Nothing to eat for a hundred miles, I\nshould guess. How are our supplies?\u2019\n\u2018Low,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We ran off with nothing but a couple of spare\npackets of lembas, and left everything else behind.\u2019 They looked at\nwhat remained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five\nmeagre days, that was all. \u2018And not a wrap or a blanket,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018We shall be cold tonight, whichever way we go.\u2019\n\u2018Well, we\u2019d better decide on the way now,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018The\nmorning must be getting on.\u2019\nJust then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared,\nsome way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed sud-\ndenly to have pierced the forest-roof.\n\u2018Hullo!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018The Sun must have run into a cloud while\nwe\u2019ve been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else\nshe has climbed high enough to look down through some opening.\nIt isn\u2019t far \u2013 let\u2019s go and investigate!\u2019\nThey found it was further than they thought. The ground was\nrising steeply still, and it was becoming increasingly stony. The light\ngrew broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock-\nwall before them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of some long root\nthrust out by the distant mountains. No trees grew on it, and the sun\nwas falling full on its stony face. The twigs of the trees at its foot were\nstretched out stiff and still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where\nall had looked so shabby and grey before, the wood now gleamed\nwith rich browns, and with the smooth black-greys of bark like\npolished leather. The boles of the trees glowed with a soft green like\nyoung grass: early spring or a fleeting vision of it was about them.\nIn the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair:\nnatural perhaps, and made by the weathering and splitting of the\nrock, for it was rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the\ntops of forest-trees, there was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew\nthere but a few grasses and weeds at its edge, and one old stump of\na tree with only two bent branches left: it looked almost like the\nfigure of some gnarled old man, standing there, blinking in the\nmorning-light.\n\u2018Up we go!\u2019 said Merry joyfully. \u2018Now for a breath of air, and a\nsight of the land!\u2019\nThey climbed and scrambled up the rock. If the stair had been"}
{"487": "and sores of their captivity had healed and their vigour had returned.\nThey came at length to the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the\nold stump; then they sprang up and turned round with their backs\nto the hill, breathing deep, and looking out eastward. They saw that\nthey had only come some three or four miles into the forest: the\nheads of the trees marched down the slopes towards the plain. There,\nnear the fringe of the forest, tall spires of curling black smoke went\nup, wavering and floating towards them.\n\u2018The wind\u2019s changing,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018It\u2019s turned east again. It feels\ncool up here.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Pippin; \u2018I\u2019m afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it\nwill all go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so\ndifferent in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.\u2019\n\u2018Almost felt you liked the Forest! That\u2019s good! That\u2019s uncommonly\nkind of you,\u2019 said a strange voice. \u2018Turn round and let me have a\nlook at your faces. I almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not\nlet us be hasty. Turn around!\u2019 A large knob-knuckled hand was laid\non each of their shoulders, and they were twisted round, gently but\nirresistibly; then two great arms lifted them up.\nThey found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face.\nIt belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least\nfourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck.\nWhether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that\nwas its hide, was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short\ndistance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown\nsmooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each. The lower part of\nthe long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost\ntwiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment\nthe hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now\nsurveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. They were\nbrown, shot with a green light. Often afterwards Pippin tried to\ndescribe his first impression of them.\n\u2018One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up\nwith ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface\nwas sparkling with the present; like sun shimmering on the outer\nleaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don\u2019t\nknow, but it felt as if something that grew in the ground \u2013 asleep,\nyou might say, or just feeling itself as something between root-tip\nand leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up,\nand was considering you with the same slow care that it had given\nto its own inside affairs for endless years.\u2019"}

Very odd you are, indeed. Root and twig, very odd!\u2019\nPippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those\neyes he felt a curious suspense, but not fear. \u2018Please,\u2019 he said, \u2018who\nare you? And what are you?\u2019\nA queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep\nwells were covered over. \u2018Hrum, now,\u2019 answered the voice; \u2018well, I\nam an Ent, or that\u2019s what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. The\nEnt, I am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. Fangorn is my\nname according to some, Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.\u2019\n\u2018An Ent?\u2019 said Merry. \u2018What\u2019s that? But what do you call yourself ?\nWhat\u2019s your real name?\u2019\n\u2018Hoo now!\u2019 replied Treebeard. \u2018Hoo! Now that would be telling!\nNot so hasty. And I am doing the asking. You are in my country.\nWhat are you, I wonder? I cannot place you. You do not seem to\ncome in the old lists that I learned when I was young.

{"489": "\u2018We always seem to have got left out of the old lists, and the old\nstories,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Yet we\u2019ve been about for quite a long time.\nWe\u2019re hobbits.\u2019\n\u2018Why not make a new line?\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers.\nPut us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you\u2019ve\ngot it.\u2019\n\u2018Hm! Not bad, not bad,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018That would do. So you\nlive in holes, eh? It sounds very right and proper. Who calls you\nhobbits, though? That does not sound Elvish to me. Elves made all\nthe old words: they began it.\u2019\n\u2018Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Hoom, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call yourselves\nhobbits? But you should not go telling just anybody. You\u2019ll be letting\nout your own right names if you\u2019re not careful.\u2019\n\u2018We aren\u2019t careful about that,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018As a matter of fact\nI\u2019m a Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call\nme just Merry.\u2019\n\u2018And I\u2019m a Took, Peregrin Took, but I\u2019m generally called Pippin,\nor even Pip.\u2019\n\u2018Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018I am honoured\nby your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There\nare Ents and Ents, you know; or there are Ents and things that look\nlike Ents but ain\u2019t, as you might say. I\u2019ll call you Merry and Pippin,\nif you please \u2013 nice names. For I am not going to tell you my name,\nnot yet at any rate.\u2019 A queer half-knowing, half-humorous look came\nwith a green flicker into his eyes. \u2018For one thing it would take a\nlong while: my name is growing all the time, and I\u2019ve lived a very\nlong, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the\nstory of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish\nas you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time\nto say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it\nis worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.\n\u2018But now,\u2019 and the eyes became very bright and \u2018present\u2019, seeming\nto grow smaller and almost sharp, \u2018what is going on?

You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that\nmatter?\u2019\n\u2018Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We\nhave only a little food.\u2019"}
{"491": "long while. And if we decide to part company, I can set you down\noutside my country at any point you choose. Let us go!\u2019\nHolding the hobbits gently but firmly, one in the crook of each\narm, Treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other, and\nmoved them to the edge of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the\nrocks. Then carefully and solemnly, he stalked down from step to\nstep, and reached the floor of the Forest.\nAt once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees,\ndeeper and deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing\nsteadily up towards the slopes of the mountains. Many of the trees\nseemed asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that\nmerely passed by; but some quivered, and some raised up their\nbranches above his head as he approached. All the while, as he\nwalked, he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical\nsounds.\nThe hobbits were silent for some time. They felt, oddly enough,\nsafe and comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder\nabout. At last Pippin ventured to speak again.\n\u2018Please, Treebeard,\u2019 he said, \u2018could I ask you something? Why did\nCeleborn warn us against your forest? He told us not to risk getting\nentangled in it.\u2019\n\u2018Hmm, did he now?\u2019 rumbled Treebeard. \u2018And I might have said\nmuch the same, if you had been going the other way. Do not risk\ngetting entangled in the woods of Laurelindo\u00b4renan! That is what the\nElves used to call it, but now they make the name shorter: Lothlo\u00b4rien\nthey call it. Perhaps they are right: maybe it is fading, not growing.\nLand of the Valley of Singing Gold, that was it, once upon a time.\nNow it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is a queer place, and not\nfor just anyone to venture in. I am surprised that you ever got out,\nbut much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not happened\nto strangers for many a year. It is a queer land.\n\u2018And so is this. Folk have come to grief here. Aye, they have, to\ngrief.

Still:\nTaurelilo\u00b4me\u00a8a-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaure\u00a8a Lo\u00b4me\u00a8anor*\nthat is what they used to say. Things have changed, but it is still true\nin places.\u2019"}
{"492": "\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018What is true?\u2019\n\u2018The trees and the Ents,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018I do not understand all\nthat goes on myself, so I cannot explain it to you. Some of us are\nstill true Ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing\nsleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just\ntrees, of course; but many are half awake. Some are quite wide awake,\nand a few are, well, ah, well getting Entish. That is going on all the\ntime.\n\u2018When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts.\nNothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew\nsome good old willows down the Entwash, gone long ago, alas! They\nwere quite hollow, indeed they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet\nand sweet-spoken as a young leaf. And then there are some trees in\nthe valleys under the mountains, sound as a bell, and bad right\nthrough. That sort of thing seems to spread. There used to be some\nvery dangerous parts in this country. There are still some very black\npatches.\u2019\n\u2018Like the Old Forest away to the north, do you mean?\u2019 asked\nMerry.\n\u2018Aye, aye, something like, but much worse. I do not doubt there\nis some shadow of the Great Darkness lying there still away north;\nand bad memories are handed down. But there are hollow dales in\nthis land where the Darkness has never been lifted, and the trees are\nolder than I am. Still, we do what we can. We keep off strangers and\nthe foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.\n\u2018We are tree-herds, we old Ents. Few enough of us are left now.\nSheep get like shepherd, and shepherds like sheep, it is said; but\nslowly, and neither have long in the world. It is quicker and closer\nwith trees and Ents, and they walk down the ages together. For Ents\nare more like Elves: less interested in themselves than Men are, and\nbetter at getting inside other things. And yet again Ents are more\nlike Men, more changeable than Elves are, and quicker at taking the\ncolour of the outside, you might say. Or better than both: for they\nare steadier and keep their minds on things longer.\n\u2018Some of my kin look just like trees now, and need something\ngreat to rouse them; and they speak only in whispers. But some of\nmy trees are limb-lithe, and many can talk to me. Elves began it, of\ncourse, waking trees up and teaching them to speak and learning\ntheir tree-talk. They always wished to talk to everything, the old Elves\ndid. But then the Great Darkness came, and they passed away over\nthe Sea, or fled into far valleys, and hid themselves, and made songs\naboutdaysthatwouldnevercomeagain.Neveragain.Aye,aye,there"}
{"493": "\u2018Those were the broad days! Time was when I could walk and\nsing all day and hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the\nhollow hills.

I used to spend\na week just breathing.\u2019\nTreebeard fell silent, striding along, and yet making hardly a sound\nwith his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a\nmurmuring chant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was\nchanting to them:\nIn the willow-meads of Tasarinan I walked in the Spring.\nAh! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion!\nAnd I said that was good.\nI wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand.\nAh! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of\nOssir!\nAnd I thought that was best.\nTo the beeches of Neldoreth I came in the Autumn.\nAh! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn\nin Taur-na-neldor!\nIt was more than my desire.\nTo the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the\nWinter.\nAh! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter\nupon Orod-na-Tho\u02c6n!\nMy voice went up and sang in the sky.\nAnd now all those lands lie under the wave,\nAnd I walk in Ambaro\u00b4na, in Tauremorna, in Aldalo\u00b4me\u00a8,\nIn my own land, in the country of Fangorn,\nWhere the roots are long,\nAnd the years lie thicker than the leaves\nIn Tauremornalo\u00b4me\u00a8.\nHe ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear\ncould reach, there was not a sound.\nThe day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees.\nAt last the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land:\nthey had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots\nof tall Methedras. Down the hillside the young Entwash, leaping\nfrom its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet\nthem. On the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with"}
{"494": "Treebeard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Sud-\ndenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees\nstood there, one on either side, like living gate-posts; but there was\nno gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs. As the old Ent\napproached, the trees lifted up their branches, and all their leaves\nquivered and rustled. For they were evergreen trees, and their leaves\nwere dark and polished, and gleamed in the twilight. Beyond them\nwas a wide level space, as though the floor of a great hall had been\ncut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped upwards,\nuntil they were fifty feet high or more, and along each wall stood an\naisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards.\nAt the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bottom it had\nbeen hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only\nroof of the hall, save the branches of the trees, which at the inner\nend overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad open path in\nthe middle. A little stream escaped from the springs above, and leav-\ning the main water, fell tinkling down the sheer face of the wall,\npouring in silver drops, like a fine curtain in front of the arched bay.\nThe water was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between\nthe trees, and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path,\nout to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through the forest.\n\u2018Hm! Here we are!\u2019 said Treebeard, breaking his long silence. \u2018I\nhave brought you about seventy thousand ent-strides, but what that\ncomes to in the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow\nwe are near the roots of the Last Mountain. Part of the name of this\nplace might be Wellinghall, if it were turned into your language. I\nlike it. We will stay here tonight.\u2019 He set them down on the grass\nbetween the aisles of the trees, and they followed him towards the\ngreat arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees\nhardly bent, but his legs opened in a great stride. He planted his big\ntoes (and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the ground first,\nbefore any other part of his feet.\nFor a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring,\nand took a deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great\nstone table stood there, but no chairs. At the back of the bay it was\nalready quite dark. Treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them\non the table. They seemed to be filled with water; but he held his\nhands over them, and immediately they began to glow, one with a\ngolden and the other with a rich green light; and the blending of the\ntwo lights lit the bay, as if the sun of summer was shining through a\nroof of young leaves. Looking back, the hobbits saw that the trees in"}
{"495": "some red as copper; while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded\nout of luminous stone.\n\u2018Well, well, now we can talk again,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018You are\nthirsty, I expect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!\u2019 He went to\nthe back of the bay, and then they saw that several tall stone jars\nstood there, with heavy lids. He removed one of the lids, and dipped\nin a great ladle, and with it filled three bowls, one very large bowl,\nand two smaller ones.\n\u2018This is an ent-house,\u2019 he said, \u2018and there are no seats, I fear. But\nyou may sit on the table.\u2019 Picking up the hobbits he set them on the\ngreat stone slab, six feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling\ntheir legs, and drinking in sips.\nThe drink was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts\nthey had drunk from the Entwash near the borders of the forest, and\nyet there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe:\nit was faint, but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood\nborne from afar by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the draught\nbegan at the toes, and rose steadily through every limb, bringing\nrefreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards, right to the tips of the\nhair. Indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads was actually\nstanding up, waving and curling and growing. As for Treebeard, he\nfirst laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch, and then he drained\nhis bowl at one draught, one long, slow draught. The hobbits thought\nhe would never stop.\nAt last he set the bowl down again. \u2018Ah \u2013 ah,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018Hm,\nhoom, now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will\nlie down; that will prevent this drink from rising to my head and\nsending me to sleep.\u2019\nOn the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs, not\nmore than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and\nbracken. Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the\nslightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length,\nwith his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling, upon which\nlights were flickering, like the play of leaves in the sunshine. Merry\nand Pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass.\n\u2018Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!\u2019 said Treebeard.\nThe hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever\nsince they left Hobbiton. They followed no very clear order, for they\ninterrupted one another continually, and Treebeard often stopped\nthe speaker, and went back to some earlier point, or jumped forward\naskingquestionsaboutlaterevents.Theysaidnothingwhateverabout"}
{"496": "He was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders,\nin Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in\nthe Mines of Moria, and in Lothlo\u00b4rien and Galadriel. He made them\ndescribe the Shire and its country over and over again. He said an\nodd thing at this point. \u2018You never see any, hm, any Ents round\nthere, do you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Well, not Ents, Entwives I should really\nsay.\u2019\n\u2018Entwives?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Are they like you at all?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, hm, well no: I do not really know now,\u2019 said Treebeard\nthoughtfully. \u2018But they would like your country, so I just wondered.\u2019\nTreebeard was however especially interested in everything that\nconcerned Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman\u2019s doings.\nThe hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them:\nonly a rather vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told the\nCouncil. But they were clear at any rate that Uglu\u00b4k and his troop\ncame from Isengard, and spoke of Saruman as their master.\n\u2018Hm, hoom!\u2019 said Treebeard, when at last their story had wound\nand wandered down to the battle of the Orcs and the Riders of\nRohan. \u2018Well, well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You\nhave not told me all, no indeed, not by a long way. But I do not\ndoubt that you are doing as Gandalf would wish. There is something\nvery big going on, that I can see, and what it is maybe I shall learn\nin good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, but it is a strange\nbusiness: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold!\nthe Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes\nthem on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras\nGaladhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the leagues of Wilderland:\nindeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they\nweather it!\u2019\n\u2018And what about yourself ?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,\u2019 said\nTreebeard; \u2018they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business\nof Wizards: Wizards are always troubled about the future. I do not\nlike worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody\u2019s side,\nbecause nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me:\nnobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves now-\nadays. Still, I take more kindly to Elves than to others: it was the\nElves that cured us of dumbness long ago, and that was a great gift\nthat cannot be forgotten, though our ways have parted since. And\nthere are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether not on;\nI am against them altogether: these \u2013 bura\u00b4rum\u2019 (he again made a deep\nrumble of disgust) \u2018\u2014\u2014these Orcs, and their masters."}

There is naught that\nan old Ent can do to hold back that storm: he must weather it or\ncrack.\n\u2018But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook\nhim. I must do something, I suppose. I have often wondered lately\nwhat I should do about Saruman.\u2019\n\u2018Who is Saruman?\u2019 asked Pippin. \u2018Do you know anything about\nhis history?\u2019\n\u2018Saruman is a Wizard,\u2019 answered Treebeard. \u2018More than that I\ncannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They appeared\nfirst after the Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with\nthe Ships I never can tell. Saruman was reckoned great among them,\nI believe. He gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of\nMen and Elves, some time ago \u2013 you would call it a very long time\nago; and he settled down at Angrenost, or Isengard as the Men of\nRohan call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but his fame began\nto grow. He was chosen to be the head of the White Council, they\nsay; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now if even then\nSaruman was not turning to evil ways. But at any rate he used to\ngive no trouble to his neighbours. I used to talk to him. There was\na time when he was always walking about my woods. He was polite\nin those days, always asking my leave (at least when he met me); and\nalways eager to listen. I told him many things that he would never\nhave found out by himself; but he never repaid me in like kind. I\ncannot remember that he ever told me anything. And he got more\nand more like that; his face, as I remember it \u2013 I have not seen it for\nmany a day \u2013 became like windows in a stone wall: windows with\nshutters inside.\n\u2018I think that I now understand what he is up to. He is plotting to\nbecome a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does\nnot care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the\nmoment. And now it is clear that he is a black traitor. He has taken\nup with foul folk, with the Orcs. Brm, hoom! Worse than that: he\nhas been doing something to them; something dangerous. For these\nIsengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a mark of evil things that\ncame in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the Sun; but\nSaruman\u2019s Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder what\nhe has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the\nraces of Orcs and Men?

You\nmay be able to help me. You will be helping your own friends that\nway, too; for if Saruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have\nan enemy behind as well as in front.

I must cool myself and think; for\nit is easier to shout stop! than to do it.\u2019\nHe strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling\nrain of the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever\nthe drops of water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted\nlike red and green sparks.

He\nseemed to be counting on his fingers. \u2018Fangorn, Finglas, Fladrif, aye,\naye,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018The trouble is that there are so few of us left,\u2019 he\nsaid turning towards the hobbits. \u2018Only three remain of the first Ents\nthat walked in the woods before the Darkness: only myself, Fangorn,\nand Finglas and Fladrif \u2013 to give them their Elvish names; you may\ncall them Leaflock and Skinbark if you like that better.

{"499": "hair he is. He used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been too\ndrowsy to walk far even then. Skinbark lived on the mountain-slopes\nwest of Isengard.

He has gone up into the high places,\namong the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down.\nStill, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our younger\nfolks \u2013 if I could make them understand the need; if I could rouse\nthem: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity there are so few of us!\u2019\n\u2018Why are there so few, when you have lived in this country so\nlong?\u2019 asked Pippin. \u2018Have a great many died?\u2019\n\u2018Oh, no!\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018None have died from inside, as you\nmight say. Some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of\ncourse; and more have grown tree-ish. But there were never many\nof us and we have not increased. There have been no Entings \u2013 no\nchildren, you would say, not for a terrible long count of years. You\nsee, we lost the Entwives.\u2019\n\u2018How very sad!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018How was it that they all died?\u2019\n\u2018They did not die!\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018I never said died. We lost\nthem, I said. We lost them and we cannot find them.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018I\nthought most folk knew that. There were songs about the hunt of\nthe Ents for the Entwives sung among Elves and Men from Mirkwood\nto Gondor. They cannot be quite forgotten.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I am afraid the songs have not come west over the Moun-\ntains to the Shire,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Won\u2019t you tell us some more, or sing\nus one of the songs?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I will indeed,\u2019 said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the\nrequest. \u2018But I cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we\nmust end our talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to\ndo, and maybe a journey to begin.\u2019\n\u2018It is rather a strange and sad story,\u2019 he went on after a pause.\n\u2018When the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the\nEnts and the Entwives \u2013 and there were Entmaidens then: ah! the\nloveliness of Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of\nour youth! \u2013 they walked together and they housed together. But our\nhearts did not go on growing in the same way: the Ents gave their\nlove to things that they met in the world, and the Entwives gave their\nthought to other things, for the Ents loved the great trees, and the\nwild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; and they drank of the\nmountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their\npath; and they learned of the Elves and spoke with the Trees.

They did not desire to speak with these\nthings; but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them.\nThe Entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes, and\nbear leaf and fruit to their liking; for the Entwives desired order, and\nplenty, and peace (by which they meant that things should remain\nwhere they had set them). So the Entwives made gardens to live in.\nBut we Ents went on wandering, and we only came to the gardens\nnow and again. Then when the Darkness came in the North, the\nEntwives crossed the Great River, and made new gardens, and tilled\nnew fields, and we saw them more seldom. After the Darkness was\noverthrown the land of the Entwives blossomed richly, and their fields\nwere full of corn. Many men learned the crafts of the Entwives and\nhonoured them greatly; but we were only a legend to them, a secret\nin the heart of the forest. Yet here we still are, while all the gardens\nof the Entwives are wasted: Men call them the Brown Lands now.\n\u2018I remember it was long ago \u2013 in the time of the war between\nSauron and the Men of the Sea \u2013 desire came over me to see Fimbre-\nthil again. Very fair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen\nher, though little like the Entmaiden of old. For the Entwives were\nbent and browned by their labour; their hair parched by the sun to\nthe hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their eyes\nwere still the eyes of our own people. We crossed over Anduin and\ncame to their land; but we found a desert: it was all burned and\nuprooted, for war had passed over it. But the Entwives were not\nthere. Long we called, and long we searched; and we asked all folk\nthat we met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had\nnever seen them; and some said that they had seen them walking\naway west, and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that\nwe went could we find them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the\nwild wood called, and we returned to it. For many years we used to\ngo out every now and again and look for the Entwives, walking far\nand wide and calling them by their beautiful names. But as time\npassed we went more seldom and wandered less far. And now the\nEntwives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and\ngrey. The Elves made many songs concerning the Search of the Ents,\nand some of the songs passed into the tongues of Men. But we made\nno songs about it, being content to chant their beautiful names when\nwe thought of the Entwives. We believe that we may meet again in\na time to come, and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where\nwe can live together and both be content. But it is foreboded that"}

Where\nwill you stand?\u2019\n\u2018We usually lie down to sleep,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We shall be all right\nwhere we are.\u2019\n\u2018Lie down to sleep!\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018Why of course you do!

Good\nnight!\u2019\nMerry and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft\ngrass and fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights\ndied down, and the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the\narch they could see old Treebeard standing, motionless, with his\narms raised above his head. The bright stars peered out of the sky,\nand lit the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers and head, and\ndripped, dripped, in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet. Listening\nto the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep.\nThey woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on\nto the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running\non a stiff easterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while\nMerry and Pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard\nhim humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees.\n\u2018Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!\u2019 he boomed, when\nhe saw them. \u2018You sleep long. I have been many a hundred strides\nalready today. Now we will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.\u2019\nHe poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a\ndifferent jar. The taste was not the same as it had been the night\nbefore: it was earthier and richer, more sustaining and food-like, so\nto speak. While the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed,\nand nibbling small pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that\neating was a necessary part of breakfast than because they felt\nhungry), Treebeard stood, humming in Entish or Elvish or some\nstrange tongue, and looking up at the sky.\n\u2018Where is Entmoot?\u2019 Pippin ventured to ask.\n\u2018Hoo, eh? Entmoot?\u2019 said Treebeard, turning round. \u2018It is not a\nplace, it is a gathering of Ents\u2013which does not often happen nowadays.\nBut I have managed to make a fair number promise to come. We shall\nmeetintheplacewherewehavealwaysmet:DerndingleMencallit."}
{"503": "as on the previous day. At the entrance to the court he turned to the\nright, stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along\nthe feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these\nthe hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark\nclimbing pinewoods. Soon Treebeard turned a little away from the\nhills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller,\nand thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. For a\nwhile they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed\nwhen they first ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. Treebeard\ndid not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully,\nbut Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like boom,\nboom, rumboom, boorar, boom boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom,\nand so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and\nagain they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound,\nthat seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their\nheads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not\nstop or turn his head to either side.\nThey had been going for a long while \u2013 Pippin had tried to keep\ncount of the \u2018ent-strides\u2019 but had failed, getting lost at about three\nthousand \u2013 when Treebeard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he\nstopped, put the hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his\nmouth so that they made a hollow tube; then he blew or called\nthrough them. A great hoom, hom rang out like a deep-throated horn\nin the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. Far off there came\nfrom several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that was not an\necho but an answer.\nTreebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and\nstrode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call,\nand each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they\ncame at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark ever-\ngreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before:\nthey branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark\nglossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright\nflower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.\nTurning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came\nin a few strides to a narrow entrance. Through it a worn path passed\nand dived suddenly down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that\nthey were descending into a great dingle, almost as round as a bowl,\nvery wide and deep, crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen\nhedge. It was smooth and grassclad inside, and there were no trees\nexcept three very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at the"}
{"504": "Several Ents had already arrived. More were coming in down the\nother paths, and some were now following Treebeard. As they drew\nnear the hobbits gazed at them. They had expected to see a number\nof creatures as much like Treebeard as one hobbit is like another (at\nany rate to a stranger\u2019s eye); and they were very much surprised to\nsee nothing of the kind. The Ents were as different from one another\nas trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of\nthe same name but quite different growth and history; and some as\ndifferent as one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech, oak\nfrom fir. There were a few older Ents, bearded and gnarled like hale\nbut ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as Treebeard); and\nthere were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like\nforest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, no saplings.\nAltogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy\nfloor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in.\nAt first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that\nthey saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth, and\nheight, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and\nfingers (anything from three to nine). A few seemed more or less\nrelated to Treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But\nthere were other kinds. Some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned\nEnts with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some\nrecalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered hands and\nlong legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, the\nrowan, and the linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Tree-\nbeard, bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical\nvoices, and looking long and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits\nsaw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same\neyes: not all so old or so deep as Treebeard\u2019s, but all with the same\nslow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.\nAs soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide\ncircle round Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation\nbegan. The Ents began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then\nanother, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and\nfalling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away\nthere and rising to a great boom on the other side. Though he could\nnot catch or understand any of the words \u2013 he supposed the language\nwas Entish \u2013 Pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at\nfirst; but gradually his attention wavered. After a long time (and the\nchant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering,\nsince Entish was such an \u2018unhasty\u2019 language, whether they had yet\ngot further than Good Morning; and if Treebeard was to call the roll,"}
{"505": "Treebeard was immediately aware of him. \u2018Hm, ha, hey, my\nPippin!\u2019 he said, and the other Ents all stopped their chant. \u2018You are\na hasty folk, I was forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening\nto a speech you do not understand. You may get down now. I have\ntold your names to the Entmoot, and they have seen you, and they\nhave agreed that you are not Orcs, and that a new line shall be put\nin the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that is quick work\nfor an Entmoot. You and Merry can stroll about in the dingle, if you\nlike. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away\nyonder in the north bank. There are still some words to speak before\nthe Moot really begins. I will come and see you again, and tell you\nhow things are going.\u2019\nHe put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed\nlow. This feat seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the\ntone of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon\nturned back to their own business. Merry and Pippin climbed up the\npath that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in\nthe great hedge. Long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle,\nand away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge there\nrose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. Southwards to\ntheir left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey\ndistance. There far away there was a pale green glimmer that Merry\nguessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan.\n\u2018I wonder where Isengard is?\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know quite where we are,\u2019 said Merry; \u2018but that peak is\nprobably Methedras, and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard\nlies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably\ndown behind this great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze\nover there, left of the peak, don\u2019t you think?\u2019\n\u2018What is Isengard like?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I wonder what Ents can do\nabout it anyway.\u2019\n\u2018So do I,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills,\nI think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the\nmiddle, called Orthanc. Saruman has a tower on it. There is a gate,\nperhaps more than one, in the encircling wall, and I believe there is\na stream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and\nflows on across the Gap of Rohan. It does not seem the sort of\nplace for Ents to tackle. But I have an odd feeling about these Ents:\nsomehow I don\u2019t think they are quite as safe and, well, funny as they\nseem. They seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet I\nbelieve they could be roused. If that happened, I wouldrather not be"}

But they don\u2019t\nlike being roused. Treebeard got roused himself last night, and then\nbottled it up again.\u2019\nThe hobbits turned back. The voices of the Ents were still rising\nand falling in their conclave. The sun had now risen high enough to\nlook over the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and\nlit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light. There\nthey saw a little glittering fountain. They walked along the rim of\nthe great bowl at the feet of the evergreens \u2013 it was pleasant to feel\ncool grass about their toes again, and not to be in a hurry \u2013 and then\nthey climbed down to the gushing water. They drank a little, a clean,\ncold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy stone, watching the\npatches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds\npassing over the floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents went\non. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world,\nand far from everything that had ever happened to them. A great\nlonging came over them for the faces and voices of their companions,\nespecially for Frodo and Sam, and for Strider.\nAt last there came a pause in the Ent-voices; and looking up they\nsaw Treebeard coming towards them, with another Ent at his side.\n\u2018Hm, hoom, here I am again,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018Are you getting\nweary, or feeling impatient, hmm, eh? Well, I am afraid that you\nmust not get impatient yet. We have finished the first stage now; but\nI have still got to explain things again to those that live a long way\noff, far from Isengard, and those that I could not get round to before\nthe Moot, and after that we shall have to decide what to do. However,\ndeciding what to do does not take Ents so long as going over all the\nfacts and events that they have to make up their minds about. Still,\nit is no use denying, we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of\ndays very likely. So I have brought you a companion. He has an\nent-house nearby. Bregalad is his Elvish name. He says he has already\nmade up his mind and does not need to remain at the Moot. Hm,\nhm, he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent. You ought to\nget on together. Good-bye!\u2019 Treebeard turned and left them.\nBregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and\nthey looked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of\n\u2018hastiness\u2019. He was tall, and seemed to be one of the younger Ents;\nhe had smooth shining skin on his arms and legs; his lips were ruddy,\nand his hair was grey-green. He could bend and sway like a slender\ntreeinthewind.Atlasthespoke,andhisvoicethoughresonantwas"}
{"507": "that is Quickbeam in your language. But it is only a nickname, of\ncourse. They have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent\nbefore he had finished his question. Also I drink quickly, and go out\nwhile some are still wetting their beards. Come with me!\u2019\nHe reached down two shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand\nto each of the hobbits. All that day they walked about, in the woods\nwith him, singing, and laughing; for Quickbeam often laughed. He\nlaughed if the sun came out from behind a cloud, he laughed if they\ncame upon a stream or spring: then he stooped and splashed his feet\nand head with water; he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper\nin the trees. Whenever he saw a rowan-tree he halted a while with\nhis arms stretched out, and sang, and swayed as he sang.\nAt nightfall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than\na mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank. Rowan-trees grew\nin a circle about it, and there was water (as in all ent-houses), a spring\nbubbling out from the bank. They talked for a while as darkness fell\non the forest. Not far away the voices of the Entmoot could be heard\nstill going on; but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and\nevery now and again one great voice would rise in a high and quicken-\ning music, while all the others died away. But beside them Bregalad\nspoke gently in their own tongue, almost whispering; and they learned\nthat he belonged to Skinbark\u2019s people, and the country where they\nhad lived had been ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough\nto explain his \u2018hastiness\u2019, at least in the matter of Orcs.\n\u2018There were rowan-trees in my home,\u2019 said Bregalad, softly and\nsadly, \u2018rowan-trees that took root when I was an Enting, many many\nyears ago in the quiet of the world. The oldest were planted by the\nEnts to try and please the Entwives; but they looked at them and\nsmiled and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit\nwere growing. Yet there are no trees of all that race, the people of\nthe Rose, that are so beautiful to me. And these trees grew and grew,\ntill the shadow of each was like a green hall, and their red berries in\nthe autumn were a burden, and a beauty and a wonder. Birds used\nto flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and the rowan\nhas enough and to spare. But the birds became unfriendly and greedy\nand tore at the trees, and threw the fruit down and did not eat it.\nThen Orcs came with axes and cut down my trees. I came and called\nthem by their long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear\nor answer: they lay dead.\nO Orofarne\u00a8, Lassemista, Carnim\u00b4\u0131rie\u00a8!\nO rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay!"}
{"508": "Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft!\nO rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey;\nYour crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day.\nO Orofarne\u00a8, Lassemista, Carnim\u00b4\u0131rie\u00a8!\u2019\nThe hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of Bregalad,\nthat seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had\nloved.\nThe next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go\nfar from his \u2018house\u2019. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter\nof the bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer;\nthere was little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents\nat the Moot still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes\nlow and sad, sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as\na dirge. A second night came and still the Ents held conclave under\nhurrying clouds and fitful stars.\nThe third day broke, bleak and windy. At sunrise the Ents\u2019 voices\nrose to a great clamour and then died down again. As the morning\nwore on the wind fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy. The\nhobbits could see that Bregalad was now listening intently, although\nto them, down in the dell of his ent-house, the sound of the Moot\nwas faint.\nThe afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the moun-\ntains, sent out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of\nthe clouds. Suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet;\nthe whole forest stood in listening silence. Of course, the Ent-voices\nhad stopped. What did that mean? Bregalad was standing up erect\nand tense, looking back northwards towards Derndingle.\nThen with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah! The\ntrees quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was\nanother pause, and then a marching music began like solemn drums,\nand above the rolling beats and booms there welled voices singing\nhigh and strong.\nWe come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!\nThe Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:\nWe come, we come with horn and drum: ta-ru\u00afna ru\u00afna ru\u00afna rom!"}
{"509": "Before long they saw the marching line approaching: the Ents\nwere swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them.\nTreebeard was at their head, and some fifty followers were behind\nhim, two abreast, keeping step with their feet and beating time with\ntheir hands upon their flanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker\nof their eyes could be seen.\n\u2018Hoom, hom! Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!\u2019\ncalled Treebeard when he caught sight of Bregalad and the hobbits.\n\u2018Come, join the Moot! We are off. We are off to Isengard!\u2019\n\u2018To Isengard!\u2019 the Ents cried in many voices.\n\u2018To Isengard!\u2019\nTo Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of\nstone;\nThough Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as\nbone,\nWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;\nFor bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars \u2013 we go to\nwar!\nTo land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we\ncome, we come;\nTo Isengard with doom we come!\nWith doom we come, with doom we come!\nSo they sang as they marched southwards.\nBregalad, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside Treebeard.\nThe old Ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders\nagain, and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company\nwith beating hearts and heads held high. Though they had expected\nsomething to happen eventually, they were amazed at the change\nthat had come over the Ents. It seemed now as sudden as the bursting\nof a flood that had long been held back by a dike.\n\u2018The Ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn\u2019t\nthey?\u2019 Pippin ventured to say after some time, when for a moment\nthe singing paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard.\n\u2018Quickly?\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I\nexpected. Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an\nage. We Ents do not like being roused; and we never are roused\nunless it is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger.\nThat has not happened in this Forest since the wars of Sauron and\nthe Men of the Sea. It is the orc-work, the wanton hewing \u2013 ra\u00b4rum"}
{"510": "Wizards ought to know better: they do know better. There is no\ncurse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such\ntreachery. Down with Saruman!\u2019\n\u2018Will you really break the doors of Isengard?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps,\nhow strong we are. Maybe you have heard of Trolls? They are mighty\nstrong. But Trolls are only counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the\nGreat Darkness, in mockery of Ents, as Orcs were of Elves. We are\nstronger than Trolls. We are made of the bones of the earth. We can\nsplit stone like the roots of trees, only quicker, far quicker, if our\nminds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire or\nblast of sorcery, we could split Isengard into splinters and crack its\nwalls into rubble.\u2019\n\u2018But Saruman will try to stop you, won\u2019t he?\u2019\n\u2018Hm, ah, yes, that is so. I have not forgotten it. Indeed I have\nthought long about it. But, you see, many of the Ents are younger\nthan I am, by many lives of trees. They are all roused now, and their\nmind is all on one thing: breaking Isengard. But they will start think-\ning again before long; they will cool down a little, when we take our\nevening drink. What a thirst we shall have! But let them march now\nand sing! We have a long way to go, and there is time ahead for\nthought. It is something to have started.\u2019\nTreebeard marched on, singing with the others for a while. But\nafter a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin\ncould see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted. At last he\nlooked up, and Pippin could see a sad look in his eyes, sad but not\nunhappy. There was a light in them, as if the green flame had sunk\ndeeper into the dark wells of his thought.\n\u2018Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,\u2019 he said slowly, \u2018likely\nenough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents.\nBut if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us\nanyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our\nhearts; and that is why we are marching now. It was not a hasty\nresolve. Now at least the last march of the Ents may be worth a song.\nAye,\u2019 he sighed, \u2018we may help the other peoples before we pass away.\nStill, I should have liked to see the songs come true about the\nEntwives. I should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But\nthere, my friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time\nand their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.\u2019\nThe Ents went striding on at a great pace.

The number of the Ents had grown \u2013 or\nwhat was happening? Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed\nshould lie, he thought he saw groves of trees. But they were moving!\nCould it be that the trees of Fangorn were awake, and the forest was\nrising, marching over the hills to war? He rubbed his eyes wondering\nif sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great grey shapes\nmoved steadily onward. There was a noise like wind in many\nbranches. The Ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now,\nand all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing\nwas to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of\nthe Ents, and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting\nleaves. At last they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a\ndark pit: the great cleft at the end of the mountains: Nan Curun\u00b4\u0131r,\nthe Valley of Saruman.\n\u2018Night lies over Isengard,\u2019 said Treebeard."}

At dawn the companions had\nmade such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they\nwere getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.\n\u2018And do not forget that old man!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018I should be happier\nif I could see the print of a boot.\u2019\n\u2018Why would that make you happy?\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more\nthan he seemed,\u2019 answered the Dwarf.\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said the Elf; \u2018but a heavy boot might leave no print here:\nthe grass is deep and springy.\u2019\n\u2018That would not baffle a Ranger,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018A bent blade is\nenough for Aragorn to read. But I do not expect him to find any\ntraces. It was an evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night. I\nam sure of it, even under the light of morning. His eyes are looking\nout on us from Fangorn even now, maybe.\u2019\n\u2018It is likely enough,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018yet I am not sure. I am thinking\nof the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away.\nBut I did not think so. Did you hear them, Legolas? Did they sound\nto you like beasts in terror?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and\nour own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with\nsome sudden gladness. They spoke as horses will when they meet a\nfriend that they have long missed.\u2019\n\u2018So I thought,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018but I cannot read the riddle, unless\nthey return. Come! The light is growing fast. Let us look first and\nguess later! We should begin here, near to our own camping-ground,\nsearching carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the\nforest. To find the hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of\nour visitor in the night. If they escaped by some chance, then they\nmust have hidden in the trees, or they would have been seen. If we\nfind nothing between here and the eaves of the wood, then we will\nmake a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes. But\nthere is little hope there: the horsemen of Rohan did their work too\nwell.\u2019"}
{"513": "hanging limp, and rattling in the chill easterly wind. Aragorn moved\nslowly away. He came to the ashes of the watch-fire near the river-\nbank, and then began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll\nwhere the battle had been fought. Suddenly he stooped and bent low\nwith his face almost in the grass. Then he called to the others. They\ncame running up.\n\u2018Here at last we find news!\u2019 said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken\nleaf for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and\nturning brown. \u2018Here is a mallorn-leaf of Lo\u00b4rien, and there are small\ncrumbs on it, and a few more crumbs in the grass. And see! there\nare some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!\u2019\n\u2018And here is the knife that cut them!\u2019 said Gimli. He stooped and\ndrew out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it,\na short jagged blade. The haft from which it had been snapped was\nbeside it. \u2018It was an orc-weapon,\u2019 he said, holding it gingerly, and\nlooking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a\nhideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.\n\u2018Well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!\u2019\nexclaimed Legolas. \u2018A bound prisoner escapes both from the Orcs\nand from the surrounding horsemen. He then stops, while still in the\nopen, and cuts his bonds with an orc-knife. But how and why? For\nif his legs were tied, how did he walk? And if his arms were tied, how\ndid he use the knife? And if neither were tied, why did he cut the\ncords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly\nate some waybread! That at least is enough to show that he was a\nhobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he turned his\narms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should be\neasy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!\u2019\n\u2018There was sorcery here right enough,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018What was that\nold man doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of\nLegolas. Can you better it?\u2019\n\u2018Maybe, I could,\u2019 said Aragorn, smiling. \u2018There are some other\nsigns near at hand that you have not considered. I agree that the\nprisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free,\nbefore he came here. I guess that it was hands, because the riddle\nthen becomes easier, and also because, as I read the marks, he was\ncarried to this point by an Orc. Blood was spilled there, a few paces\naway, orc-blood. There are deep prints of hoofs all about this spot,\nand signs that a heavy thing was dragged away. The Orc was slain\nby horsemen, and later his body was hauled to the fire. But the hobbit\nwas not seen: he was not \u2018\u2018in the open\u2019\u2019, for it was night and he still\nhad his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to"}
{"514": "it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even\nthough he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a\nhobbit.

There is, however, nothing to show that for\ncertain.\u2019\n\u2018And how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have\na hand free?\u2019 asked Gimli.\n\u2018I do not know how it happened,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018Nor do I\nknow why an Orc was carrying them away. Not to help them to\nescape, we may be sure. Nay, rather I think that I now begin to\nunderstand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why\nwhen Boromir had fallen were the Orcs content with the capture of\nMerry and Pippin? They did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack\nour camp; but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard.\nDid they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his faithful\ncomrade? I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such\nplain orders to Orcs, even if they knew so much themselves; they\nwould not speak openly to them of the Ring: they are not trusty\nservants. But I think the Orcs had been commanded to capture hob-\nbits, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made to slip out with the\nprecious prisoners before the battle. Treachery perhaps, likely enough\nwith such folk; some large and bold Orc may have been trying to\nescape with the prize alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale.\nOthers might be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one\nat least of our friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help\nhim before we return to Rohan. We must not be daunted by Fangorn,\nsince need drove him into that dark place.\u2019\n\u2018I do not know which daunts me more: Fangorn, or the thought\nof the long road through Rohan on foot,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Then let us go to the forest,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nIt was not long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point,\nnear the bank of the Entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints,\nbut too light for much to be made of them. Then again beneath\nthe bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints\nwere discovered. The earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal\nmuch.\n\u2018One hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and\nthen he turned away into the forest,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Then we must go in, too,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But I do not like the look\nof this Fangorn; and we were warned against it. I wish the chase had\nled anywhere else!\u2019"}
{"515": "as if he were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows.\n\u2018No, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away.

There is something happening inside, or going to happen. Do\nyou not feel the tenseness?

Let us go!\u2019\nWith that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn.\nLegolas and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for\nhim to see. The floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift\nof leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water,\nhe returned often to the banks of the stream. So it was that he came\nupon the place where Merry and Pippin had drunk and bathed their\nfeet. There plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits,\none somewhat smaller than the other.\n\u2018This is good tidings,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Yet the marks are two days\nold. And it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-\nside.\u2019\n\u2018Then what shall we do now?\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018We cannot pursue them\nthrough the whole fastness of Fangorn. We have come ill supplied.\nIf we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except\nto sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together.\u2019\n\u2018If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Let us go on.\u2019\nThey came at length to the steep abrupt end of Treebeard\u2019s Hill,\nand looked up at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the"}
{"516": "\u2018Let us go up and look about us!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I still feel my\nbreath short. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.\u2019\nThe companions climbed up. Aragorn came last, moving slowly:\nhe was scanning the steps and ledges closely.\n\u2018I am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018But there are other marks, very strange marks, which I do not under-\nstand. I wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will\nhelp us to guess which way they went next?\u2019\nHe stood up and looked about, but he saw nothing that was of\nany use. The shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the\neast was the view open. There he could see the heads of the trees\ndescending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come.\n\u2018We have journeyed a long way round,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018We could\nhave all come here safe together, if we had left the Great River on\nthe second or third day and struck west. Few can foresee whither\ntheir road will lead them, till they come to its end.\u2019\n\u2018But we did not wish to come to Fangorn,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Yet here we are \u2013 and nicely caught in the net,\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Look!\u2019\n\u2018Look at what?\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018There in the trees.\u2019\n\u2018Where? I have not elf-eyes.\u2019\n\u2018Hush! Speak more softly! Look!\u2019 said Legolas pointing. \u2018Down in\nthe wood, back in the way that we have just come. It is he. Cannot\nyou see him, passing from tree to tree?\u2019\n\u2018I see, I see now!\u2019 hissed Gimli. \u2018Look, Aragorn! Did I not warn\nyou? There is the old man. All in dirty grey rags: that is why I could\nnot see him at first.\u2019\nAragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly. It was\nnot far away. It looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily,\nleaning on a rough staff. His head was bowed, and he did not look\ntowards them. In other lands they would have greeted him with kind\nwords; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy:\nsomething was approaching that held a hidden power \u2013 or menace.\nGimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure\ndrew nearer. Then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he\nburst out: \u2018Your bow, Legolas! Bend it! Get ready! It is Saruman.\nDo not let him speak, or put a spell upon us! Shoot first!\u2019\nLegolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will\nresisted him. He held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it\nto the string. Aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent.\n\u2018Why are you waiting? What is the matter with you?\u2019 said Gimli"}
{"517": "man so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be\non us. Watch and wait!\u2019\nAt that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with\nsurprising speed to the foot of the rock-wall. Then suddenly he looked\nup, while they stood motionless looking down. There was no sound.\nThey could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he\nwore a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were overshadowed,\nexcept for the end of his nose and his grey beard. Yet it seemed to\nAragorn that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within\nthe shadow of the hooded brows.\nAt last the old man broke the silence. \u2018Well met indeed, my\nfriends,\u2019 he said in a soft voice. \u2018I wish to speak to you. Will you\ncome down, or shall I come up?\u2019 Without waiting for an answer he\nbegan to climb.\n\u2018Now!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018Stop him, Legolas!\u2019\n\u2018Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?\u2019 said the old man.\n\u2018Put away that bow, Master Elf !\u2019\nThe bow and arrow fell from Legolas\u2019 hands, and his arms hung\nloose at his sides.\n\u2018And you, Master Dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft,\ntill I am up! You will not need such arguments.\u2019\nGimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old\nman sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. All weariness\nseemed to have left him. As he stepped up on to the shelf there was\na gleam, too brief for certainty, a quick glint of white, as if some\ngarment shrouded by the grey rags had been for an instant revealed.\nThe intake of Gimli\u2019s breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the\nsilence.\n\u2018Well met, I say again!\u2019 said the old man, coming towards them.\nWhen he was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with\nhis head thrust forward, peering at them from under his hood. \u2018And\nwhat may you be doing in these parts? An Elf, a Man, and a Dwarf,\nall clad in Elvish fashion. No doubt there is a tale worth hearing\nbehind it all. Such things are not often seen here.\u2019\n\u2018You speak as one that knows Fangorn well,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Is that\nso?\u2019\n\u2018Not well,\u2019 said the old man: \u2018that would be the study of many\nlives. But I come here now and again.\u2019\n\u2018Might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have\nto say to us?\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018The morning passes, and we have an"}
{"518": "doing, and what tale can you tell of yourselves? As for my name!\u2019 He\nbroke off, laughing long and softly. Aragorn felt a shudder run\nthrough him at the sound, a strange cold thrill; and yet it was not\nfear or terror that he felt: rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen\nair, or the slap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper.\n\u2018My name!\u2019 said the old man again. \u2018Have you not guessed it\nalready? You have heard it before, I think. Yes, you have heard it\nbefore. But come now, what of your tale?\u2019\nThe three companions stood silent and made no answer.\n\u2018There are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand\nis fit to tell,\u2019 said the old man. \u2018Happily I know something of it. You\nare tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits, I believe. Yes, hob-\nbits. Don\u2019t stare, as if you had never heard the strange name before.\nYou have, and so have I. Well, they climbed up here the day before\nyesterday; and they met someone that they did not expect. Does that\ncomfort you? And now you would like to know where they were\ntaken? Well, well, maybe I can give you some news about that. But\nwhy are we standing? Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent\nas you thought. Let us sit down and be more at ease.\u2019\nThe old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones\nand rock at the foot of the cliff behind. Immediately, as if a spell had\nbeen removed, the others relaxed and stirred. Gimli\u2019s hand went at\nonce to his axe-haft. Aragorn drew his sword. Legolas picked up his\nbow.\nThe old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a\nlow flat stone. Then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond\ndoubt, that he was clothed beneath all in white.\n\u2018Saruman!\u2019 cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand.\n\u2018Speak! Tell us where you have hidden our friends! What have you\ndone with them? Speak, or I will make a dint in your hat that even\na wizard will find it hard to deal with!\u2019\nThe old man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and\nleaped to the top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly\ntall, towering above them. His hood and his grey rags were flung\naway. His white garments shone. He lifted up his staff, and Gimli\u2019s\naxe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. The sword\nof Aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire.\nLegolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it\nvanished in a flash of flame.\n\u2018Mithrandir!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Mithrandir!\u2019\n\u2018Well met, I say to you again, Legolas!\u2019 said the old man."}
{"519": "bright, piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between\nwonder, joy, and fear they stood and found no words to say.\nAt last Aragorn stirred. \u2018Gandalf !\u2019 he said. \u2018Beyond all hope you\nreturn to us in our need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf !\u2019\nGimli said nothing, but sank to his knees, shading his eyes.\n\u2018Gandalf,\u2019 the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory\na long disused word. \u2018Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.\u2019\nHe stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak\nwrapped it about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but\nnow was hid in cloud again. \u2018Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,\u2019 he\nsaid, and the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide. \u2018Get\nup, my good Gimli! No blame to you, and no harm done to me.\nIndeed my friends, none of you have any weapon that could hurt\nme. Be merry! We meet again. At the turn of the tide. The great\nstorm is coming, but the tide has turned.\u2019\nHe laid his hand on Gimli\u2019s head, and the Dwarf looked up and\nlaughed suddenly. \u2018Gandalf !\u2019 he said. \u2018But you are all in white!\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I am white now,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Indeed I am Saruman, one\nmight almost say, Saruman as he should have been. But come now,\ntell me of yourselves! I have passed through fire and deep water,\nsince we parted. I have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and\nlearned again much that I had forgotten. I can see many things far\noff, but many things that are close at hand I cannot see. Tell me of\nyourselves!\u2019\n\u2018What do you wish to know?\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018All that has happened\nsince we parted on the bridge would be a long tale. Will you not first\ngive us news of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?\u2019\n\u2018No, I did not find them,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018There was a darkness\nover the valleys of the Emyn Muil, and I did not know of their\ncaptivity, until the eagle told me.\u2019\n\u2018The eagle!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I have seen an eagle high and far off:\nthe last time was four days ago, above the Emyn Muil.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018that was Gwaihir the Windlord, who rescued\nme from Orthanc. I sent him before me to watch the River and gather\ntidings. His sight is keen, but he cannot see all that passes under hill\nand tree. Some things he has seen, and others I have seen myself.\nThe Ring now has passed beyond my help, or the help of any of the\nCompany that set out from Rivendell. Very nearly it was revealed to\nthe Enemy, but it escaped. I had some part in that: for I sat in a high\nplace, and I strove with the Dark Tower; and the Shadow passed.\nThen I was weary, very weary; and I walked long in dark thought.\u2019"}
{"520": "\u2018I cannot say. He was saved from a great peril, but many lie before\nhim still. He resolved to go alone to Mordor, and he set out: that is\nall that I can say.\u2019\n\u2018Not alone,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018We think that Sam went with him.\u2019\n\u2018Did he!\u2019 said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a\nsmile on his face. \u2018Did he indeed? It is news to me, yet it does not\nsurprise me. Good! Very good! You lighten my heart. You must tell\nme more. Now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.\u2019\nThe companions sat on the ground at his feet, and Aragorn took\nup the tale. For a long while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no\nquestions. His hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were\nclosed. At last when Aragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of\nhis last journey upon the Great River, the old man sighed.\n\u2018You have not said all that you know or guess, Aragorn my friend,\u2019\nhe said quietly. \u2018Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to\nhim. It was a sore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men.\nGaladriel told me that he was in peril. But he escaped in the end. I\nam glad. It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if\nonly for Boromir\u2019s sake. But that is not the only part they have to\nplay. They were brought to Fangorn, and their coming was like the\nfalling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains. Even\nas we talk here, I hear the first rumblings. Saruman had best not be\ncaught away from home when the dam bursts!\u2019\n\u2018In one thing you have not changed, dear friend,\u2019 said Aragorn:\n\u2018you still speak in riddles.\u2019\n\u2018What? In riddles?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018No! For I was talking aloud to\nmyself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to\nspeak to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.\u2019\nHe laughed, but the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam\nof sunshine.\n\u2018I am no longer young even in the reckoning of Men of the Ancient\nHouses,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Will you not open your mind more clearly\nto me?\u2019\n\u2018What then shall I say?\u2019 said Gandalf, and paused for a while in\nthought. \u2018This in brief is how I see things at the moment, if you wish\nto have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of\ncourse, has long known that the Ring is abroad, and that it is borne\nby a hobbit. He knows now the number of our Company that set\nout from Rivendell, and the kind of each of us. But he does not yet\nperceive our purpose clearly. He supposes that we were all going to\nMinas Tirith; for that is what he would himself have done in our"}
{"521": "one may suddenly appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with\nwar, seeking to cast him down and take his place. That we should\nwish to cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought\nthat occurs to his mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself\nhas not yet entered into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you\nwill see our good fortune and our hope. For imagining war he has\nlet loose war, believing that he has no time to waste; for he that\nstrikes the first blow, if he strikes it hard enough, may need to strike\nno more. So the forces that he has long been preparing he is now\nsetting in motion, sooner than he intended. Wise fool. For if he had\nused all his power to guard Mordor, so that none could enter, and\nbent all his guile to the hunting of the Ring, then indeed hope would\nhave faded: neither Ring nor bearer could long have eluded him. But\nnow his eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he\nlooks towards Minas Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon\nit like a storm.\n\u2018For already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay\nthe Company have failed again. They have not found the Ring.\nNeither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages. Had they\ndone even so much as that, it would have been a heavy blow to us,\nand it might have been fatal. But let us not darken our hearts by\nimagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the Dark Tower. For the\nEnemy has failed \u2013 so far. Thanks to Saruman.\u2019\n\u2018Then is not Saruman a traitor?\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Indeed yes,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Doubly. And is not that strange? Noth-\ning that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason\nof Isengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown\nvery strong. He threatens the Men of Rohan and draws off their help\nfrom Minas Tirith, even as the main blow is approaching from the\nEast. Yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. Saruman\nalso had a mind to capture the Ring, for himself, or at least to snare\nsome hobbits for his evil purposes. So between them our enemies\nhave contrived only to bring Merry and Pippin with marvellous speed,\nand in the nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they would\nnever have come at all!\n\u2018Also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb\ntheir plans. No tidings of the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to\nthe horsemen of Rohan; but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits\nwere taken in the Emyn Muil and borne away towards Isengard\nagainst the will of his own servants. He now has Isengard to fear as\nwell as Minas Tirith. If Minas Tirith falls, it will go ill with Saruman.\u2019\n\u2018Itis apitythat ourfriends lieinbetween,\u2019 saidGimli.\u2018If noland"}
{"522": "\u2018The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from\ndoubt,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But Isengard cannot fight Mordor, unless\nSaruman first obtains the Ring. That he will never do now. He does\nnot yet know his peril. There is much that he does not know. He\nwas so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at\nhome, and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers. But\nhe came too late, for once, and the battle was over and beyond his\nhelp before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. I\nlook into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He\nbelieves that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of\nbattle; but he does not know whether the Orcs were bringing any\nprisoners or not. And he does not know of the quarrel between his\nservants and the Orcs of Mordor; nor does he know of the Winged\nMessenger.\u2019\n\u2018The Winged Messenger!\u2019 cried Legolas. \u2018I shot at him with the\nbow of Galadriel above Sarn Gebir, and I felled him from the sky.\nHe filled us all with fear. What new terror is this?\u2019\n\u2018One that you cannot slay with arrows,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You only\nslew his steed. It was a good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed\nagain. For he was a Nazgu\u02c6l, one of the Nine, who ride now upon\nwinged steeds. Soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of\nour friends, cutting off the sun. But they have not yet been allowed\nto cross the River, and Saruman does not know of this new shape in\nwhich the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought is ever on the\nRing. Was it present in the battle? Was it found? What if The\u00b4oden,\nLord of the Mark, should come by it and learn of its power? That is\nthe danger that he sees, and he has fled back to Isengard to double\nand treble his assault on Rohan. And all the time there is another\ndanger, close at hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery\nthoughts. He has forgotten Treebeard.\u2019\n\u2018Now you speak to yourself again,\u2019 said Aragorn with a smile.\n\u2018Treebeard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of Saruman\u2019s\ndouble treachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of two\nhobbits to Fangorn has served, save to give us a long and fruitless\nchase.\u2019\n\u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018There is another thing that I should\nlike to know first. Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last\nnight?\u2019\n\u2018You certainly did not see me,\u2019 answered Gandalf, \u2018therefore I\nmust guess that you saw Saruman. Evidently we look so much alike\nthat your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be\nexcused.\u2019"}
{"523": "comfort not to be mistaken at all points. Do I not know it only too\nwell! But, of course, I never blamed you for your welcome of me.\nHow could I do so, who have so often counselled my friends to\nsuspect even their own hands when dealing with the Enemy. Bless\nyou, Gimli, son of Glo\u00b4 in! Maybe you will see us both together one\nday and judge between us!\u2019\n\u2018But the hobbits!\u2019 Legolas broke in. \u2018We have come far to seek\nthem, and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?\u2019\n\u2018With Treebeard and the Ents,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018The Ents!\u2019 exclaimed Aragorn. \u2018Then there is truth in the old\nlegends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds\nof the trees? Are there still Ents in the world? I thought they were\nonly a memory of ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than\na legend of Rohan.\u2019\n\u2018A legend of Rohan!\u2019 cried Legolas. \u2018Nay, every Elf in Wilderland\nhas sung songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even\namong us they are only a memory. If I were to meet one still walking\nin this world, then indeed I should feel young again! But Treebeard:\nthat is only a rendering of Fangorn into the Common Speech; yet\nyou seem to speak of a person. Who is this Treebeard?\u2019\n\u2018Ah! now you are asking much,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The little that I\nknow of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no\ntime now. Treebeard is Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the\noldest of the Ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the\nSun upon this Middle-earth. I hope indeed, Legolas, that you may\nyet meet him. Merry and Pippin have been fortunate: they met him\nhere, even where we sit. For he came here two days ago and bore\nthem away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. He\noften comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours\nof the world outside trouble him. I saw him four days ago striding\namong the trees, and I think he saw me, for he paused; but I did not\nspeak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with\nthe Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps he also thought that you were Saruman,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018But you speak of him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was\ndangerous.\u2019\n\u2018Dangerous!\u2019 cried Gandalf. \u2018And so am I, very dangerous: more\ndangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought\nalive before the seat of the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous,\nand Legolas is dangerous. You are beset with dangers, Gimli son of\nGlo\u00b4 in; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion.

A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds\nfell on his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed\nto be filled with light as a cup is with water. At last he looked up\nand gazed straight at the sun.\n\u2018The morning is wearing away,\u2019 he said. \u2018Soon we must go.\u2019\n\u2018Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?\u2019 asked Aragorn.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018That is not the road that you must take. I\nhave spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory.\nWar is upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of\nthe Ring could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow\nand great fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am\nGandalf, Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.\u2019\nHe rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw\nthings far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head.\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said in a soft voice, \u2018it has gone beyond our reach. Of that\nat least let us be glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring.\nWe must go down to face a peril near despair, yet that deadly peril\nis removed.\u2019\nHe turned. \u2018Come, Aragorn son of Arathorn!\u2019 he said. \u2018Do not\nregret your choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil, nor call it a vain\npursuit. You chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice\nwas just, and it has been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who\notherwise might have met too late.

The others gazed at them in silence as they stood\nthere facing one another. The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son\nof Arathorn, was tall, and stern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of\nhis sword; he looked as if some king out of the mists of the sea had\nstepped upon the shores of lesser men. Before him stooped the old\nfigure, white, shining now as if with some light kindled within, bent,\nladen with years, but holding a power beyond the strength of kings.\n\u2018Do I not say truly, Gandalf,\u2019 said Aragorn at last, \u2018that you could\ngo whithersoever you wished quicker than I? And this I also say: you\nare our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we\nhave One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed\nthrough the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go\nwhere he leads.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, together we will follow you,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018But first, it would\nease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you in Moria. Will you\nnot tell us? Can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were\ndelivered?\u2019\n\u2018I have stayed already too long,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018Time is short.\nBut if there were a year to spend, I would not tell you all.\u2019\n\u2018Then tell us what you will, and time allows!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Come,\nGandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!\u2019\n\u2018Name him not!\u2019 said Gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that\na cloud of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as\ndeath. \u2018Long time I fell,\u2019 he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back\nwith difficulty. \u2018Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about\nme. I was burned. Then we plunged into the deep water and all was\ndark. Cold it was as the tide of death: almost it froze my heart.\u2019\n\u2018Deep is the abyss that is spanned by Durin\u2019s Bridge, and none\nhas measured it,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Yet it has a bottom, beyond light and knowledge,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Thither I came at last, to the uttermost foundations of stone. He\nwas with me still. His fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of\nslime, stronger than a strangling snake.\n\u2018We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted.\nEver he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into\ndark tunnels.

Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about\nus, vapour and steam. Ice fell like rain. I threw down my enemy, and\nhe fell from the high place and broke the mountain-side where he\nsmote it in his ruin. Then darkness took me, and I strayed out of\nthought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will not tell.\n\u2018Naked I was sent back \u2013 for a brief time, until my task is done.\nAnd naked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was\ncrumbled into dust, the window gone; the ruined stair was choked\nwith burned and broken stone. I was alone, forgotten, without escape\nupon the hard horn of the world. There I lay staring upward, while\nthe stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the\nearth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all lands: the\nspringing and the dying, the song and the weeping, and the slow\neverlasting groan of over-burdened stone. And so at the last Gwaihir\nthe Windlord found me again, and he took me up and bore me away.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Ever am I fated to be your burden, friend at need,\u2019\u2019 I said.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018A burden you have been,\u2019\u2019 he answered, \u2018\u2018but not so now.

I\nhave not seen his like before.\u2019\n\u2018Nor will you again,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018That is Shadowfax. He is the\nchief of the Mearas, lords of horses, and not even The\u00b4oden, King of\nRohan, has ever looked on a better. Does he not shine like silver,\nand run as smoothly as a swift stream? He has come for me: the\nhorse of the White Rider. We are going to battle together.\u2019\nEven as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came striding up\nthe slope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing\nin the wind of his speed. The two others followed, now far behind.\nAs soon as Shadowfax saw Gandalf, he checked his pace and whin-\nnied loudly; then trotting gently forward he stooped his proud head\nand nuzzled his great nostrils against the old man\u2019s neck.\nGandalf caressed him. \u2018It is a long way from Rivendell, my friend,\u2019\nhe said; \u2018but you are wise and swift and come at need.

After a little while\nhe turned suddenly, and choosing a place where the banks were\nlower, he waded the river, and then led them away due south into a\nflat land, treeless and wide. The wind went like grey waves through\nthe endless miles of grass. There was no sign of road or track, but\nShadowfax did not stay or falter.\n\u2018He is steering a straight course now for the halls of The\u00b4oden\nunder the slopes of the White Mountains,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It will be\nquicker so.

Slowly the sun fell from the\nsky down into the West.

Legolas and\nGimli slept, and Aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gan-\ndalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and\nwest. All was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living thing.\nThe night was barred with long clouds, fleeting on a chill wind, when\nthey arose again.

The miles went by. The\nwaxing moon sank into the cloudy West.\nA bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the East the dark faded\nto a cold grey. Red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the\nEmyn Muil far away upon their left. Dawn came clear and bright; a\nwind swept across their path, rushing through the bent grasses.

Before them stood\nthe mountains of the South: white-tipped and streaked with black.\nThe grass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet,\nand flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the\nlight of dawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains.\nImmediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened\nlike a long gulf among the hills. Far inward they glimpsed a tumbled\nmountain-mass with one tall peak; at the mouth of the vale there\nstood like a sentinel a lonely height. About its feet there flowed, as\na thread of silver, the stream that issued from the dale; upon its brow\nthey caught, still far away, a glint in the rising sun, a glimmer of gold.\n\u2018Speak, Legolas!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Tell us what you see there before\nus!\u2019\nLegolas gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the"}

There men in\nbright mail stand; but all else within the courts are yet asleep.\u2019\n\u2018Edoras those courts are called,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and Meduseld is\nthat golden hall.

The land was green: in the wet meads and\nalong the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow-trees.\nAlready in this southern land they were blushing red at their finger-\ntips, feeling the approach of spring. Over the stream there was a ford\nbetween low banks much trampled by the passage of horses. The\ntravellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading\ntowards the uplands.\nAt the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of\nmany mounds, high and green.

A king will have his way in his own hall,\nbe it folly or wisdom.\u2019\n\u2018Truly,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018And I would do as the master of the house\nbade me, were this only a woodman\u2019s cot, if I bore now any sword\nbut Andu\u00b4ril.\u2019\n\u2018Whatever its name may be,\u2019 said Ha\u00b4ma, \u2018here you shall lay it, if\nyou would not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.\u2019\n\u2018Not alone!\u2019 said Gimli, fingering the blade of his axe, and looking\ndarkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a\nmind to fell. \u2018Not alone!\u2019\n\u2018Come, come!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We are all friends here. Or should\nbe; for the laughter of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel.\nMy errand is pressing. Here at least is my sword, goodman Ha\u00b4ma.\nKeep it well. Glamdring it is called, for the Elves made it long ago.\nNow let me pass. Come, Aragorn!\u2019\nSlowly Aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword\nupright against the wall. \u2018Here I set it,\u2019 he said; \u2018but I command you\nnot to touch it, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. In this\nElvish sheath dwells the Blade that was Broken and has been made\nagain. Telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time. Death shall come\nto any man that draws Elendil\u2019s sword save Elendil\u2019s heir.\u2019\nThe guard stepped back and looked with amazement on Aragorn.\n\u2018It seems that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten\ndays,\u2019 he said. \u2018It shall be, lord, as you command.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018if it has Andu\u00b4ril to keep it company, my axe\nmay stay here, too, without shame\u2019; and he laid it on the floor. \u2018Now\nthen, if all is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.\u2019\nThe guard still hesitated. \u2018Your staff,\u2019 he said to Gandalf. \u2018Forgive\nme, but that too must be left at the doors.\u2019\n\u2018Foolishness!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Prudence is one thing, but discour-\ntesy is another. I am old. If I may not lean on my stick as I go, then\nI will sit out here, until it pleases The\u00b4oden to hobble out himself to\nspeak with me.\u2019\nAragorn laughed. \u2018Every man has something too dear to trust to\nanother.

He looked hard at the ash-staff on which Gandalf\nleaned. \u2018Yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom.\nI believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour, who have no\nevil purpose.

{"536": "entered. Inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the\nhill. The hall was long and wide and filled with shadows and half\nlights; mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof. But here and there bright\nsunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the eastern windows, high\nunder the deep eaves. Through the louver in the roof, above the thin\nwisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and blue. As their eyes\nchanged, the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with stones\nof many hues; branching runes and strange devices intertwined\nbeneath their feet. They saw now that the pillars were richly carved,\ngleaming dully with gold and half-seen colours. Many woven cloths\nwere hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces marched figures\nof ancient legend, some dim with years, some darkling in the shade.\nBut upon one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse.\nHe was blowing a great horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the\nwind. The horse\u2019s head was lifted, and its nostrils were wide and red\nas it neighed, smelling battle afar. Foaming water, green and white,\nrushed and curled about its knees.\n\u2018Behold Eorl the Young!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Thus he rode out of the\nNorth to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.\u2019\nNow the four companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire\nburning upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall. Then they\nhalted. At the far end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing\nnorth towards the doors, was a dais with three steps; and in the\nmiddle of the dais was a great gilded chair. Upon it sat a man so\nbent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was\nlong and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden\ncirclet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a\nsingle white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees;\nbut his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at\nthe strangers. Behind his chair stood a woman clad in white. At his\nfeet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise\nface and heavy-lidded eyes.\nThere was a silence. The old man did not move in his chair. At\nlength Gandalf spoke. \u2018Hail, The\u00b4oden son of Thengel! I have\nreturned. For behold! the storm comes, and now all friends should\ngather together, lest each singly be destroyed.\u2019\nSlowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short\nblack staff with a handle of white bone; and now the strangers saw\nthat, bent though he was, he was still tall and must in youth have\nbeen high and proud indeed.\n\u2018Igreetyou,\u2019hesaid,\u2018andmaybeyoulookforwelcome.Buttruth"}
{"537": "oftener the worse. I will not deceive you: when I heard that Shadowfax\nhad come back riderless, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but\nstill more at the lack of the rider; and when E\u00b4 omer brought the tidings\nthat you had gone at last to your long home, I did not mourn. But\nnews from afar is seldom sooth. Here you come again! And with you\ncome evils worse than before, as might be expected. Why should I\nwelcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? Tell me that.\u2019 Slowly he sat down\nagain in his chair.\n\u2018You speak justly, lord,\u2019 said the pale man sitting upon the steps\nof the dais. \u2018It is not yet five days since the bitter tidings came that\nThe\u00b4odred your son was slain upon the West Marches: your right-\nhand, Second Marshal of the Mark. In E\u00b4 omer there is little trust.\nFew men would be left to guard your walls, if he had been allowed\nto rule. And even now we learn from Gondor that the Dark Lord is\nstirring in the East. Such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses\nto return. Why indeed should we welcome you, Master Stormcrow?\nLa\u00b4thspell I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill guest they say.\u2019\nHe laughed grimly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed\non the strangers with dark eyes.\n\u2018You are held wise, my friend Wormtongue, and are doubtless a\ngreat support to your master,\u2019 answered Gandalf in a soft voice. \u2018Yet\nin two ways may a man come with evil tidings. He may be a worker\nof evil; or he may be such as leaves well alone, and comes only to\nbring aid in time of need.\u2019\n\u2018That is so,\u2019 said Wormtongue; \u2018but there is a third kind: pickers\nof bones, meddlers in other men\u2019s sorrows, carrion-fowl that grow\nfat on war. What aid have you ever brought, Stormcrow? And what\naid do you bring now? It was aid from us that you sought last time\nthat you were here. Then my lord bade you choose any horse that\nyou would and be gone; and to the wonder of all you took Shadowfax\nin your insolence. My lord was sorely grieved; yet to some it seemed\nthat to speed you from the land the price was not too great. I guess\nthat it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid\nrather than render it. Do you bring men? Do you bring horses,\nswords, spears? That I would call aid; that is our present need. But\nwho are these that follow at your tail? Three ragged wanderers in\ngrey, and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four!\u2019\n\u2018The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, The\u00b4oden\nson of Thengel,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Has not the messenger from your\ngate reported the names of my companions? Seldom has any lord of\nRohan received three such guests. Weapons they have laid at your\ndoors that are worth many a mortal man, even the mightiest. Grey"}
{"538": "\u2018Then it is true, as E\u00b4omer reported, that you are in league with\nthe Sorceress of the Golden Wood?\u2019 said Wormtongue. \u2018It is not to\nbe wondered at: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.\u2019\nGimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of Gandalf\nclutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone.\nIn Dwimordene, in Lo\u00b4rien\nSeldom have walked the feet of Men,\nFew mortal eyes have seen the light\nThat lies there ever, long and bright.\nGaladriel! Galadriel!\nClear is the water of your well;\nWhite is the star in your white hand;\nUnmarred, unstained is leaf and land\nIn Dwimordene, in Lo\u00b4rien\nMore fair than thoughts of Mortal Men.\nThus Gandalf softly sang, and then suddenly he changed. Casting\nhis tattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned no longer on his\nstaff; and he spoke in a clear cold voice.\n\u2018The wise speak only of what they know, Gr\u00b4\u0131ma son of Ga\u00b4lmo\u00b4d.\nA witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your\nforked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and\ndeath to bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning\nfalls.\u2019\nHe raised his staff. There was a roll of thunder. The sunlight was\nblotted out from the eastern windows; the whole hall became sud-\ndenly dark as night. The fire faded to sullen embers. Only Gandalf\ncould be seen, standing white and tall before the blackened hearth.\nIn the gloom they heard the hiss of Wormtongue\u2019s voice: \u2018Did I\nnot counsel you, lord, to forbid his staff ? That fool, Ha\u00b4ma, has\nbetrayed us!\u2019 There was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof.\nThen all was silent. Wormtongue sprawled on his face.\n\u2018Now The\u00b4oden son of Thengel, will you hearken to me?\u2019 said\nGandalf. \u2018Do you ask for help?\u2019 He lifted his staff and pointed to a\nhigh window. There the darkness seemed to clear, and through the\nopening could be seen, high and far, a patch of shining sky. \u2018Not all\nis dark. Take courage, Lord of the Mark; for better help you will not\nfind. No counsel have I to give to those that despair. Yet counsel I\ncould give, and words I could speak to you.

{"539": "Slowly The\u00b4oden left his chair. A faint light grew in the hall again.\nThe woman hastened to the king\u2019s side, taking his arm, and with\nfaltering steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly\nthrough the hall. Wormtongue remained lying on the floor. They\ncame to the doors and Gandalf knocked.\n\u2018Open!\u2019 he cried. \u2018The Lord of the Mark comes forth!\u2019\nThe doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in.

As she passed\nthe doors she turned and looked back. Grave and thoughtful was her\nglance, as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. Very fair\nwas her face, and her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and\ntall she was in her white robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed\nand stern as steel, a daughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first\ntime in the full light of day beheld E\u00b4 owyn, Lady of Rohan, and\nthought her fair, fair and cold, like a morning of pale spring that is\nnot yet come to womanhood. And she now was suddenly aware of\nhim: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, greycloaked, hiding\na power that yet she felt. For a moment still as stone she stood, then\nturning swiftly she was gone.\n\u2018Now, lord,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018look out upon your land! Breathe the\nfree air again!\u2019\nFrom the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see\nbeyond the stream the green fields of Rohan fading into distant grey.\nCurtains of wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and\nto the west was still dark with thunder, and lightning far away\nflickered among the tops of hidden hills. But the wind had shifted\nto the north, and already the storm that had come out of the East\nwas receding, rolling away southward to the sea. Suddenly through\na rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down. The\nfalling showers gleamed like silver, and far away the river glittered\nlike a shimmering glass.\n\u2018It is not so dark here,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders\nas some would have you think.

Not long now shall stand the high hall which\nBrego son of Eorl built. Fire shall devour the high seat. What is to\nbe done?\u2019\n\u2018Much,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But first send for E\u00b4 omer. Do I not guess\nrightly that you hold him prisoner, by the counsel of Gr\u00b4\u0131ma, of him\nthat all save you name the Wormtongue?\u2019\n\u2018It is true,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018He had rebelled against my commands,\nand threatened death to Gr\u00b4\u0131ma in my hall.\u2019\n\u2018A man may love you and yet not love Wormtongue or his coun-\nsels,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018That may be.

Aragorn and his companions stood nearby.\n\u2018There is no time to tell all that you should hear,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Yet if my hope is not cheated, a time will come ere long when I can\nspeak more fully. Behold! you are come into a peril greater even than\nthe wit of Wormtongue could weave into your dreams. But see! you\ndream no longer. You live. Gondor and Rohan do not stand alone.\nThe enemy is strong beyond our reckoning, yet we have a hope at\nwhich he has not guessed.\u2019\nQuickly now Gandalf spoke. His voice was low and secret, and\nnone save the king heard what he said. But ever as he spoke the light\nshone brighter in The\u00b4oden\u2019s eye, and at the last he rose from his seat\nto his full height, and Gandalf beside him, and together they looked\nout from the high place towards the East.\n\u2018Verily,\u2019 said Gandalf, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, \u2018that\nway lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom hangs still on\na thread. Yet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for\na little while.\u2019\nThe others too now turned their eyes eastward. Over the sundering\nleagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope\nand fear bore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the\nLand of Shadow. Where now was the Ring-bearer? How thin indeed\nwas the thread upon which doom still hung! It seemed to Legolas,"}
{"541": "Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet a present threat,\nthere was a tiny tongue of flame.\nSlowly The\u00b4oden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to\nmaster him against the will of Gandalf.

No helm was on his head, no\nmail was on his breast, but in his hand he held a drawn sword; and\nas he knelt he offered the hilt to his master.\n\u2018How comes this?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden sternly. He turned towards\nE\u00b4 omer, and the men looked in wonder at him, standing now proud\nand erect. Where was the old man whom they had left crouching in\nhis chair or leaning on his stick?\n\u2018It is my doing, lord,\u2019 said Ha\u00b4ma, trembling. \u2018I understood that\nE\u00b4omer was to be set free.

Do not\nsend your faithful Gr\u00b4\u0131ma away!\u2019\n\u2018You have my pity,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018And I do not send you from\nmy side. I go myself to war with my men. I bid you come with me\nand prove your faith.\u2019\nWormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted\nlook of a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked\nhis lips with a long pale tongue. \u2018Such a resolve might be expected\nfrom a lord of the House of Eorl, old though he be,\u2019 he said. \u2018But\nthose who truly love him would spare his failing years. Yet I see that"}
{"544": "work, hear me at least in this, lord! One who knows your mind and\nhonours your commands should be left in Edoras. Appoint a faithful\nsteward. Let your counsellor Gr\u00b4\u0131ma keep all things till your return \u2013\nand I pray that we may see it, though no wise man will deem it\nhopeful.\u2019\nE\u00b4 omer laughed. \u2018And if that plea does not excuse you from war,\nmost noble Wormtongue,\u2019 he said, \u2018what office of less honour would\nyou accept? To carry a sack of meal up into the mountains \u2013 if any\nman would trust you with it?\u2019\n\u2018Nay, E\u00b4 omer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master\nWormtongue,\u2019 said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him.\n\u2018He is bold and cunning. Even now he plays a game with peril and\nwins a throw. Hours of my precious time he has wasted already.\nDown, snake!\u2019 he said suddenly in a terrible voice. \u2018Down on your\nbelly! How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the\npromised price? When all the men were dead, you were to pick your\nshare of the treasure, and take the woman you desire? Too long have\nyou watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.\u2019\nE\u00b4 omer grasped his sword. \u2018That I knew already,\u2019 he muttered.\n\u2018For that reason I would have slain him before, forgetting the law of\nthe hall. But there are other reasons.\u2019 He stepped forward, but\nGandalf stayed him with his hand.\n\u2018E\u00b4owyn is safe now,\u2019 he said. \u2018But you, Wormtongue, you have\ndone what you could for your true master. Some reward you have\nearned at least. Yet Saruman is apt to overlook his bargains. I should\nadvise you to go quickly and remind him, lest he forget your faithful\nservice.\u2019\n\u2018You lie,\u2019 said Wormtongue.\n\u2018That word comes too oft and easy from your lips,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018I do not lie. See, The\u00b4oden, here is a snake! With safety you cannot\ntake it with you, nor can you leave it behind. To slay it would be\njust. But it was not always as it now is. Once it was a man, and did\nyou service in its fashion. Give him a horse and let him go at once,\nwherever he chooses. By his choice you shall judge him.\u2019\n\u2018Do you hear this, Wormtongue?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018This is your\nchoice: to ride with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you\nare true; or to go now, whither you will. But then, if ever we meet\nagain, I shall not be merciful.\u2019\nSlowly Wormtongue rose. He looked at them with half-closed eyes.\nLast of all he scanned The\u00b4oden\u2019s face and opened his mouth as if to\nspeak. Then suddenly he drew himself up. His hands worked. His\neyes glittered. Such malice was in them that men stepped back from"}
{"545": "\u2018After him!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018See that he does no harm to any, but\ndo not hurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.\u2019\n\u2018And if any will bear him,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer.\nOne of the guards ran down the stair. Another went to the well\nat the foot of the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he\nwashed clean the stones that Wormtongue had defiled.\n\u2018Now my guests, come!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Come and take such\nrefreshment as haste allows.\u2019\nThey passed back into the great house. Already they heard below\nthem in the town the heralds crying and the war-horns blowing. For\nthe king was to ride forth as soon as the men of the town and those\ndwelling near could be armed and assembled.\nAt the king\u2019s board sat E\u00b4omer and the four guests, and there also\nwaiting upon the king was the lady E\u00b4owyn. They ate and drank\nswiftly. The others were silent while The\u00b4oden questioned Gandalf\nconcerning Saruman.\n\u2018How far back his treachery goes, who can guess?\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018He was not always evil. Once I do not doubt that he was the friend\nof Rohan; and even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful\nstill. But for long now he has plotted your ruin, wearing the mask of\nfriendship, until he was ready. In those years Wormtongue\u2019s task was\neasy, and all that you did was swiftly known in Isengard; for your land\nwas open, and strangers came and went. And ever Wormtongue\u2019s\nwhispering was in your ears, poisoning your thought, chilling your\nheart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and could do\nnothing, for your will was in his keeping.\n\u2018But when I escaped and warned you, then the mask was torn, for\nthose who would see. After that Wormtongue played dangerously,\nalways seeking to delay you, to prevent your full strength being gath-\nered. He was crafty: dulling men\u2019s wariness, or working on their fears,\nas served the occasion. Do you not remember how eagerly he urged\nthat no man should be spared on a wildgoose chase northward, when\nthe immediate peril was westward? He persuaded you to forbid E\u00b4 omer\nto pursue the raiding Orcs. If E\u00b4omer had not defied Wormtongue\u2019s\nvoice speaking with your mouth, those Orcs would have reached\nIsengard by now, bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which\nSaruman desires above all else, but at the least two members of my\nCompany, sharers of a secret hope, of which even to you, lord, I\ncannot yet speak openly. Dare you think of what they might now be\nsuffering, or what Saruman might now have learned to our\ndestruction?\u2019"}
{"546": "\u2018Say also,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018that to crooked eyes truth may wear a\nwry face.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed my eyes were almost blind,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Most of all I\nowe to you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would\ngive you a gift ere we go, at your own choosing. You have only to\nname aught that is mine. I reserve now only my sword!\u2019\n\u2018Whether I came in time or not is yet to be seen,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018But as for your gift, lord, I will choose one that will fit my need:\nswift and sure. Give me Shadowfax! He was only lent before, if loan\nwe may call it. But now I shall ride him into great hazard, setting\nsilver against black: I would not risk anything that is not my own.\nAnd already there is a bond of love between us.\u2019\n\u2018You choose well,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden; \u2018and I give him now gladly. Yet\nit is a great gift. There is none like to Shadowfax. In him one of the\nmighty steeds of old has returned. None such shall return again. And\nto you my other guests I will offer such things as may be found in\nmy armoury. Swords you do not need, but there are helms and coats\nof mail of cunning work, gifts to my fathers out of Gondor. Choose\nfrom these ere we go, and may they serve you well!\u2019\nNow men came bearing raiment of war from the king\u2019s hoard, and\nthey arrayed Aragorn and Legolas in shining mail. Helms too they\nchose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and\nset with gems, green and red and white. Gandalf took no armour;\nand Gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to\nmatch his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of Edoras\nof better make than his short corslet forged beneath the Mountain\nin the North. But he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well\nupon his round head; and a small shield he also took. It bore the\nrunning horse, white upon green, that was the emblem of the House\nof Eorl.\n\u2018May it keep you well!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018It was made for me in\nThengel\u2019s day, while still I was a boy.\u2019\nGimli bowed. \u2018I am proud, Lord of the Mark, to bear your device,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Indeed sooner would I bear a horse than be borne by one.\nI love my feet better. But, maybe, I shall come yet where I can stand\nand fight.\u2019\n\u2018It may well be so,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden.\nThe king now rose, and at once E\u00b4owyn came forward bearing\nwine. \u2018Ferthu The\u00b4oden ha\u00b4l!\u2019 she said. \u2018Receive now this cup and drink\nin happy hour.

I go forth, and it seems like to be my last riding,\u2019 said\nThe\u00b4oden. \u2018I have no child. The\u00b4odred my son is slain. I name E\u00b4omer\nmy sister-son to be my heir. If neither of us return, then choose a\nnew lord as you will. But to some one I must now entrust my people\nthat I leave behind, to rule them in my place. Which of you will stay?\u2019\nNo man spoke.\n\u2018Is there none whom you would name? In whom do my people\ntrust?\u2019\n\u2018In the House of Eorl,\u2019 answered Ha\u00b4ma.\n\u2018But E\u00b4 omer I cannot spare, nor would he stay,\u2019 said the king; \u2018and\nhe is the last of that House.\u2019\n\u2018I said not E\u00b4omer,\u2019 answered Ha\u00b4ma. \u2018And he is not the last. There\nis E\u00b4owyn, daughter of E\u00b4 omund, his sister. She is fearless and high-\nhearted. All love her. Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we\nare gone.\u2019\n\u2018It shall be so,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Let the heralds announce to the\nfolk that the Lady E\u00b4 owyn will lead them!\u2019\nThen the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and E\u00b4owyn knelt\nbefore him and received from him a sword and a fair corslet. \u2018Farewell\nsister-daughter!\u2019 he said. \u2018Dark is the hour, yet maybe we shall return\nto the Golden Hall. But in Dunharrow the people may long defend\nthemselves, and if the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.\u2019\n\u2018Speak not so!\u2019 she answered. \u2018A year shall I endure for every day\nthat passes until your return.\u2019 But as she spoke her eyes went to\nAragorn who stood nearby.\n\u2018The king shall come again,\u2019 he said. \u2018Fear not! Not West but East\ndoes our doom await us.\u2019\nThe king now went down the stair with Gandalf beside him. The\nothers followed. Aragorn looked back as they passed towards the\ngate. Alone E\u00b4owyn stood before the doors of the house at the stair\u2019s\nhead; the sword was set upright before her, and her hands were laid\nupon the hilt. She was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the\nsun."}
{"548": "restless in my hands. Though I doubt not that these Rohirrim are\nfell-handed when they come to it. Nonetheless this is not the warfare\nthat suits me. How shall I come to the battle? I wish I could walk\nand not bump like a sack at Gandalf \u2019s saddlebow.\u2019\n\u2018A safer seat than many, I guess,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Yet doubtless\nGandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or\nShadowfax himself. An axe is no weapon for a rider.\u2019\n\u2018And a Dwarf is no horseman. It is orc-necks I would hew, not\nshave the scalps of Men,\u2019 said Gimli, patting the haft of his axe.\nAt the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all\nready in the saddle. More than a thousand were there mustered.\nTheir spears were like a springing wood. Loudly and joyously they\nshouted as The\u00b4oden came forth. Some held in readiness the king\u2019s\nhorse, Snowmane, and others held the horses of Aragorn and Legolas.\nGimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but E\u00b4 omer came up to him, leading\nhis horse.\n\u2018Hail, Gimli Glo\u00b4 in\u2019s son!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I have not had time to learn\ngentle speech under your rod, as you promised.

At least I will speak no evil again of the Lady of\nthe Wood.\u2019\n\u2018I will forget my wrath for a while, E\u00b4omer son of E\u00b4 omund,\u2019 said\nGimli; \u2018but if ever you chance to see the Lady Galadriel with your\neyes, then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our\nfriendship will end.\u2019\n\u2018So be it!\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018But until that time pardon me, and in\ntoken of pardon ride with me, I beg. Gandalf will be at the head with\nthe Lord of the Mark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if\nyou will.\u2019\n\u2018I thank you indeed,\u2019 said Gimli greatly pleased. \u2018I will gladly go\nwith you, if Legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.\u2019\n\u2018It shall be so,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018Legolas upon my left, and Aragorn\nupon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!\u2019\n\u2018Where is Shadowfax?\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Running wild over the grass,\u2019 they answered. \u2018He will let no man\nhandle him. There he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow\namong the willows.\u2019\nGandalf whistled and called aloud the horse\u2019s name, and far away\nhe tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host\nlike an arrow.\n\u2018Were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible, even\nso would it appear,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer, as the great horse ran up, until he\nstood before the wizard."}
{"549": "lors, most welcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of\nthe Eorlingas while our kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax,\nprince of horses.\u2019\n\u2018I thank you, The\u00b4oden King,\u2019 said Gandalf. Then suddenly he\nthrew back his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to\nhorseback. He wore no helm nor mail. His snowy hair flew free in\nthe wind, his white robes shone dazzling in the sun.\n\u2018Behold the White Rider!\u2019 cried Aragorn, and all took up the words.\n\u2018Our King and the White Rider!\u2019 they shouted. \u2018Forth Eorlingas!\u2019\nThe trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed. Spear\nclashed on shield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush\nlike the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of Rohan rode\nthundering into the West.\nFar over the plain E\u00b4owyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she\nstood still, alone before the doors of the silent house."}
{"550": "Chapter 7\nHELM\u2019S DEEP\nThe sun was already westering as they rode from Edoras, and the\nlight of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to\na golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the\nfoot-hills of the White Mountains, and this they followed, up and\ndown in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords.\nFar ahead and to their right the Misty Mountains loomed; ever darker\nand taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down\nbefore them. Evening came behind.\nThe host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late,\nthey rode with all the speed they could, pausing seldom. Swift and\nenduring were the steeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to\ngo. Forty leagues and more it was, as a bird flies, from Edoras to the\nfords of the Isen, where they hoped to find the king\u2019s men that held\nback the hosts of Saruman.\nNight closed about them. At last they halted to make their camp.\nThey had ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the\nwestern plain, yet more than half their journey lay still before\nthem. In a great circle, under the starry sky and the waxing moon,\nthey now made their bivouac. They lit no fires, for they were un-\ncertain of events; but they set a ring of mounted guards about\nthem, and scouts rode out far ahead, passing like shadows in the\nfolds of the land. The slow night passed without tidings or alarm.\nAt dawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road\nagain.\nThere were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the\nair; it was hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was hazy,\nand behind it, following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing\ndarkness, as of a great storm moving out of the East. And away in\nthe North-west there seemed to be another darkness brooding about\nthe feet of the Misty Mountains, a shadow that crept down slowly\nfrom the Wizard\u2019s Vale.\nGandalf dropped back to where Legolas rode beside E\u00b4omer. \u2018You\nhave the keen eyes of your fair kindred, Legolas,\u2019 he said; \u2018and they\ncan tell a sparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you see\nanything away yonder towards Isengard?\u2019"}
{"551": "moving in it, great shapes far away upon the bank of the river; but\nwhat they are I cannot tell. It is not mist or cloud that defeats my\neyes: there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land,\nand it marches slowly down stream. It is as if the twilight under\nendless trees were flowing downwards from the hills.\u2019\n\u2018And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It\nwill be a black night.\u2019\nAs the second day of their riding drew on, the heaviness in the air\nincreased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them:\na sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling\nlight. The sun went down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears\nof the Riders were tipped with fire as the last shafts of light kindled\nthe steep faces of the peaks of Thrihyrne: now very near they stood\non the northernmost arm of the White Mountains, three jagged horns\nstaring at the sunset. In the last red glow men in the vanguard saw\na black speck, a horseman riding back towards them. They halted\nawaiting him.\nHe came, a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield. Slowly\nhe climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At length\nhe spoke. \u2018Is E\u00b4 omer here?\u2019 he asked. \u2018You come at last, but too late,\nand with too little strength. Things have gone evilly since The\u00b4odred\nfell. We were driven back yesterday over the Isen with great loss;\nmany perished at the crossing. Then at night fresh forces came over\nthe river against our camp. All Isengard must be emptied; and\nSaruman has armed the wild hillmen and herd-folk of Dunland\nbeyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We were over-\nmastered. The shield-wall was broken. Erkenbrand of Westfold has\ndrawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm\u2019s\nDeep. The rest are scattered.\n\u2018Where is E\u00b4 omer? Tell him there is no hope ahead. He should\nreturn to Edoras before the wolves of Isengard come there.\u2019\nThe\u00b4oden had sat silent, hidden from the man\u2019s sight behind his\nguards; now he urged his horse forward. \u2018Come, stand before me,\nCeorl!\u2019 he said. \u2018I am here. The last host of the Eorlingas has ridden\nforth. It will not return without battle.\u2019\nThe man\u2019s face lightened with joy and wonder. He drew himself\nup. Then he knelt, offering his notched sword to the king. \u2018Command\nme, lord!\u2019 he cried. \u2018And pardon me! I thought\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\u2018You thought I remained in Meduseld bent like an old tree under\nwinter snow. So it was when you rode to war.

Shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand.\u2019 Turning to\nAragorn and E\u00b4omer and the men of the king\u2019s household, he cried:\n\u2018Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till I return. Await me at Helm\u2019s\nGate! Farewell!\u2019\nHe spoke a word to Shadowfax, and like an arrow from the bow\nthe great horse sprang away. Even as they looked he was gone: a\nflash of silver in the sunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled\nand passed from sight. Snowmane snorted and reared, eager to fol-\nlow; but only a swift bird on the wing could have overtaken him.\n\u2018What does that mean?\u2019 said one of the guard to Ha\u00b4ma.\n\u2018That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,\u2019 answered Ha\u00b4ma.\n\u2018Ever he goes and comes unlooked-for.\u2019\n\u2018Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain,\u2019\nsaid the other.\n\u2018True enough,\u2019 said Ha\u00b4ma; \u2018but for myself, I will wait until I see\nGandalf again.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe you will wait long,\u2019 said the other.\nThe host turned away now from the road to the Fords of Isen and\nbent their course southward. Night fell, and still they rode on. The\nhills drew near, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim\nagainst the darkening sky. Still some miles away, on the far side of\nthe Westfold Vale, a great bay in the mountains, lay a green coomb,\nout of which a gorge opened in the hills. Men of that land called it\nHelm\u2019s Deep, after a hero of old wars who had made his refuge there.\nEver steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under\nthe shadow of the Thrihyrne, till the crowhaunted cliffs rose like\nmighty towers on either side, shutting out the light.\nAt Helm\u2019s Gate, before the mouth of the Deep, there was a heel\nof rock thrust outward by the northern cliff. There upon its spur\nstood high walls of ancient stone, and within them was a lofty tower.\nMen said that in the far-off days of the glory of Gondor the sea-kings\nhad built here this fastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg\nit was called, for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed in the\nDeep behind, as if armies long-forgotten were issuing to war from\ncaves beneath the hills.

Thence it fell into the Deeping-coomb and\nout into the Westfold Vale. There in the Hornburg at Helm\u2019s Gate\nErkenbrand, master of Westfold on the borders of the Mark, now\ndwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had\nrepaired the wall and made the fastness strong.\nThe Riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the\nCoomb, when cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that\nwent in front. Out of the darkness arrows whistled. Swiftly a scout\nrode back and reported that wolf-riders were abroad in the valley,\nand that a host of Orcs and wild men were hurrying southward from\nthe Fords of Isen and seemed to be making for Helm\u2019s Deep.\n\u2018We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,\u2019\nsaid the scout. \u2018And we have met scattered companies, going this\nway and that, leaderless. What has become of Erkenbrand none seem\nto know. It is likely that he will be overtaken ere he can reach Helm\u2019s\nGate, if he has not already perished.\u2019\n\u2018Has aught been seen of Gandalf ?\u2019 asked The\u00b4oden.\n\u2018Yes, lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a horse,\npassing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass. Some\nthought he was Saruman. It is said that he went away ere nightfall\ntowards Isengard.

But in this need we have no better choice than to go on,\nas Gandalf said, to Helm\u2019s Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or\nno.

There are caves in Helm\u2019s\nDeep where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up\non to the hills.\u2019\n\u2018Trust not to secret ways,\u2019 said the king. \u2018Saruman has long spied\nout this land.

Now they could hear, borne\nover the dark, the sound of harsh singing. They had climbed far up\ninto the Deeping-coomb when they looked back. Then they saw\ntorches, countless points of fiery light upon the black fields behind,\nscattered like red flowers, or winding up from the lowlands in long\nflickering lines. Here and there a larger blaze leapt up.\n\u2018It is a great host and follows us hard,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018They bring fire,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden, \u2018and they are burning as they\ncome, rick, cot, and tree. This was a rich vale and had many home-\nsteads. Alas for my folk!\u2019\n\u2018Would that day was here and we might ride down upon them\nlike a storm out of the mountains!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018It grieves me to\nfly before them.\u2019\n\u2018We need not fly much further,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018Not far ahead now\nlies Helm\u2019s Dike, an ancient trench and rampart scored across the\ncoomb, two furlongs below Helm\u2019s Gate. There we can turn and\ngive battle.\u2019\n\u2018Nay, we are too few to defend the Dike,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018It is a\nmile long or more, and the breach in it is wide.\u2019\n\u2018At the breach our rearguard must stand, if we are pressed,\u2019 said\nE\u00b4 omer.\nThere was neither star nor moon when the Riders came to the\nbreach in the Dike, where the stream from above passed out, and\nthe road beside it ran down from the Hornburg. The rampart loomed\nsuddenly before them, a high shadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode\nup a sentinel challenged them.\n\u2018The Lord of the Mark rides to Helm\u2019s Gate,\u2019 E\u00b4 omer answered.\n\u2018I, E\u00b4omer son of E\u00b4 omund, speak.\u2019\n\u2018This is good tidings beyond hope,\u2019 said the sentinel. \u2018Hasten! The\nenemy is on your heels.\u2019\nThe host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping\nsward above. They now learned to their joy that Erkenbrand had left\nmany men to hold Helm\u2019s Gate, and more had since escaped thither.\n\u2018Maybe, we have a thousand fit to fight on foot,\u2019 said Gamling,"}

In him lived again the valour of Helm the Hammerhand. But\nwe cannot await him here. We must draw all our forces now behind\nthe walls. Are you well stored? We bring little provision, for we rode\nforth to open battle, not to a siege.\u2019\n\u2018Behind us in the caves of the Deep are three parts of the folk of\nWestfold, old and young, children and women,\u2019 said Gamling. \u2018But\ngreat store of food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been\ngathered there.\u2019\n\u2018That is well,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018They are burning or despoiling all that\nis left in the vale.\u2019\n\u2018If they come to bargain for our goods at Helm\u2019s Gate, they will\npay a high price,\u2019 said Gamling.\nThe king and his Riders passed on. Before the causeway that crossed\nthe stream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up\nthe ramp and passed within the gates of the Hornburg. There they\nwere welcomed again with joy and renewed hope; for now there were\nmen enough to man both the burg and the barrier wall.\nQuickly E\u00b4 omer set his men in readiness. The king and the men\nof his household were in the Hornburg, and there also were many of\nthe Westfold-men. But on the Deeping Wall and its tower, and behind\nit, E\u00b4 omer arrayed most of the strength that he had, for here the\ndefence seemed more doubtful, if the assault were determined and\nin great force. The horses were led far up the Deep under such guard\nas could be spared.\nThe Deeping Wall was twenty feet high, and so thick that four\nmen could walk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet over\nwhich only a tall man could look. Here and there were clefts in the\nstone through which men could shoot. This battlement could be\nreached by a stair running down from a door in the outer court of\nthe Hornburg; three flights of steps led also up on to the wall from\nthe Deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the great stones of\nit were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their\njoints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff.\nGimlistoodleaningagainstthebreastworkuponthewall.Legolas"}

Their\ntorches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines.\nSuddenly from the Dike yells and screams, and the fierce battle-\ncries of men broke out. Flaming brands appeared over the brink and\nclustered thickly at the breach. Then they scattered and vanished.\nMen came galloping back over the field and up the ramp to the gate\nof the Hornburg. The rearguard of the Westfolders had been driven\nin.\n\u2018The enemy is at hand!\u2019 they said. \u2018We loosed every arrow that\nwe had, and filled the Dike with Orcs.

The\nassault on Helm\u2019s Deep had begun, but no sound or challenge was\nheard within; no answering arrows came.\nThe assailing hosts halted, foiled by the silent menace of rock and\nwall. Ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness. Then the\nOrcs screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of\narrows at any that stood revealed upon the battlements; and the men\nof the Mark amazed looked out, as it seemed to them, upon a great\nfield of dark corn, tossed by a tempest of war, and every ear glinted\nwith barbed light.\nBrazen trumpets sounded. The enemy surged forward, some\nagainst the Deeping Wall, others towards the causeway and the ramp\nthat led up to the Hornburg-gates. There the hugest Orcs were\nmustered, and the wild men of the Dunland fells. A moment they\nhesitated and then on they came. The lightning flashed, and blazoned\nupon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of Isengard was seen.\nThey reached the summit of the rock; they drove towards the\ngates.\nThen at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them, and a\nhail of stones. They wavered, broke, and fled back; and then charged\nagain, broke and charged again; and each time, like the incoming\nsea, they halted at a higher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press\nof roaring men leaped forth. They held their great shields above them\nlike a roof, while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighty trees.\nBehind them orc-archers crowded, sending a hail of darts against the\nbowmen on the walls. They gained the gates. The trees, swung by\nstrong arms, smote the timbers with a rending boom. If any man fell,\ncrushed by a stone hurtling from above, two others sprang to take\nhis place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed.\nE\u00b4omer and Aragorn stood together on the Deeping Wall. They\nheard the roar of voices and the thudding of the rams; and then in\na sudden flash of light they beheld the peril of the gates.\n\u2018Come!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018This is the hour when we draw swords\ntogether!\u2019\nRunning like fire, they sped along the wall, and up the steps, and\npassed into the outer court upon the Rock. As they ran they gathered\na handful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that\nopened in an angle of the burg-wall on the west, where the cliff\nstretched out to meet it. On that side a narrow path ran round towards\nthe great gate, between the wall and the sheer brink of the Rock.\nTogether E\u00b4 omer and Aragorn sprang through the door, their men\nclose behind. The two swords flashed from the sheath as one."}
{"558": "Charging from the side, they hurled themselves upon the wild\nmen. Andu\u00b4ril rose and fell, gleaming with white fire. A shout went\nup from wall and tower: \u2018Andu\u00b4ril!

The Blade\nthat was Broken shines again!\u2019\nDismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight; but\nthe wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke, and they\nwere swept away, hewn down, or cast over the Rock into the stony\nstream below. The orc-archers shot wildly and then fled.\nFor a moment E\u00b4 omer and Aragorn halted before the gates. The\nthunder was rumbling in the distance now. The lightning flickered\nstill, far off among the mountains in the South. A keen wind was\nblowing from the North again. The clouds were torn and drifting,\nand stars peeped out; and above the hills of the Coomb-side the\nwestering moon rode, glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack.\n\u2018We did not come too soon,\u2019 said Aragorn, looking at the gates.\nTheir great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of\ntheir timbers were cracked. \u2018The doors will not withstand another\nsuch battering.\u2019\n\u2018Yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them,\u2019 said\nE\u00b4 omer. \u2018Look!\u2019 He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press\nof Orcs and Men were gathering again beyond the stream. Arrows\nwhined, and skipped on the stones about them. \u2018Come! We must get\nback and see what we can do to pile stone and beam across the gates\nwithin. Come now!\u2019\nThey turned and ran. At that moment some dozen Orcs that had\nlain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently\nand swiftly behind. Two flung themselves to the ground at E\u00b4 omer\u2019s\nheels, tripped him, and in a moment they were on top of him. But\na small dark figure that none had observed sprang out of the shadows\nand gave a hoarse shout: Baruk Khaza\u02c6d! Khaza\u02c6d ai-me\u02c6nu! An axe\nswung and swept back. Two Orcs fell headless. The rest fled.\nE\u00b4omer struggled to his feet, even as Aragorn ran back to his aid.\nThe postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled\ninside with stones. When all were safe within, E\u00b4omer turned: \u2018I thank\nyou, Gimli son of Glo\u00b4in!\u2019 he said. \u2018I did not know that you were with\nus in the sortie. But oft the unbidden guest proves the best company.\nHow came you there?\u2019\n\u2018I followed you to shake off sleep,\u2019 said Gimli; \u2018but I looked on\nthe hillmen and they seemed over large for me, so I sat beside a stone\nto see your sword-play.\u2019"}

Yet I make my tale twenty at\nthe least. But that is only a few leaves in a forest.\u2019\nThe sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shin-\ning brightly. But the light brought little hope to the Riders of the\nMark. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than\ndiminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through\nthe breach. The sortie upon the Rock gained only a brief respite.\nThe assault on the gates was redoubled. Against the Deeping Wall\nthe hosts of Isengard roared like a sea. Orcs and hillmen swarmed\nabout its feet from end to end. Ropes with grappling hooks were\nhurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them\nback. Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down\nin ruin, but many more replaced them, and Orcs sprang up them\nlike apes in the dark forests of the South. Before the wall\u2019s foot the\ndead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose\nthe hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on.\nThe men of Rohan grew weary. All their arrows were spent, and\nevery shaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields\nwere riven. Three times Aragorn and E\u00b4omer rallied them, and three\ntimes Andu\u00b4ril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy\nfrom the wall.\nThen a clamour arose in the Deep behind. Orcs had crept like\nrats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. There\nthey had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above\nwas hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the\nwall\u2019s top. Then they sprang out. Already some had passed into the\njaws of the Deep and were among the horses, fighting with the guards.\nDown from the wall leapt Gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in\nthe cliffs. \u2018Khaza\u02c6d! Khaza\u02c6d!\u2019 He soon had work enough.\n\u2018Ai-oi!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018The Orcs are behind the wall. Ai-oi! Come,\nLegolas! There are enough for us both. Khaza\u02c6d ai-me\u02c6nu!\u2019\nGamling the Old looked down from the Hornburg, hearing the\ngreat voice of the dwarf above all the tumult. \u2018The Orcs are in the Deep!\u2019\nhe cried. \u2018Helm! Helm! Forth Helmingas!\u2019 he shouted as he leaped"}
{"560": "them. Ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge,\nand all were slain or driven shrieking into the chasm of the Deep to\nfall before the guardians of the hidden caves.\n\u2018Twenty-one!\u2019 cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and\nlaid the last Orc before his feet. \u2018Now my count passes Master Legolas\nagain.\u2019\n\u2018We must stop this rat-hole,\u2019 said Gamling. \u2018Dwarves are said to\nbe cunning folk with stone. Lend us your aid, master!\u2019\n\u2018We do not shape stone with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,\u2019\nsaid Gimli. \u2018But I will help as I may.\u2019\nThey gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they\ncould find to hand, and under Gimli\u2019s direction the Westfold-men\nblocked up the inner end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet\nremained. Then the Deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned\nand fretted in its choked path, and spread slowly in cold pools from\ncliff to cliff.\n\u2018It will be drier above,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Come, Gamling, let us see\nhow things go on the wall!\u2019\nHe climbed up and found Legolas beside Aragorn and E\u00b4 omer.\nThe elf was whetting his long knife. There was for a while a lull in\nthe assault, since the attempt to break in through the culvert had\nbeen foiled.\n\u2018Twenty-one!\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018Good!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018But my count is now two dozen. It has been\nknife-work up here.\u2019\nE\u00b4omer and Aragorn leant wearily on their swords. Away on the\nleft the crash and clamour of the battle on the Rock rose loud again.\nBut the Hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea. Its gates\nlay in ruin; but over the barricade of beams and stones within no\nenemy as yet had passed.\nAragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping\nbehind the western hills that enclosed the valley. \u2018This is a night as\nlong as years,\u2019 he said. \u2018How long will the day tarry?\u2019\n\u2018Dawn is not far off,\u2019 said Gamling, who had now climbed up\nbeside him. \u2018But dawn will not help us, I fear.\u2019\n\u2018Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018But these creatures of Isengard, these half-orcs and goblin-men\nthat the foul craft of Saruman has bred, they will not quail at the\nsun,\u2019 said Gamling. \u2018And neither will the wild men of the hills.

Death to the Forgoil!\nDeath to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers of the North!\u2019\u2019 Such\nnames they have for us.

Then there\nwas a crash and a flash of flame and smoke. The waters of the\nDeeping-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked\nno longer, a gaping hole was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes\npoured in.\n\u2018Devilry of Saruman!\u2019 cried Aragorn. \u2018They have crept in the cul-\nvert again, while we talked, and they have lit the fire of Orthanc\nbeneath our feet. Elendil, Elendil!\u2019 he shouted, as he leaped down into\nthe breach; but even as he did so a hundred ladders were raised\nagainst the battlements. Over the wall and under the wall the last\nassault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand. The\ndefence was swept away. Some of the Riders were driven back, further\nand further into the Deep, falling and fighting as they gave way, step\nby step, towards the caves. Others cut their way back towards the\ncitadel.\nA broad stairway climbed from the Deep up to the Rock and the\nrear-gate of the Hornburg. Near the bottom stood Aragorn. In his\nhand still Andu\u00b4ril gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while\nheld back the enemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair\npassed up towards the gate. Behind on the upper steps knelt Legolas.\nHis bow was bent, but one gleaned arrow was all that he had left,\nand he peered out now, ready to shoot the first Orc that should dare\nto approach the stair.\n\u2018All who can have now got safe within, Aragorn,\u2019 he called. \u2018Come\nback!\u2019\nAragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled"}

His\ncounsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun.\u2019\n\u2018Do not judge the counsel of Gandalf, until all is over, lord,\u2019 said\nAragorn.\n\u2018The end will not be long,\u2019 said the king. \u2018But I will not end here,\ntaken like an old badger in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel and the\nhorses of my guard are in the inner court. When dawn comes, I will\nbid men sound Helm\u2019s horn, and I will ride forth. Will you ride with\nme then, son of Arathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make\nsuch an end as will be worth a song \u2013 if any be left to sing of us\nhereafter.\u2019\n\u2018I will ride with you,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nTaking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all\ntheir circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the\nassault was hot. Legolas went with him. Blasts of fire leaped up from\nbelow shaking the stones. Grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders\nraised. Again and again the Orcs gained the summit of the outer wall,\nand again the defenders cast them down.\nAt last Aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts\nof the enemy. As he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale.\nThen he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.\nThe Orcs yelled and jeered. \u2018Come down! Come down!\u2019 they cried.\n\u2018If you wish to speak to us, come down! Bring out your king! We are\nthe fighting Uruk-hai. We will fetch him from his hole, if he does\nnot come. Bring out your skulking king!\u2019\n\u2018The king stays or comes at his own will,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Thenwhatareyoudoinghere?\u2019theyanswered.\u2018Whydoyoulook"}
{"564": "\u2018I looked out to see the dawn,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018What of the dawn?\u2019 they jeered. \u2018We are the Uruk-hai: we do not\nstop the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. We come\nto kill, by sun or moon. What of the dawn?\u2019\n\u2018None knows what the new day shall bring him,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Get you gone, ere it turn to your evil.\u2019\n\u2018Get down or we will shoot you from the wall,\u2019 they cried. \u2018This\nis no parley. You have nothing to say.\u2019\n\u2018I have still this to say,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018No enemy has yet\ntaken the Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not\none will be left alive to take back tidings to the North. You do not\nknow your peril.\u2019\nSo great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood\nthere alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that\nmany of the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to\nthe valley, and some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs\nlaughed with loud voices; and a hail of darts and arrows whistled\nover the wall, as Aragorn leaped down.\nThere was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above\nwhich he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke\nand dust. The barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. Aragorn\nran to the king\u2019s tower.\nBut even as the gate fell, and the Orcs about it yelled, preparing\nto charge, a murmur arose behind them, like a wind in the distance,\nand it grew to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the\ndawn. The Orcs upon the Rock, hearing the rumour of dismay,\nwavered and looked back. And then, sudden and terrible, from the\ntower above, the sound of the great horn of Helm rang out.\nAll that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Orcs cast them-\nselves on their faces and covered their ears with their claws. Back\nfrom the Deep the echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff\nand hill a mighty herald stood. But on the walls men looked up,\nlistening with wonder; for the echoes did not die. Ever the hornblasts\nwound on among the hills; nearer now and louder they answered\none to another, blowing fierce and free.\n\u2018Helm! Helm!\u2019 the Riders shouted. \u2018Helm is arisen and comes\nback to war. Helm for The\u00b4oden King!\u2019\nAnd with that shout the king came. His horse was white as snow,\ngolden was his shield, and his spear was long. At his right hand was\nAragorn, Elendil\u2019s heir, behind him rode the lords of the House of\nEorl the Young. Light sprang in the sky. Night departed."}

Out poured all the men that were left\nupon the Rock. And ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the\nhills.\nOn they rode, the king and his companions. Captains and cham-\npions fell or fled before them. Neither orc nor man withstood them.\nTheir backs were to the swords and spears of the Riders, and their\nfaces to the valley. They cried and wailed, for fear and great wonder\nhad come upon them with the rising of the day.\nSo King The\u00b4oden rode from Helm\u2019s Gate and clove his path to\nthe great Dike. There the company halted. Light grew bright about\nthem. Shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered\non their spears. But they sat silent on their horses, and they gazed\ndown upon the Deeping-coomb.\nThe land had changed. Where before the green dale had lain, its\ngrassy slopes lapping the ever-mounting hills, there now a forest\nloomed. Great trees, bare and silent, stood, rank on rank, with tangled\nbough and hoary head; their twisted roots were buried in the long\ngreen grass. Darkness was under them. Between the Dike and the\neaves of that nameless wood only two open furlongs lay. There now\ncowered the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror of the king and in\nterror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm\u2019s Gate until all\nabove the Dike was empty of them, but below it they were packed\nlike swarming flies. Vainly they crawled and clambered about the\nwalls of the coomb, seeking to escape. Upon the east too sheer and\nstony was the valley\u2019s side; upon the left, from the west, their final\ndoom approached.\nThere suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white,\nshining in the rising sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding.\nBehind him, hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men\non foot; their swords were in their hands. Amid them strode a man\ntall and strong. His shield was red. As he came to the valley\u2019s brink,\nhe set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast.\n\u2018Erkenbrand!\u2019 the Riders shouted. \u2018Erkenbrand!\u2019\n\u2018Behold the White Rider!\u2019 cried Aragorn. \u2018Gandalf is come again!\u2019\n\u2018Mithrandir, Mithrandir!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018This is wizardry indeed!\nCome! I would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.\u2019\nThe hosts of Isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning\nfrom fear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down"}

The wild men fell on their faces before him.\nThe Orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear.\nLike a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing\nthey passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that\nshadow none ever came again."}
{"567": "Chapter 8\nTHE ROAD TO ISENGARD\nSo it was that in the light of a fair morning King The\u00b4oden and\nGandalf the White Rider met again upon the green grass beside the\nDeeping-stream. There was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and\nLegolas the Elf, and Erkenbrand of Westfold, and the lords of the\nGolden House. About them were gathered the Rohirrim, the Riders\nof the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes\nwere turned towards the wood.\nSuddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came\nthose who had been driven back into the Deep. There came Gamling\nthe Old, and E\u00b4omer son of E\u00b4 omund, and beside them walked Gimli\nthe dwarf. He had no helm, and about his head was a linen band\nstained with blood; but his voice was loud and strong.\n\u2018Forty-two, Master Legolas!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Alas! My axe is notched:\nthe forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?\u2019\n\u2018You have passed my score by one,\u2019 answered Legolas. \u2018But I do\nnot grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!\u2019\n\u2018Welcome, E\u00b4omer, sister-son!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Now that I see you\nsafe, I am glad indeed.\u2019\n\u2018Hail, Lord of the Mark!\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018The dark night has passed,\nand day has come again. But the day has brought strange tidings.\u2019\nHe turned and gazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at Gandalf.\n\u2018Once more you come in the hour of need, unlooked-for,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Unlooked-for?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I said that I would return and meet\nyou here.\u2019\n\u2018But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your\ncoming. Strange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf\nthe White!\u2019\n\u2018That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given\ngood counsel in peril, and made use of the speed of Shadowfax. Your\nown valour has done more, and the stout legs of the Westfold-men\nmarching through the night.\u2019\nThen they all gazed at Gandalf with still greater wonder. Some\nglanced darkly at the wood, and passed their hands over their brows,\nas if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his.\nGandalf laughed long and merrily. \u2018The trees?\u2019 he said. \u2018Nay, I\nsee the wood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is"}
{"568": "\u2018Then if not yours, whose is the wizardry?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Not\nSaruman\u2019s, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of whom we\nhave yet to learn?\u2019\n\u2018It is not wizardry, but a power far older,\u2019 said Gandalf: \u2018a power\nthat walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang.\nEre iron was found or tree was hewn,\nWhen young was mountain under moon;\nEre ring was made, or wrought was woe,\nIt walked the forests long ago.\u2019\n\u2018And what may be the answer to your riddle?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden.\n\u2018If you would learn that, you should come with me to Isengard,\u2019\nanswered Gandalf.\n\u2018To Isengard?\u2019 they cried.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I shall return to Isengard, and those who will\nmay come with me. There we may see strange things.\u2019\n\u2018But there are not men enough in the Mark, not if they were all\ngathered together and healed of wounds and weariness, to assault\nthe stronghold of Saruman,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden.\n\u2018Nevertheless to Isengard I go,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I shall not stay there\nlong. My way lies now eastward. Look for me in Edoras, ere the\nwaning of the moon!\u2019\n\u2018Nay!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018In the dark hour before dawn I doubted,\nbut we will not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.\u2019\n\u2018I wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be now,\u2019 said\nGandalf, \u2018and since he has done you great injury, it would be fitting\nif you were there. But how soon and how swiftly will you ride?\u2019\n\u2018My men are weary with battle,\u2019 said the King; \u2018and I am weary\nalso. For I have ridden far and slept little. Alas! My old age is not\nfeigned nor due only to the whisperings of Wormtongue. It is an ill\nthat no leech can wholly cure, not even Gandalf.\u2019\n\u2018Then let all who are to ride with me rest now,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We\nwill journey under the shadow of evening. It is as well; for it is my\ncounsel that all our comings and goings should be as secret as may\nbe, henceforth. But do not command many men to go with you,\nThe\u00b4oden. We go to a parley not to a fight.\u2019\nThe King then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses,\nand he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of\nthe Mark; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young\nand old, to come in haste to Edoras. There the Lord of the Mark\nwouldholdan assemblyofallthatcouldbear arms,onthethirdday"}

In spite of his hurt the dwarf would\nnot stay behind.\n\u2018It was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it,\u2019 he said. \u2018It would\ntake more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.\u2019\n\u2018I will tend it, while you rest,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nThe king now returned to the Hornburg, and slept, such a sleep\nof quiet as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of\nhis chosen company rested also. But the others, all that were not\nhurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fallen in the\nbattle and lay dead upon the field or in the Deep.\nNo Orcs remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But a great\nmany of the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid,\nand cried for mercy.\nThe Men of the Mark took their weapons from them, and set\nthem to work.\n\u2018Help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,\u2019 said Erken-\nbrand; \u2018and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the\nFords of Isen in arms, nor to march with the enemies of Men; and\nthen you shall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded\nby Saruman. Many of you have got death as the reward of your trust\nin him; but had you conquered, little better would your wages have\nbeen.\u2019\nThe men of Dunland were amazed; for Saruman had told them\nthat the men of Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive.\nIn the midst of the field before the Hornburg two mounds were\nraised, and beneath them were laid all the Riders of the Mark who\nfell in the defence, those of the East Dales upon one side, and those\nof Westfold upon the other. But the men of Dunland were set apart\nin a mound below the Dike. In a grave alone under the shadow of\nthe Hornburg lay Ha\u00b4ma, captain of the King\u2019s guard. He fell before\nthe Gate.\nThe Orcs were piled in great heaps, away from the mounds of\nMen, not far from the eaves of the forest. And the people were\ntroubled in their minds; for the heaps of carrion were too great for\nburial or for burning. They had little wood for firing, and none would\nhave dared to take an axe to the strange trees, even if Gandalf had\nnot warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great peril.\n\u2018Let the Orcs lie,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The morning may bring new\ncounsel.\u2019\nIn the afternoon the King\u2019s company prepared to depart.

Behind them were gathered a great host,\nboth of the Riders and of the people of Westfold, old and young,\nwomen and children, who had come out from the caves. A song of\nvictory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell silent, wondering\nwhat would chance, for their eyes were on the trees and they feared\nthem.\nThe Riders came to the wood, and they halted; horse and man,\nthey were unwilling to pass in. The trees were grey and menacing,\nand a shadow or a mist was about them. The ends of their long\nsweeping boughs hung down like searching fingers, their roots stood\nup from the ground like the limbs of strange monsters, and dark\ncaverns opened beneath them. But Gandalf went forward, leading\nthe company, and where the road from the Hornburg met the trees\nthey saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs;\nand through it Gandalf passed, and they followed him. Then to their\namazement they found that the road ran on, and the Deeping-stream\nbeside it; and the sky was open above and full of golden light. But\non either side the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in\ndusk, stretching away into impenetrable shadows; and there they\nheard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far cries, and a\nrumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. No Orc or other living\ncreature could be seen.\nLegolas and Gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and\nthey kept close beside Gandalf, for Gimli was afraid of the wood.\n\u2018It is hot in here,\u2019 said Legolas to Gandalf. \u2018I feel a great wrath\nabout me. Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018What has become of the miserable Orcs?\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018That, I think, no one will ever know,\u2019 said Gandalf.\nThey rode in silence for a while; but Legolas was ever glancing\nfrom side to side, and would often have halted to listen to the sounds\nof the wood, if Gimli had allowed it.\n\u2018These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,\u2019 he said; \u2018and I have\nseen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. I wish that there\nwere leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time\nI might come to understand their thought.\u2019\n\u2018No, no!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Let us leave them! I guess their thought"}
{"571": "\u2018Not of all that go on two legs,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018There I think you\nare wrong. It is Orcs that they hate. For they do not belong here and\nknow little of Elves and Men. Far away are the valleys where they\nsprang. From the deep dales of Fangorn, Gimli, that is whence they\ncome, I guess.\u2019\n\u2018Then that is the most perilous wood in Middle-earth,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018I should be grateful for the part they have played, but I do not love\nthem. You may think them wonderful, but I have seen a greater\nwonder in this land, more beautiful than any grove or glade that ever\ngrew: my heart is still full of it.\n\u2018Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas! Here they have one of the\nmarvels of the Northern World, and what do they say of it? Caves,\nthey say! Caves! Holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in!\nMy good Legolas, do you know that the caverns of Helm\u2019s Deep are\nvast and beautiful? There would be an endless pilgrimage of Dwarves,\nmerely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. Aye indeed,\nthey would pay pure gold for a brief glance!\u2019\n\u2018And I would give gold to be excused,\u2019 said Legolas; \u2018and double\nto be let out, if I strayed in!\u2019\n\u2018You have not seen, so I forgive your jest,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But you\nspeak like a fool. Do you think those halls are fair, where your King\ndwells under the hill in Mirkwood, and Dwarves helped in their\nmaking long ago? They are but hovels compared with the caverns I\nhave seen here: immeasurable halls, filled with an everlasting music of\nwater that tinkles into pools, as fair as Kheled-za\u02c6ram in the starlight.\n\u2018And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the\nsandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and\ncrystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the\nlight glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living\nhands of Queen Galadriel. There are columns of white and saffron\nand dawn-rose, Legolas, fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms;\nthey spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening\npendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine as frozen clouds;\nspears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes mirror\nthem: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear\nglass; cities, such as the mind of Durin could scarce have imagined in\nhis sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the\ndark recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop falls,\nand the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and\nwaver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening\ncomes: they fade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another\nchamber and another dream. There is chamber after chamber,"}

But do not tell all your kindred! There seems little left for\nthem to do, from your account. Maybe the men of this land are wise\nto say little: one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel\nmight mar more than they made.\u2019\n\u2018No, you do not understand,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018No dwarf could be\nunmoved by such loveliness. None of Durin\u2019s race would mine those\ncaves for stones or ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there.\nDo you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the springtime for\nfirewood? We would tend these glades of flowering stone, not quarry\nthem. With cautious skill, tap by tap \u2013 a small chip of rock and no\nmore, perhaps, in a whole anxious day \u2013 so we could work, and as\nthe years went by, we should open up new ways, and display far\nchambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures\nin the rock. And lights, Legolas! We should make lights, such lamps\nas once shone in Khazad-du\u02c6m; and when we wished we would drive\naway the night that has lain there since the hills were made; and\nwhen we desired rest, we would let the night return.\u2019\n\u2018You move me, Gimli,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I have never heard you speak\nlike this before. Almost you make me regret that I have not seen\nthese caves. Come!

As they rode from under the eaves of the wood,\nLegolas halted and looked back with regret. Then he gave a sudden cry.\n\u2018There are eyes!\u2019 he said. \u2018Eyes looking out from the shadows of\nthe boughs! I never saw such eyes before.\u2019\nThe others, surprised by his cry, halted and turned; but Legolas\nstarted to ride back.\n\u2018No, no!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018Do as you please in your madness, but let\nme first get down from this horse! I wish to see no eyes!\u2019\n\u2018Stay, Legolas Greenleaf !\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Do not go back into the\nwood, not yet! Now is not your time.\u2019\nEven as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees three strange\nshapes. As tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; their\nstrong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment\nor with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long,\nand their hands had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards\ngrey-green as moss. They gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were\nnot looking at the riders: their eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly\nthey lifted their long hands to their mouths, and sent forth ringing\ncalls, clear as notes of a horn, but more musical and various. The\ncalls were answered; and turning again, the riders saw other creatures\nof the same kind approaching, striding through the grass. They came\nswiftly from the North, walking like wading herons in their gait, but\nnot in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than\nthe heron\u2019s wings. The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some set\ntheir hands upon their sword-hilts.\n\u2018You need no weapons,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018These are but herdsmen.\nThey are not enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.\u2019\nSo it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a\nglance at the riders, strode into the wood and vanished.\n\u2018Herdsmen!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Where are their flocks? What are they,\nGandalf ? For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.\u2019\n\u2018They are the shepherds of the trees,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018Is it so\nlong since you listened to tales by the fireside? There are children in\nyour land who, out of the twisted threads of story, could pick the\nanswer to your question. You have seen Ents, O King, Ents out of\nFangorn Forest, which in your tongue you call the Entwood. Did\nyou think that the name was given only in idle fancy?

Long we have tended our\nbeasts and our fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or ridden\naway to help in the wars of Minas Tirith. And that we called the life\nof Men, the way of the world. We cared little for what lay beyond\nthe borders of our land. Songs we have that tell of these things, but\nwe are forgetting them, teaching them only to children, as a careless\ncustom. And now the songs have come down among us out of strange\nplaces, and walk visible under the Sun.\u2019\n\u2018You should be glad, The\u00b4oden King,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018For not only\nthe little life of Men is now endangered, but the life also of those\nthings which you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not\nwithout allies, even if you know them not.\u2019\n\u2018Yet also I should be sad,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018For however the fortune\nof war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and\nwonderful shall pass for ever out of Middle-earth?\u2019\n\u2018It may,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured,\nnor made as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed.\nLet us now go on with the journey we have begun!\u2019\nThe company turned then away from the Coomb and from the\nwood and took the road towards the Fords. Legolas followed reluc-\ntantly. The sun had set, already it had sunk behind the rim of the\nworld; but as they rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked\nwest to the Gap of Rohan the sky was still red, and a burning light\nwas under the floating clouds. Dark against it there wheeled and flew\nmany black-winged birds. Some passed overhead with mournful cries,\nreturning to their homes among the rocks.\n\u2018The carrion-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,\u2019 said\nE\u00b4omer.\nThey rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the\nplains about them. The slow moon mounted, now waxing towards\nthe full, and in its cold silver light the swelling grass-lands rose and\nfell like a wide grey sea. They had ridden for some four hours from\nthe branching of the roads when they drew near to the Fords. Long\nslopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread in stony shoals\nbetween high grassy terraces. Borne upon the wind they heard the\nhowling of wolves. Their hearts were heavy, remembering the many\nmen that had fallen in battle in this place.\nThe road dipped between rising turf-banks, carving its way\nthrough the terraces to the river\u2019s edge, and up again upon the further\nside.Therewerethreelinesofflatstepping-stonesacrossthestream,"}
{"575": "and it seemed strange to them; for the Fords had ever been a place\nfull of the rush and chatter of water upon stones; but now they were\nsilent. The beds of the stream were almost dry, a bare waste of\nshingles and grey sand.\n\u2018This is become a dreary place,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018What sickness has\nbefallen the river? Many fair things Saruman has destroyed: has he\ndevoured the springs of Isen too?\u2019\n\u2018So it would seem,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Alas!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Must we pass this way, where the carrion-\nbeasts devour so many good Riders of the Mark?\u2019\n\u2018This is our way,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Grievous is the fall of your men;\nbut you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not\ndevour them. It is with their friends, the Orcs, that they hold their\nfeast: such indeed is the friendship of their kind. Come!\u2019\nThey rode down to the river, and as they came the wolves ceased\ntheir howling and slunk away. Fear fell on them seeing Gandalf in\nthe moon, and Shadowfax his horse shining like silver. The riders\npassed over to the islet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from\nthe shadows of the banks.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Friends have laboured here.\u2019\nAnd they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled,\nringed with stones, and set about with many spears.\n\u2018Here lie all the Men of the Mark that fell near this place,\u2019 said\nGandalf.\n\u2018Here let them rest!\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018And when their spears have\nrotted and rusted, long still may their mound stand and guard the\nFords of Isen!\u2019\n\u2018Is this your work also, Gandalf, my friend?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018You\naccomplished much in an evening and a night!\u2019\n\u2018With the help of Shadowfax \u2013 and others,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I rode\nfast and far. But here beside the mound I will say this for your\ncomfort: many fell in the battles of the Fords, but fewer than rumour\nmade them. More were scattered than were slain; I gathered together\nall that I could find. Some men I sent with Grimbold of Westfold to\njoin Erkenbrand. Some I set to make this burial. They have now\nfollowed your marshal, Elfhelm. I sent him with many Riders to\nEdoras. Saruman I knew had despatched his full strength against\nyou, and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and\ngone to Helm\u2019s Deep: the lands seemed empty of enemies; yet I\nfeared that wolf-riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless to\nMeduseld, while it was undefended. But now I think you need not\nfear: you will find your house to welcome your return.\u2019"}
{"576": "With that the company said farewell to the island and the mound,\nand passed over the river, and climbed the further bank. Then they\nrode on, glad to have left the mournful Fords. As they went the\nhowling of the wolves broke out anew.\nThere was an ancient highway that ran down from Isengard to the\ncrossings. For some way it took its course beside the river, bending\nwith it east and then north; but at the last it turned away and went\nstraight towards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the\nmountain-side in the west of the valley, sixteen miles or more from\nits mouth. This road they followed but they did not ride upon it; for\nthe ground beside it was firm and level, covered for many miles\nabout with short springing turf. They rode now more swiftly, and by\nmidnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind. Then they halted,\nending their night\u2019s journey, for the King was weary. They were come\nto the feet of the Misty Mountains, and the long arms of Nan Curun\u00b4\u0131r\nstretched down to meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the\nmoon had passed into the West, and its light was hidden by the hills.\nBut out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and\nvapour; as it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and\nspread in shimmering billows, black and silver, over the starry sky.\n\u2018What do you think of that, Gandalf ?\u2019 asked Aragorn. \u2018One would\nsay that all the Wizard\u2019s Vale was burning.\u2019\n\u2018There is ever a fume above that valley in these days,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer:\n\u2018but I have never seen aught like this before. These are steams rather\nthan smokes. Saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. Maybe he\nis boiling all the waters of Isen, and that is why the river runs dry.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe he is,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Tomorrow we shall learn what he is\ndoing. Now let us rest for a while, if we can.\u2019\nThey camped beside the bed of the Isen river; it was still silent\nand empty. Some of them slept a little. But late in the night the\nwatchmen cried out, and all awoke. The moon was gone. Stars were\nshining above; but over the ground there crept a darkness blacker\nthan the night. On both sides of the river it rolled towards them,\ngoing northward.\n\u2018Stay where you are!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Draw no weapons! Wait! and\nit will pass you by!\u2019\nA mist gathered about them. Above them a few stars still glim-\nmered faintly; but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable\ngloom; they were in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow.\nVoices they heard, whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling\nsigh; the earth shook under them. Long it seemed to them that they\nsat and were afraid; but at last the darkness and the rumour passed,"}
{"577": "Away south upon the Hornburg, in the middle night men heard\na great noise, as a wind in the valley, and the ground trembled; and\nall were afraid and no one ventured to go forth. But in the morning\nthey went out and were amazed; for the slain Orcs were gone, and\nthe trees also. Far down into the valley of the Deep the grass was\ncrushed and trampled brown, as if giant herdsmen had pastured great\ndroves of cattle there; but a mile below the Dike a huge pit had been\ndelved in the earth, and over it stones were piled into a hill. Men\nbelieved that the Orcs whom they had slain were buried there; but\nwhether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none\ncould say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. The Death Down\nit was afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the\nstrange trees were never seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had\nreturned at night, and had gone far away to the dark dales of Fangorn.\nThus they were revenged upon the Orcs.\nThe king and his company slept no more that night; but they saw\nand heard no other strange thing, save one: the voice of the river\nbeside them suddenly awoke. There was a rush of water hurrying\ndown among the stones; and when it had passed, the Isen flowed\nand bubbled in its bed again, as it had ever done.\nAt dawn they made ready to go on. The light came grey and pale,\nand they did not see the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy\nwith fog, and a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly,\nriding now upon the highway. It was broad and hard, and well-\ntended. Dimly through the mists they could descry the long arm of\nthe mountains rising on their left. They had passed into Nan Curun\u00b4\u0131r,\nthe Wizard\u2019s Vale. That was a sheltered valley, open only to the\nSouth. Once it had been fair and green, and through it the Isen\nflowed, already deep and strong before it found the plains; for it was\nfed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills,\nand all about it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land.\nIt was not so now. Beneath the walls of Isengard there still were\nacres tilled by the slaves of Saruman; but most of the valley had\nbecome a wilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the\nground, or clambering over bush and bank, made shaggy caves where\nsmall beasts housed. No trees grew there; but among the rank grasses\ncould still be seen the burned and axe-hewn stumps of ancient groves.\nIt was a sad country, silent now but for the stony noise of quick\nwaters. Smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the\nhollows. The riders did not speak. Many doubted in their hearts,\nwondering to what dismal end their journey led."}
{"578": "blade of grass was seen in any joint. Deep gutters, filled with trickling\nwater, ran down on either side. Suddenly a tall pillar loomed up\nbefore them. It was black; and set upon it was a great stone, carved\nand painted in the likeness of a long White Hand. Its finger pointed\nnorth. Not far now they knew that the gates of Isengard must stand,\nand their hearts were heavy; but their eyes could not pierce the mists\nahead.\nBeneath the mountain\u2019s arm within the Wizard\u2019s Vale through\nyears uncounted had stood that ancient place that Men called Isen-\ngard. Partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains, but mighty\nworks the Men of Westernesse had wrought there of old; and\nSaruman had dwelt there long and had not been idle.\nThis was its fashion, while Saruman was at his height, accounted\nby many the chief of Wizards. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering\ncliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which\nit ran and then returned again. One entrance only was there made\nin it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black\nrock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty\ndoors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge\nhinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred\nthey could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One\nwho passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld\na plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl:\na mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams\nthat flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew\nthere in the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with\nstone-flags, dark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees\nthere marched long lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper\nand of iron, joined by heavy chains.\nMany houses there were, chambers, halls, and passages, cut and\ntunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side, so that all the\nopen circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors.\nThousands could dwell there, workers, servants, slaves, and warriors\nwith great store of arms; wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens\nbeneath. The plain, too, was bored and delved. Shafts were driven\ndeep into the ground; their upper ends were covered by low mounds\nand domes of stone, so that in the moonlight the Ring of Isengard\nlooked like a graveyard of unquiet dead. For the ground trembled.\nThe shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns\nfar under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries,"}
{"579": "vents, lit from beneath with red light, or blue, or venomous green.\nTo the centre all the roads ran between their chains. There stood\na tower of marvellous shape. It was fashioned by the builders of old,\nwho smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a thing not\nmade by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in\nthe ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it was,\nblack and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were\nwelded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns,\ntheir pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives.\nBetween them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished\nstone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred\nfeet above the plain. This was Orthanc, the citadel of Saruman, the\nname of which had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning; for in\nthe Elvish speech orthanc signifies Mount Fang, but in the language\nof the Mark of old the Cunning Mind.\nA strong place and wonderful was Isengard, and long it had been\nbeautiful; and there great lords had dwelt, the wardens of Gondor\nupon the West, and wise men that watched the stars. But Saruman\nhad slowly shaped it to his shifting purposes, and made it better, as\nhe thought, being deceived \u2013 for all those arts and subtle devices, for\nwhich he forsook his former wisdom, and which fondly he imagined\nwere his own, came but from Mordor; so that what he made was\nnaught, only a little copy, a child\u2019s model or a slave\u2019s flattery, of that\nvast fortress, armoury, prison, furnace of great power, Barad-du\u02c6r, the\nDark Tower, which suffered no rival, and laughed at flattery, biding\nits time, secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength.\nThis was the stronghold of Saruman, as fame reported it; for\nwithin living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates,\nsave perhaps a few, such as Wormtongue, who came in secret and\ntold no man what they saw.\nNow Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it;\nand as he did so the Riders saw to their wonder that the Hand\nappeared no longer white. It was stained as with dried blood; and\nlooking closer they perceived that its nails were red. Unheeding Gan-\ndalf rode on into the mist, and reluctantly they followed him. All\nabout them now, as if there had been a sudden flood, wide pools of\nwater lay beside the road, filling the hollows, and rills went trickling\ndown among the stones.\nAt last Gandalf halted and beckoned to them; and they came, and\nsaw that beyond him the mists had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone.\nThe hour of noon had passed. They were come to the doors of"}
{"580": "stone, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, was scat-\ntered far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch still\nstood, but it opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid\nbare, and through the cliff-like walls on either side great rents and\nbreaches had been torn; their towers were beaten into dust. If the\nGreat Sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm, it\ncould have worked no greater ruin.\nThe ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling caul-\ndron, in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and\nspars, chests and casks and broken gear. Twisted and leaning pillars\nreared their splintered stems above the flood, but all the roads were\ndrowned. Far off, it seemed, half veiled in winding cloud, there\nloomed the island rock. Still dark and tall, unbroken by the storm,\nthe tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped about its feet.\nThe king and all his company sat silent on their horses, marvelling,\nperceiving that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they\ncould not guess. And now they turned their eyes towards the archway\nand the ruined gates. There they saw close beside them a great rubble-\nheap; and suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on it\nat their ease, grey-clad, hardly to be seen among the stones. There\nwere bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them, as if they had\njust eaten well, and now rested from their labour. One seemed asleep;\nthe other, with crossed legs and arms behind his head, leaned back\nagainst a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little\nrings of thin blue smoke.\nFor a moment The\u00b4oden and E\u00b4omer and all his men stared at them\nin wonder. Amid all the wreck of Isengard this seemed to them the\nstrangest sight. But before the king could speak, the small smoke-\nbreathing figure became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there\nsilent on the edge of the mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man\nhe looked, or like one, though not much more than half a man in\nheight; his head of brown curling hair was uncovered, but he was\nclad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the com-\npanions of Gandalf had worn when they rode to Edoras. He bowed\nvery low, putting his hand upon his breast. Then, seeming not to\nobserve the wizard and his friends, he turned to E\u00b4 omer and the king.\n\u2018Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!\u2019 he said. \u2018We are the doorward-\nens. Meriadoc, son of Saradoc is my name; and my companion, who,\nalas! is overcome with weariness\u2019 \u2013 here he gave the other a dig with\nhis foot \u2013 \u2018is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the House of Took.

{"581": "\u2018Doubtless he would!\u2019 laughed Gandalf. \u2018And was it Saruman that\nordered you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival\nof guests, when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?\u2019\n\u2018No, good sir, the matter escaped him,\u2019 answered Merry gravely.\n\u2018He has been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who\nhas taken over the management of Isengard. He commanded me\nto welcome the Lord of Rohan with fitting words. I have done my\nbest.\u2019\n\u2018And what about your companions? What about Legolas and me?\u2019\ncried Gimli, unable to contain himself longer. \u2018You rascals, you\nwoolly-footed and wool-pated truants! A fine hunt you have led us!\nTwo hundred leagues, through fen and forest, battle and death, to\nrescue you! And here we find you feasting and idling \u2013 and smoking!\nSmoking! Where did you come by the weed, you villains? Hammer\nand tongs! I am so torn between rage and joy, that if I do not burst,\nit will be a marvel!\u2019\n\u2018You speak for me, Gimli,\u2019 laughed Legolas. \u2018Though I would\nsooner learn how they came by the wine.\u2019\n\u2018One thing you have not found in your hunting, and that\u2019s brighter\nwits,\u2019 said Pippin, opening an eye. \u2018Here you find us sitting on a field\nof victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came\nby a few well-earned comforts!\u2019\n\u2018Well-earned?\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018I cannot believe that!\u2019\nThe Riders laughed. \u2018It cannot be doubted that we witness the\nmeeting of dear friends,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018So these are the lost ones\nof your company, Gandalf ? The days are fated to be filled with\nmarvels. Already I have seen many since I left my house; and now\nhere before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend. Are not\nthese the Halflings, that some among us call the Holbytlan?\u2019\n\u2018Hobbits, if you please, lord,\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Hobbits?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Your tongue is strangely changed; but\nthe name sounds not unfitting so. Hobbits! No report that I have\nheard does justice to the truth.\u2019\nMerry bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. \u2018You are gra-\ncious, lord; or I hope that I may so take your words,\u2019 he said. \u2018And\nhere is another marvel! I have wandered in many lands, since I left\nmy home, and never till now have I found people that knew any story\nconcerning hobbits.\u2019\n\u2018My people came out of the North long ago,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018But\nI will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. All that is\nsaid among us is that far away, over many hills and rivers, live the\nhalfling folk that dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no"}

But it seems that more\ncould be said.\u2019\n\u2018It could indeed, lord,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018For one thing,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden, \u2018I had not heard that they spouted\nsmoke from their mouths.\u2019\n\u2018That is not surprising,\u2019 answered Merry; \u2018for it is an art which\nwe have not practised for more than a few generations. It was Tobold\nHornblower, of Longbottom in the Southfarthing, who first grew the\ntrue pipe-weed in his gardens, about the year 1070 according to our\nreckoning. How old Toby came by the plant . . .\u2019\n\u2018You do not know your danger, The\u00b4oden,\u2019 interrupted Gandalf.\n\u2018These hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures\nof the table, or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and\ngreat-grandfathers, and remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you\nencourage them with undue patience. Some other time would be\nmore fitting for the history of smoking. Where is Treebeard, Merry?\u2019\n\u2018Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a drink \u2013 of\nclean water. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their\nwork \u2013 over there.\u2019 Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake;\nand as they looked, they heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if\nan avalanche was falling from the mountain-side. Far away came a\nhoom-hom, as of horns blowing triumphantly.\n\u2018And is Orthanc then left unguarded?\u2019 asked Gandalf.\n\u2018There is the water,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But Quickbeam and some others\nare watching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of\nSaruman\u2019s planting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot\nof the stair.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018but his arms are at\nhis sides, and he stands as still as a door-tree.\u2019\n\u2018It is past noon,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and we at any rate have not eaten\nsince early morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be.\nDid he leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from\nyour mind?\u2019\n\u2018He left a message,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018and I was coming to it, but I\nhave been hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if\nthe Lord of the Mark and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they\nwill find Treebeard there, and he will welcome them.

{"584": "Chapter 9\nFLOTSAM AND JETSAM\nGandalf and the King\u2019s company rode away, turning eastward to\nmake the circuit of the ruined walls of Isengard. But Aragorn, Gimli,\nand Legolas remained behind. Leaving Arod and Hasufel to stray in\nsearch of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.\n\u2018Well, well! The hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where\nnone of us ever thought to come,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018And now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,\u2019\nsaid Legolas, \u2018the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own\nsmall riddles. We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still\nmany things that I should like to know the truth of.\u2019\n\u2018And there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you,\u2019\nsaid Merry. \u2018We have learnt a few things through Treebeard, the Old\nEnt, but that is not nearly enough.\u2019\n\u2018All in good time,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018We were the hunters, and you\nshould give an account of yourselves to us first.\u2019\n\u2018Or second,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018It would go better after a meal. I have a\nsore head; and it is past mid-day. You truants might make amends\nby finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. Food and drink\nwould pay off some of my score against you.\u2019\n\u2018Then you shall have it,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Will you have it here, or in\nmore comfort in what\u2019s left of Saruman\u2019s guard-house \u2013 over there\nunder the arch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on\nthe road.\u2019\n\u2018Less than an eye!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But I will not go into any orc-house;\nnor touch Orcs\u2019 meat or anything that they have mauled.\u2019\n\u2018We wouldn\u2019t ask you to,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We have had enough of\nOrcs ourselves to last a life-time. But there were many other folk in\nIsengard. Saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his Orcs. He\nhad Men to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, I\nsuppose. Anyway they were favoured and got good provisions.\u2019\n\u2018And pipe-weed?\u2019 asked Gimli.\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 Merry laughed. \u2018But that is another story,\nwhich can wait until after lunch.\u2019\n\u2018Well let us go and have lunch then!\u2019 said the Dwarf.\nThehobbitsledtheway;andtheypassedunderthearchandcame"}

But light came in now through the broken roof.\nOn the hearth wood was burning.\n\u2018I lit a bit of fire,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018It cheered us up in the fogs. There\nwere few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was\nwet. But there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind\naway up through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked.\nA fire is handy. I will make you some toast. The bread is three or\nfour days old, I am afraid.\u2019\nAragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a\nlong table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors.\n\u2018Store-room in there, and above the floods, luckily,\u2019 said Pippin,\nas they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food\nof various sorts.\n\u2018And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master\nGimli,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018This is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as Treebeard\ncalls it. Will you have wine or beer? There\u2019s a barrel inside there \u2013\nvery passable. And this is first-rate salted pork. Or I can cut you\nsome rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. I am sorry there\nis no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the\nlast few days! I cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and\nhoney for your bread. Are you content?\u2019\n\u2018Indeed yes,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018The score is much reduced.\u2019\nThe three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits,\nunabashed, set to a second time. \u2018We must keep our guests company,\u2019\nthey said.\n\u2018You are full of courtesy this morning,\u2019 laughed Legolas. \u2018But\nmaybe, if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping\none another company again.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe; and why not?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018We had foul fare with the\nOrcs, and little enough for days before that. It seems a long while\nsince we could eat to heart\u2019s content.\u2019\n\u2018It does not seem to have done you any harm,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Indeed you look in the bloom of health.\u2019\n\u2018Aye, you do indeed,\u2019 said Gimli, looking them up and down over\nthe top of his cup. \u2018Why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when\nwe parted; and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if\nthat is possible for hobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate\nhas not starved you.\u2019\n\u2018He has not,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But Ents only drink, and drink is not\nenough for content.

{"586": "\u2018You have drunk of the waters of the Ents, have you?\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Ah, then I think it is likely that Gimli\u2019s eyes do not deceive him.\nStrange songs have been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.\u2019\n\u2018Many strange tales have been told about that land,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018I have never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the\nEnts!\u2019\n\u2018Ents,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018Ents are \u2013 well Ents are all different for one\nthing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.\u2019 He tried a few\nfumbling words that trailed off into silence. \u2018Oh, well,\u2019 he went on,\n\u2018you have seen some at a distance, already \u2013 they saw you at any\nrate, and reported that you were on the way \u2013 and you will see many\nothers, I expect, before you leave here. You must form your own\nideas.\u2019\n\u2018Now, now!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018We are beginning the story in the middle.\nI should like a tale in the right order, starting with that strange day\nwhen our fellowship was broken.\u2019\n\u2018You shall have it, if there is time,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But first \u2013 if you\nhave finished eating \u2013 you shall fill your pipes and light up. And then\nfor a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at Bree\nagain, or in Rivendell.\u2019\nHe produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. \u2018We have heaps\nof it,\u2019 he said; \u2018and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we\ngo. We did some salvage-work this morning, Pippin and I. There are\nlots of things floating about. It was Pippin who found two small\nbarrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house, I suppose.\nWhen we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine\na pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt.\u2019\nGimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. \u2018It feels\ngood, and it smells good,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018It is good!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf !\nThere were the Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as\nplain. How it came here, I can\u2019t imagine. For Saruman\u2019s private use,\nI fancy. I never knew that it went so far abroad. But it comes in\nhandy now!\u2019\n\u2018It would,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018if I had a pipe to go with it. Alas, I lost\nmine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?\u2019\n\u2018No, I am afraid not,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We have not found any, not\neven here in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself,\nit seems. And I don\u2019t think it would be any use knocking on the\ndoors of Orthanc to beg a pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes,\nas good friends must at a pinch.\u2019\n\u2018Half a moment!\u2019 said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast"}

I never really expected\nto find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. But\nnow it comes in useful after all.\u2019 He held up a small pipe with a wide\nflattened bowl, and handed it to Gimli. \u2018Does that settle the score\nbetween us?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Settle it!\u2019 cried Gimli. \u2018Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in\nyour debt.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I am going back into the open air, to see what the wind\nand sky are doing!\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018We will come with you,\u2019 said Aragorn.\nThey went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before\nthe gateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists\nwere lifting and floating away upon the breeze.\n\u2018Now let us take our ease here for a little!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We will\nsit on the edge of ruin and talk, as Gandalf says, while he is busy\nelsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.\u2019 He\nwrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched\nout his long legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin\nstream of smoke.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Strider the Ranger has come back!\u2019\n\u2018He has never been away,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018I am Strider and Du\u00b4na-\ndan too, and I belong both to Gondor and the North.\u2019\nThey smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them;\nslanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the West.\nLegolas lay still, looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and\nsinging softly to himself. At last he sat up. \u2018Come now!\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Time wears on, and the mists are blowing away, or would if you\nstrange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke. What of the tale?\u2019\n\u2018Well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself\nall strung-up in an orc-camp,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Let me see, what is\ntoday?\u2019\n\u2018The fifth of March in the Shire-reckoning,\u2019 said Aragorn. Pippin\nmade some calculations on his fingers. \u2018Only nine days ago!\u2019 he said.*\n\u2018It seems a year since we were caught. Well, though half of it was\nlike a bad dream, I reckon that three very horrible days followed.\nMerry will correct me, if I forget anything important: I am not going\ninto details: the whips and the filth and stench and all that; it does\nnot bear remembering.\u2019 With that he plunged into an account of\nBoromir\u2019s last fight and the orc-march from Emyn Muil to the Forest."}
{"588": "The others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their\nguesses.\n\u2018Here are some treasures that you let fall,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018You will\nbe glad to have them back.\u2019 He loosened his belt from under his\ncloak, and took from it the two sheathed knives.\n\u2018Well!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I never expected to see those again! I marked\na few orcs with mine; but Uglu\u00b4k took them from us. How he glared!\nAt first I thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things\naway as if they burned him.\u2019\n\u2018And here also is your brooch, Pippin,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018I have kept\nit safe, for it is a very precious thing.\u2019\n\u2018I know,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018It was a wrench to let it go; but what else\ncould I do?\u2019\n\u2018Nothing else,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018One who cannot cast away a\ntreasure at need is in fetters. You did rightly.\u2019\n\u2018The cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!\u2019\nsaid Gimli. \u2018Luck served you there; but you seized your chance with\nboth hands, one might say.\u2019\n\u2018And set us a pretty riddle,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I wondered if you had\ngrown wings!\u2019\n\u2018Unfortunately not,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018But you did not know about\nGrishna\u00b4kh.\u2019 He shuddered and said no more, leaving Merry to tell\nof those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath,\nand the dreadful strength of Grishna\u00b4kh\u2019s hairy arms.\n\u2018All this about the Orcs of Barad-du\u02c6r, Lugbu\u00b4rz as they call it,\nmakes me uneasy,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018The Dark Lord already knew too\nmuch, and his servants also; and Grishna\u00b4kh evidently sent some\nmessage across the River after the quarrel. The Red Eye will be\nlooking towards Isengard. But Saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick\nof his own cutting.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Things\nbegan to go all wrong for him from the moment his Orcs set foot in\nRohan.\u2019\n\u2018We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so Gandalf hints,\u2019 said\nGimli. \u2018On the edge of the Forest.\u2019\n\u2018When was that?\u2019 asked Pippin.\n\u2018Five nights ago,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Let me see,\u2019 said Merry: \u2018five nights ago \u2013 now we come to a part\nof the story you know nothing about. We met Treebeard that morning\nafter the battle; and that night we were at Wellinghall, one of his\nent-houses. The next morning we went to Entmoot, a gathering of\nEnts, that is, and the queerest thing I have ever seen in my life. It"}
{"589": "of their moot, the Ents suddenly blew up. It was amazing. The Forest\nhad felt as tense as if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it: then all\nat once it exploded. I wish you could have heard their song as they\nmarched.\u2019\n\u2018If Saruman had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by\nnow, even if he had had to run on his own legs,\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as\nbone,\nWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door!\nThere was very much more. A great deal of the song had no words,\nand was like a music of horns and drums. It was very exciting. But\nI thought it was only marching music and no more, just a song \u2013\nuntil I got here. I know better now.\u2019\n\u2018We came down over the last ridge into Nan Curun\u00b4\u0131r, after night\nhad fallen,\u2019 Merry continued. \u2018It was then that I first had the feeling\nthat the Forest itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming\nan entish dream, but Pippin had noticed it too. We were both fright-\nened; but we did not find out more about it until later.\n\u2018It was the Huorns, or so the Ents call them in \u2018\u2018short language\u2019\u2019.\nTreebeard won\u2019t say much about them, but I think they are Ents\nthat have become almost like trees, at least to look at. They stand\nhere and there in the wood or under its eaves, silent, watching end-\nlessly over the trees; but deep in the darkest dales there are hundreds\nand hundreds of them, I believe.\n\u2018There is a great power in them, and they seem able to wrap\nthemselves in shadow: it is difficult to see them moving. But they\ndo. They can move very quickly, if they are angry. You stand still\nlooking at the weather, maybe, or listening to the rustling of the wind,\nand then suddenly you find that you are in the middle of a wood\nwith great groping trees all around you. They still have voices, and\ncan speak with the Ents \u2013 that is why they are called Huorns, Tree-\nbeard says \u2013 but they have become queer and wild. Dangerous. I\nshould be terrified of meeting them, if there were no true Ents about\nto look after them.\n\u2018Well, in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the\nupper end of the Wizard\u2019s Vale, the Ents with all their rustling Huorns\nbehind. We could not see them, of course, but the whole air was full\nof creaking. It was very dark, a cloudy night. They moved at a great\nspeed as soon as they had left the hills, and made a noise like a\nrushing wind. The Moon did not appear through the clouds, and"}
{"590": "There was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, that\nwas all.\n\u2018Treebeard and a few more Ents crept on, right round to within\nsight of the great gates. Pippin and I were with him. We were sitting\non Treebeard\u2019s shoulders, and I could feel the quivering tenseness\nin him. But even when they are roused, Ents can be very cautious\nand patient. They stood still as carved stones, breathing and listening.\n\u2018Then all at once there was a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared,\nand the walls of Isengard echoed. We thought that we had been\ndiscovered, and that battle was going to begin. But nothing of the\nsort. All Saruman\u2019s people were marching away. I don\u2019t know much\nabout this war, or about the Horsemen of Rohan, but Saruman seems\nto have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one final\nblow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless lines of\nmarching Orcs; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And\nthere were battalions of Men, too. Many of them carried torches,\nand in the flare I could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary\nmen, rather tall and dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil-\nlooking. But there were some others that were horrible: man-high,\nbut with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed. Do you know,\nthey reminded me at once of that Southerner at Bree; only he was\nnot so obviously orc-like as most of these were.\u2019\n\u2018I thought of him too,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We had many of these\nhalf-orcs to deal with at Helm\u2019s Deep. It seems plain now that that\nSoutherner was a spy of Saruman\u2019s; but whether he was working\nwith the Black Riders, or for Saruman alone, I do not know. It is\ndifficult with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and\nwhen they are cheating one another.\u2019\n\u2018Well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at\nthe very least,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018They took an hour to pass out of the\ngates. Some went off down the highway to the Fords, and some\nturned away and went eastward. A bridge has been built down there,\nabout a mile away, where the river runs in a very deep channel. You\ncould see it now, if you stood up. They were all singing with harsh\nvoices, and laughing, making a hideous din. I thought things looked\nvery black for Rohan. But Treebeard did not move. He said: \u2018\u2018My\nbusiness is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018But, though I could not see what was happening in the dark, I\nbelieve that Huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were\nshut again. Their business was with Orcs I think. They were far down\nthe valley in the morning; or at any rate there was a shadow there\nthat one couldn\u2019t see through."}
{"591": "mering on the doors, and calling for Saruman. There was no answer,\nexcept arrows and stones from the walls. But arrows are no use\nagainst Ents. They hurt them, of course, and infuriate them: like\nstinging flies. But an Ent can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a\npin-cushion, and take no serious harm. They cannot be poisoned,\nfor one thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher than\nbark. It takes a very heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They\ndon\u2019t like axes. But there would have to be a great many axe-men\nto one Ent: a man that hacks once at an Ent never gets a chance of\na second blow. A punch from an Ent-fist crumples up iron like thin\ntin.\n\u2018When Treebeard had got a few arrows in him, he began to warm\nup, to get positively \u2018\u2018hasty\u2019\u2019, as he would say. He let out a great\nhoom-hom, and a dozen more Ents came striding up. An angry Ent\nis terrifying. Their fingers, and their toes, just freeze on to rock; and\nthey tear it up like bread-crust. It was like watching the work of great\ntree-roots in a hundred years, all packed into a few moments.\n\u2018They pushed, pulled, tore, shook, and hammered; and clang-bang,\ncrash-crack, in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in\nruin; and some were already beginning to eat into the walls, like\nrabbits in a sand-pit. I don\u2019t know what Saruman thought was hap-\npening; but anyway he did not know how to deal with it. His wizardry\nmay have been falling off lately, of course; but anyway I think he has\nnot much grit, not much plain courage alone in a tight place without\na lot of slaves and machines and things, if you know what I mean.\nVery different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame was not all\nalong mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Once he was as great as his fame made him.\nHis knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands mar-\nvellously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The\nwise he could persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That\npower he certainly still keeps. There are not many in Middle-earth\nthat I should say were safe, if they were left alone to talk with\nhim, even now when he has suffered a defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and\nGaladriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but\nvery few others.\u2019\n\u2018The Ents are safe,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018He seems at one time to have\ngot round them, but never again. And anyway he did not understand\nthem; and he made the great mistake of leaving them out of his\ncalculations. He had no plan for them, and there was no time to\nmake any, once they had set to work. As soon as our attack began,\nthefewremainingratsinIsengardstartedboltingthrougheveryhole"}
{"592": "many orc-folk, of any size, escaped. Not from the Huorns: there was\na wood full of them all round Isengard by that time, as well as those\nthat had gone down the valley.\n\u2018When the Ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to\nrubbish, and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted\nhim, Saruman fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates\nwhen we arrived: I expect he came to watch his splendid army march\nout. When the Ents broke their way in, he left in a hurry. They did\nnot spot him at first. But the night had opened out, and there was a\ngreat light of stars, quite enough for Ents to see by, and suddenly\nQuickbeam gave a cry \u2018\u2018The tree-killer, the tree-killer!\u2019\u2019 Quickbeam\nis a gentle creature, but he hates Saruman all the more fiercely for\nthat: his people suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He leapt down the\npath from the inner gate, and he can move like a wind when he is\nroused. There was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the\nshadows of the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs to the\ntower-door. But it was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after him,\nthat he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled when\nhe slipped in through the door.\n\u2018When Saruman was safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before\nhe set some of his precious machinery to work. By that time there\nwere many Ents inside Isengard: some had followed Quickbeam, and\nothers had burst in from the north and east; they were roaming about\nand doing a great deal of damage. Suddenly up came fires and foul\nfumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to spout and\nbelch. Several of the Ents got scorched and blistered. One of them,\nBeechbone I think he was called, a very tall handsome Ent, got caught\nin a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a horrible sight.\n\u2018That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused\nbefore; but I was wrong. I saw what it was like at last. It was stagger-\ning. They roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to\ncrack and fall at the mere noise of them. Merry and I lay on the\nground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears. Round and round the\nrock of Orthanc the Ents went striding and storming like a howling\ngale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts,\ntossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves. The tower was\nin the middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron posts and blocks\nof masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash against the\nwindows of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. He had not had\nany burns, luckily. He did not want his folk to hurt themselves in\ntheir fury, and he did not want Saruman to escape out of some hole\nin the confusion. Many of the Ents were hurling themselves against"}
{"593": "Anyway they could not get a grip on it, or make a crack in it; and\nthey were bruising and wounding themselves against it.\n\u2018So Treebeard went out into the ring and shouted. His enormous\nvoice rose above all the din. There was a dead silence, suddenly. In\nit we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower. That had\na queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now they\nbecame cold, grim as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered\nround Treebeard, standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little\nin their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had\nmade in his old head long before. Then they just faded silently away\nin the grey light. Day was dawning by that time.\n\u2018They set a watch on the tower, I believe, but the watchers were\nso well hidden in shadows and kept so still, that I could not see them.\nThe others went away north. All that day they were busy, out of\nsight. Most of the time we were left alone. It was a dreary day; and\nwe wandered about a bit, though we kept out of the view of the\nwindows of Orthanc, as much as we could: they stared at us so\nthreateningly. A good deal of the time we spent looking for something\nto eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was happening\naway south in Rohan, and what had become of all the rest of our\nCompany. Every now and then we could hear in the distance the\nrattle and fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills.\n\u2018In the afternoon we walked round the circle, and went to have a\nlook at what was going on. There was a great shadowy wood of\nHuorns at the head of the valley, and another round the northern\nwall. We did not dare to go in. But there was a rending, tearing noise\nof work going on inside. Ents and Huorns were digging great pits\nand trenches, and making great pools and dams, gathering all the\nwaters of the Isen and every other spring and stream that they could\nfind. We left them to it.\n\u2018At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming and\nbooming to himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched his\ngreat arms and legs and breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Tired?\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a\ngood draught of Entwash. We have worked hard; we have done more\nstone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many\na long year before. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not\nlinger near this gate or in the old tunnel! Water may come through\n\u2013 and it will be foul water for a while, until all the filth of Saruman\nis washed away. Then Isen can run clean again.\u2019\u2019 He began to pull\ndown a bit more of the walls, in a leisurely sort of way, just to amuse\nhimself."}
{"594": "was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the road. Merry and I lay\nquiet, and Treebeard hid himself in the shadows under the arch.\nSuddenly a great horse came striding up, like a flash of silver. It was\nalready dark, but I could see the rider\u2019s face clearly: it seemed to\nshine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat up, staring, with my\nmouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn\u2019t.\n\u2018There was no need. He halted just by us and looked down at us.\n\u2018\u2018Gandalf !\u2019\u2019 I said at last, but my voice was only a whisper. Did he\nsay: \u2018\u2018Hullo, Pippin! This is a pleasant surprise!\u2019\u2019? No, indeed! He\nsaid: \u2018\u2018Get up, you tom-fool of a Took! Where, in the name of wonder,\nin all this ruin is Treebeard? I want him. Quick!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once;\nand there was a strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of\nthem seemed surprised at all. Gandalf obviously expected to find\nTreebeard here; and Treebeard might almost have been loitering\nabout near the gates on purpose to meet him. Yet we had told the\nold Ent all about Moria. But then I remembered a queer look he\ngave us at the time. I can only suppose that he had seen Gandalf or\nhad some news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t\nbe hasty\u2019\u2019 is his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say much\nabout Gandalf \u2019s movements when he is not there.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Hoom! Gandalf !\u2019\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018\u2018I am glad you have come.\nWood and water, stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard\nto manage here.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Treebeard,\u2019\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018\u2018I need your help. You have done\nmuch, but I need more. I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Then those two went off and had a council together in some\ncorner. It must have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf\nwas in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace,\nbefore they passed out of hearing. They were only away a matter of\nminutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then Gandalf came back to\nus, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He did say he was glad\nto see us, then.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018But Gandalf,\u2019\u2019 I cried, \u2018\u2018where have you been? And have you\nseen the others?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Wherever I have been, I am back,\u2019\u2019 he answered in the genuine\nGandalf manner. \u2018\u2018Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news\nmust wait. This is a perilous night, and I must ride fast. But the\ndawn may be brighter; and if so, we shall meet again. Take care of\nyourselves, and keep away from Orthanc! Good-bye!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone. He had\nevidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked"}
{"595": "should. Hm, this is a bundle of news and no mistake! Well, now\nTreebeard must get busy again.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not\ncheer us up at all. But for the moment we thought more about you\nthree than about Frodo and Sam, or about poor Boromir. For we\ngathered that there was a great battle going on, or soon would be,\nand that you were in it, and might never come out of it.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Huorns will help,\u2019\u2019 said Treebeard. Then he went away and we\ndid not see him again until this morning.\n\u2018It was deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see\nnothing beyond it. Mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great\nblanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full\nof rustlings, creakings, and a murmur like voices passing. I think that\nhundreds more of the Huorns must have been passing by to help in\nthe battle. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south,\nand flashes of lightning far away across Rohan. Every now and then\nwe could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out sud-\ndenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were\nnoises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley\nechoed.\n\u2018It must have been about midnight when the Ents broke the dams\nand poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern\nwall, down into Isengard. The Huorn-dark had passed, and the thun-\nder had rolled away. The Moon was sinking behind the western\nmountains.\n\u2018Isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools.\nThey glittered in the last light of the Moon, as they spread over the\nplain. Every now and then the waters found their way down into\nsome shaft or spouthole. Great white steams hissed up. Smoke rose\nin billows. There were explosions and gusts of fire. One great coil of\nvapour went whirling up, twisting round and round Orthanc, until\nit looked like a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and moonlit above.\nAnd still more water poured in, until at last Isengard looked like a\nhuge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.\u2019\n\u2018We saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night,\nwhen we came to the mouth of Nan Curun\u00b4\u0131r,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We\nfeared that Saruman was brewing some new devilry for us.\u2019\n\u2018Not he!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018He was probably choking and not laughing\nany more. By the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk\ndown into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. We took refuge\nin that guardroom over there; and we had rather a fright. The lake"}

It was a\nsqueeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and half blocked\nwith fallen stone near the top. There we sat high up above the floods\nand watched the drowning of Isengard. The Ents kept on pouring in\nmore water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The\nfogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella\nof cloud: it must have been a mile high. In the evening there was a\ngreat rainbow over the eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted\nout by a thick drizzle on the mountain-sides. It all went very quiet.\nA few wolves howled mournfully, far away. The Ents stopped the\ninflow in the night, and sent the Isen back into its old course. And\nthat was the end of it all.\n\u2018Since then the water has been sinking again. There must be outlets\nsomewhere from the caves underneath, I think. If Saruman peeps\nout of any of his windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We\nfelt very lonely. Not even a visible Ent to talk to in all the ruin; and\nno news. We spent the night up on top there above the arch, and it\nwas cold and damp and we did not sleep. We had a feeling that\nanything might happen at any minute. Saruman is still in his tower.\nThere was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley. I\nthink the Ents and Huorns that had been away came back then; but\nwhere they have all gone to now, I don\u2019t know. It was a misty, moisty\nmorning when we climbed down and looked round again, and nobody\nwas about. And that is about all there is to tell. It seems almost\npeaceful now after all the turmoil. And safer too, somehow, since\nGandalf came back. I could sleep!\u2019\nThey all fell silent for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. \u2018There is\none thing I wonder about,\u2019 he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder:\n\u2018Wormtongue. You told The\u00b4oden he was with Saruman. How did\nhe get there?\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes, I forgot about him,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018He did not get here till\nthis morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when\nTreebeard appeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our\nnames outside.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,\u2019\u2019 he\nsaid; \u2018\u2018and to give you some news. Huorns have come back. All\u2019s well;\naye very well indeed!\u2019\u2019 he laughed, and slapped his thighs. \u2018\u2018No more\nOrcs in Isengard, no more axes!

But out of the mist there rode a man on an old tired\nhorse; and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself. There\nwas no one else. When he came out of the mist and suddenly saw\nall the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he sat and gaped, and his\nface went almost green. He was so bewildered that he did not seem\nto notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to turn\nhis horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides, put\nout a long arm, and lifted him out of the saddle. His horse bolted in\nterror, and he grovelled on the ground. He said he was Gr\u00b4\u0131ma, friend\nand counsellor of the king, and had been sent with important mes-\nsages from The\u00b4oden to Saruman.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full\nof foul Orcs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018so I was sent. And I have had a perilous\njourney, and I am hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way,\npursued by wolves.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to\nmyself \u2018\u2018liar\u2019\u2019. Treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for\nseveral minutes, till the wretched man was squirming on the floor.\nThen at last he said: \u2018\u2018Ha, hm, I was expecting you, Master Worm-\ntongue.\u2019\u2019 The man started at that name. \u2018\u2018Gandalf got here first. So\nI know as much about you as I need, and I know what to do with\nyou. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will. I am the\nmaster of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you\ncan go there and give him all the messages that you can think of.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Let me go, let me go!\u2019\u2019 said Wormtongue. \u2018\u2018I know the way.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018You knew the way, I don\u2019t doubt,\u2019\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018\u2018But things\nhave changed here a little. Go and see!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch, with\nus close behind, until he came inside the ring and could see all the\nfloods that lay between him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Let me go away!\u2019\u2019 he whined. \u2018\u2018Let me go away! My messages\nare useless now.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018They are indeed,\u2019\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018\u2018But you have only two\nchoices: to stay with me until Gandalf and your master arrive; or to\ncross the water. Which will you have?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot\ninto the water; but he drew back. \u2018\u2018I cannot swim,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018The water is not deep,\u2019\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018\u2018It is dirty, but that\nwill not harm you, Master Wormtongue.

{"598": "\u2018 \u2018\u2018Well, he has gone in,\u2019\u2019 he said when he returned. \u2018\u2018I saw him\ncrawling up the steps like a draggled rat. There is someone in the\ntower still: a hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and\nI hope the welcome is to his liking. Now I must go and wash myself\nclean of the slime. I\u2019ll be away up on the north side, if anyone wants\nto see me. There is no clean water down here fit for an Ent to drink,\nor to bathe in. So I will ask you two lads to keep a watch at the gate\nfor the folk that are coming. There\u2019ll be the Lord of the Fields of\nRohan, mark you! You must welcome him as well as you know how:\nhis men have fought a great fight with the Orcs. Maybe, you know\nthe right fashion of Men\u2019s words for such a lord, better than Ents.\nThere have been many lords in the green fields in my time, and I\nhave never learned their speech or their names. They will be wanting\nman-food, and you know all about that, I guess. So find what you\nthink is fit for a king to eat, if you can.\u2019\u2019 And that is the end of the\nstory. Though I should like to know who this Wormtongue is. Was\nhe really the king\u2019s counsellor?\u2019\n\u2018He was,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018and also Saruman\u2019s spy and servant in\nRohan. Fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight\nof the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must\nhave been almost punishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits\nhim.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I don\u2019t suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of kind-\nness,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018He seemed rather grimly delighted with the\nbusiness, and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe\nand drink. We spent a busy time after that, searching the flotsam, and\nrummaging about. We found two or three store-rooms in different\nplaces nearby, above the flood-level. But Treebeard sent some Ents\ndown, and they carried off a great deal of the stuff.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018We want man-food for twenty-five,\u2019\u2019 the Ents said, so you can\nsee that somebody had counted your company carefully before you\narrived. You three were evidently meant to go with the great people.\nBut you would not have fared any better. We kept as good as we\nsent, I promise you. Better, because we sent no drink.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018What about drink?\u2019\u2019 I said to the Ents.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018There is water of Isen,\u2019\u2019 they said, \u2018\u2018and that is good enough\nfor Ents and Men.\u2019\u2019 But I hope that the Ents may have found time\nto brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we\nshall see Gandalf \u2019s beard curling when he returns. After the Ents\nhad gone, we felt tired, and hungry. But we did not grumble \u2013 our\nlabours had been well rewarded.

The more I consider it, the more curious I find it. I have\nnever been in Isengard, but I have journeyed in this land, and I\nknow well the empty countries that lie between Rohan and the Shire.\nNeither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year,\nnot openly. Saruman had secret dealings with someone in the Shire,\nI guess. Wormtongues may be found in other houses than King\nThe\u00b4oden\u2019s.

The waters had\nnow nearly all subsided. Here and there gloomy pools remained,\ncovered with scum and wreckage; but most of the wide circle was\nbare again, a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock, pitted with black-\nened holes, and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this\nway and that. At the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds\nand slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great storm; and beyond\nthem the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between\nthe dark arms of the mountains. Across the waste they saw riders\npicking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already\nthey were drawing near to Orthanc.\n\u2018There is Gandalf, and The\u00b4oden and his men!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Let\nus go and meet them!\u2019\n\u2018Walk warily!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018There are loose slabs that may tilt up\nand throw you down into a pit, if you don\u2019t take care.\u2019\nThey followed what was left of the road from the gates to Orthanc,\ngoing slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. The riders,\nseeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and\nwaited for them. Gandalf rode forward to meet them.\n\u2018Well, Treebeard and I have had some interesting discussions, and\nmade a few plans,\u2019 he said; \u2018and we have all had some much-needed\nrest. Now we must be going on again. I hope you companions have\nall rested, too, and refreshed yourselves?\u2019\n\u2018We have,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But our discussions began and ended in\nsmoke. Still we feel less ill-disposed towards Saruman than we did.\u2019\n\u2018Do you indeed?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Well, I do not. I have now a last\ntask to do before I go: I must pay Saruman a farewell visit. Dangerous,\nand probably useless; but it must be done. Those of you who wish\nmay come with me \u2013 but beware! And do not jest! This is not the\ntime for it.\u2019\n\u2018I will come,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018I wish to see him and learn if he really\nlooks like you.\u2019\n\u2018And how will you learn that, Master Dwarf?\u2019 said Gandalf."}
{"601": "Well, we shall see, perhaps. He may be shy of showing himself before\nmany different eyes together. But I have ordered all the Ents to\nremove themselves from sight, so perhaps we shall persuade him to\ncome out.\u2019\n\u2018What\u2019s the danger?\u2019 asked Pippin. \u2018Will he shoot at us, and pour\nfire out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?\u2019\n\u2018The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light heart,\u2019\nsaid Gandalf. \u2018But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose\nto try. A wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And Saruman\nhas powers you do not guess. Beware of his voice!\u2019\nThey came now to the foot of Orthanc. It was black, and the rock\ngleamed as if it were wet. The many faces of the stone had sharp\nedges as though they had been newly chiselled. A few scorings, and\nsmall flake-like splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore\nof the fury of the Ents.\nOn the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great\ndoor, high above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window,\nopening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold\nof the door there mounted a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn\nby some unknown art of the same black stone. This was the only\nentrance to the tower; but many tall windows were cut with deep\nembrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes\nin the sheer faces of the horns.\nAt the foot of the stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted. \u2018I will\ngo up,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I have been in Orthanc and I know my peril.\u2019\n\u2018And I too will go up,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I am old, and fear no peril\nany more. I wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much\nwrong. E\u00b4omer shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not\nfalter.\u2019\n\u2018As you will,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Aragorn shall come with me.

At last the window above the\ndoor was unbarred, but no figure could be seen at its dark opening.\n\u2018Who is it?\u2019 said a voice. \u2018What do you wish?\u2019\nThe\u00b4oden started. \u2018I know that voice,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I curse the day\nwhen I first listened to it.\u2019\n\u2018Go and fetch Saruman, since you have become his footman,\nGr\u00b4\u0131ma Wormtongue!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018And do not waste our time!\u2019\nThe window closed. They waited. Suddenly another voice spoke,\nlow and melodious, its very sound an enchantment. Those who\nlistened unwarily to that voice could seldom report the words that\nthey heard; and if they did, they wondered, for little power remained\nin them. Mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to hear\nthe voice speaking, all that it said seemed wise and reasonable, and\ndesire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves.\nWhen others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast; and\nif they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of those\nunder the spell. For some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke\nto them, and when it spoke to another they smiled, as men do who\nsee through a juggler\u2019s trick while others gape at it. For many the\nsound of the voice alone was enough to hold them enthralled; but\nfor those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far\naway, and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them.\nBut none were unmoved; none rejected its pleas and its commands\nwithout an effort of mind and will, so long as its master had control\nof it.\n\u2018Well?\u2019 it said now with gentle question. \u2018Why must you disturb\nmy rest?

His face was long, with a high forehead, he had deep darkling\neyes, hard to fathom, though the look that they now bore was grave\nand benevolent, and a little weary. His hair and beard were white,\nbut strands of black still showed about his lips and ears.\n\u2018Like, and yet unlike,\u2019 muttered Gimli.\n\u2018But come now,\u2019 said the soft voice. \u2018Two at least of you I know\nby name.

Gandalf made no sign; but stood silent as stone, as one\nwaiting patiently for some call that has not yet come. The Riders\nstirred at first, murmuring with approval of the words of Saruman;\nand then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It seemed to them\nthat Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord.\nRough and proud now seemed all his dealings with The\u00b4oden.

There was a heavy silence.\nIt was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. \u2018The words of this\nwizard stand on their heads,\u2019 he growled, gripping the handle of his\naxe. \u2018In the language of Orthanc help means ruin, and saving means\nslaying, that is plain. But we do not come here to beg.\u2019\n\u2018Peace!\u2019 said Saruman, and for a fleeting moment his voice was\nless suave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone. \u2018I do not\nspeak to you yet, Gimli Glo\u00b4 in\u2019s son,\u2019 he said. \u2018Far away is your home\nand small concern of yours are the troubles of this land.

Will you have peace with\nme, and all the aid that my knowledge, founded in long years, can\nbring? Shall we make our counsels together against evil days, and\nrepair our injuries with such good will that our estates shall both\ncome to fairer flower than ever before?\u2019\nStill The\u00b4oden did not answer. Whether he strove with anger or\ndoubt none could say. E\u00b4 omer spoke.\n\u2018Lord, hear me!\u2019 he said. \u2018Now we feel the peril that we were"}

I say, The\u00b4oden King: shall we have peace and friend-\nship, you and I? It is ours to command.\u2019\n\u2018We will have peace,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden at last thickly and with an\neffort. Several of the Riders cried out gladly. The\u00b4oden held up his\nhand. \u2018Yes, we will have peace,\u2019 he said, now in a clear voice, \u2018we\nwill have peace, when you and all your works have perished \u2013 and\nthe works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us.

The others\nfollowed at an easy pace.\nEnts in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long\narms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back,\nwhen they had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was\nstill shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey\nruins falling into darkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the\ndistant stump of an old tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting,\nupon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of Fangorn.\nThey came to the pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was still\nstanding, but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken\ninto small pieces. Right in the middle of the road the long forefinger\nlay, white in the dusk, its red nail darkening to black.\n\u2018The Ents pay attention to every detail!\u2019 said Gandalf.\nThey rode on, and evening deepened in the valley.\n\u2018Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf ?\u2019 asked Merry after a while. \u2018I\ndon\u2019t know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but\nthe rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.\u2019\n\u2018So you heard that?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Don\u2019t let it rankle!

There was some link between Isengard and\nMordor, which I have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news\nI am not sure; but they did so. The Eye of Barad-du\u02c6r will be looking\nimpatiently towards the Wizard\u2019s Vale, I think; and towards Rohan.\nThe less it sees the better.\u2019\nThe road passed slowly, winding down the valley. Now further,\nand now nearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from\nthe mountains. All the mists were gone. A chill wind blew. The moon,\nnow waxing round, filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen. The\nshoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down to bare hills.\nThe wide plains opened grey before them.\nAt last they halted. Then they turned aside, leaving the highway\nand taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or\nso they came to a dale. It opened southward, leaning back into the\nslope of round Dol Baran, the last hill of the northern ranges,\ngreenfooted, crowned with heather. The sides of the glen were shaggy\nwith last year\u2019s bracken, among which the tight-curled fronds of\nspring were just thrusting through the sweet-scented earth.\nThornbushes grew thick upon the low banks, and under them they\nmade their camp, two hours or so before the middle of the night.\nThey lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading"}
{"614": "Guards were set, two at a watch. The rest, after they had supped,\nwrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. The hobbits\nlay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. Merry\nwas sleepy, but Pippin now seemed curiously restless. The bracken\ncracked and rustled, as he twisted and turned.\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 asked Merry. \u2018Are you lying on an ant-hill?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018but I\u2019m not comfortable. I wonder how long\nit is since I slept in a bed?\u2019\nMerry yawned. \u2018Work it out on your fingers!\u2019 he said. \u2018But you\nmust know how long it is since we left Lo\u00b4 rien.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, that!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I mean a real bed in a bedroom.\u2019\n\u2018Well, Rivendell then,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But I could sleep anywhere\ntonight.\u2019\n\u2018You had the luck, Merry,\u2019 said Pippin softly, after a pause. \u2018You\nwere riding with Gandalf.\u2019\n\u2018Well, what of it?\u2019\n\u2018Did you get any news, any information out of him?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most\nof it; you were close by, and we were talking no secrets. But you can\ngo with him tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him \u2013\nand if he\u2019ll have you.\u2019\n\u2018Can I? Good! But he\u2019s close, isn\u2019t he? Not changed at all.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes, he is!\u2019 said Merry, waking up a little, and beginning\nto wonder what was bothering his companion. \u2018He has grown, or\nsomething. He can be both kinder and more alarming, merrier and\nmore solemn than before, I think. He has changed; but we have not\nhad a chance to see how much, yet. But think of the last part of that\nbusiness with Saruman! Remember Saruman was once Gandalf \u2019s\nsuperior: head of the Council, whatever that may be exactly. He was\nSaruman the White. Gandalf is the White now. Saruman came when\nhe was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go,\nand he went!\u2019\n\u2018Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he\u2019s closer than ever\nthat\u2019s all,\u2019 Pippin argued. \u2018That\u2014glass ball, now. He seemed mighty\npleased with it. He knows or guesses something about it. But does\nhe tell us what? No, not a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved it\nfrom rolling into a pool. Here, I\u2019ll take that, my lad \u2013 that\u2019s all. I\nwonder what it is? It felt so very heavy.\u2019 Pippin\u2019s voice fell very low,\nas if he was talking to himself.\n\u2018Hullo!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018So that\u2019s what is bothering you? Now, Pippin\nmy lad, don\u2019t forget Gildor\u2019s saying \u2013 the one Sam used to quote:\nDo not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to"}
{"615": "affairs of Wizards,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I should like a bit of information as\nwell as danger. I should like a look at that ball.\u2019\n\u2018Go to sleep!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018You\u2019ll get information enough, sooner\nor later. My dear Pippin, no Took ever beat a Brandybuck for inquisi-\ntiveness; but is this the time, I ask you?\u2019\n\u2018All right! What\u2019s the harm in my telling you what I should like:\na look at that stone? I know I can\u2019t have it, with old Gandalf sitting\non it, like a hen on an egg. But it doesn\u2019t help much to get no more\nfrom you than a you-can\u2019t-have-it so-go-to-sleep!\u2019\n\u2018Well, what else could I say?\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Pippin, but\nyou really must wait till the morning. I\u2019ll be as curious as you like\nafter breakfast, and I\u2019ll help in any way I can at wizard-wheedling.\nBut I can\u2019t keep awake any longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split\nat the ears. Good night!\u2019\nPippin said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away;\nand it was not encouraged by the sound of Merry breathing softly,\nasleep in a few minutes after saying good night. The thought of the\ndark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet. Pippin felt\nagain its weight in his hands, and saw again the mysterious red depths\ninto which he had looked for a moment. He tossed and turned and\ntried to think of something else.\nAt last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round.\nIt was chilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. The moon was\nshining cold and white, down into the dell, and the shadows of the\nbushes were black. All about lay sleeping shapes. The two guards\nwere not in view: they were up on the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the\nbracken. Driven by some impulse that he did not understand, Pippin\nwalked softly to where Gandalf lay. He looked down at him. The\nwizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there was a\nglitter of eyes under his long lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. But\nGandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against\nhis will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard\u2019s head.\nHe was rolled in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and\nclose beside him, between his right side and his bent arm, there was\na hummock, something round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand\nseemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground.\nHardly breathing, Pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he\nknelt down. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted\nthe lump up: it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected.\n\u2018Only some bundle of oddments, perhaps, after all,\u2019 he thought with\na strange sense of relief; but he did not put the bundle down again."}
{"616": "Quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and\nkneeling down, laid it back by the wizard\u2019s hand. Then at last he\nlooked at the thing that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth\nglobe of crystal, now dark and dead, lying bare before his knees.\nPippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in his own cloak, and half turned\nto go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf moved in his sleep,\nand muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue;\nhis hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed\nand did not move again.\n\u2018You idiotic fool!\u2019 Pippin muttered to himself. \u2018You\u2019re going to\nget yourself into frightful trouble. Put it back quick!\u2019 But he found\nnow that his knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough\nto the wizard to reach the bundle. \u2018I\u2019ll never get it back now without\nwaking him,\u2019 he thought, \u2018not till I\u2019m a bit calmer. So I may as well\nhave a look first. Not just here though!\u2019 He stole away, and sat down\non a green hillock not far from his bed. The moon looked in over\nthe edge of the dell.\nPippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them.\nHe bent low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl\nof food, in a corner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and\ngazed at it. The air seemed still and tense about him. At first the\nglobe was dark, black as jet, with the moonlight gleaming on its\nsurface. Then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it, and\nit held his eyes, so that now he could not look away. Soon all the\ninside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the lights within were\nrevolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp and struggled;\nbut he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. Closer and\ncloser he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly for\na while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.\nThe cry was piercing. The guards leapt down from the banks. All\nthe camp was soon astir.\n\u2018So this is the thief !\u2019 said Gandalf. Hastily he cast his cloak over\nthe globe where it lay. \u2018But you, Pippin! This is a grievous turn to\nthings!\u2019 He knelt by Pippin\u2019s body: the hobbit was lying on his back,\nrigid, with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. \u2018The devilry! What\nmischief has he done \u2013 to himself, and to all of us?\u2019 The wizard\u2019s\nface was drawn and haggard.\nHe took Pippin\u2019s hand and bent over his face, listening for his\nbreath; then he laid his hands on his brow. The hobbit shuddered.\nHis eyes closed. He cried out; and sat up, staring in bewilderment\nat all the faces round him, pale in the moonlight."}
{"617": "understand? Say just that!\u2019 Then he struggled to get up and escape,\nbut Gandalf held him gently and firmly.\n\u2018Peregrin Took!\u2019 he said. \u2018Come back!\u2019\nThe hobbit relaxed and fell back, clinging to the wizard\u2019s hand.\n\u2018Gandalf !\u2019 he cried. \u2018Gandalf ! Forgive me!\u2019\n\u2018Forgive you?\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018Tell me first what you have done!\u2019\n\u2018I, I took the ball and looked at it,\u2019 stammered Pippin; \u2018and I saw\nthings that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn\u2019t.\nAnd then he came and questioned me; and he looked at me, and,\nand, that is all I remember.\u2019\n\u2018That won\u2019t do,\u2019 said Gandalf sternly. \u2018What did you see, and\nwhat did you say?\u2019\nPippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared\nat him in silence, except Merry who turned away. But Gandalf \u2019s face\nwas still hard. \u2018Speak!\u2019 he said.\nIn a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words\ngrew clearer and stronger. \u2018I saw a dark sky, and tall battlements,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018And tiny stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet\nhard and clear. Then the stars went in and out \u2013 they were cut off\nby things with wings. Very big, I think, really; but in the glass they\nlooked like bats wheeling round the tower. I thought there were nine\nof them. One began to fly straight towards me, getting bigger and\nbigger. It had a horrible \u2013 no, no! I can\u2019t say.\n\u2018I tried to get away, because I thought it would fly out; but when\nit had covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then he came. He did not\nspeak so that I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for\nso long?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018I did not answer. He said: \u2018\u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2019 I still did not answer,\nbut it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: \u2018\u2018A hobbit.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It\nwas cruel. It was like being stabbed with knives. I struggled. But he\nsaid: \u2018\u2018Wait a moment! We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman that\nthis dainty is not for him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand?\nSay just that!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Then he gloated over me. I felt I was falling to pieces. No, no! I\ncan\u2019t say any more. I don\u2019t remember anything else.\u2019\n\u2018Look at me!\u2019 said Gandalf.\nPippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze\nfor a moment in silence. Then his face grew gentler, and the shadow\nof a smile appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin\u2019s head.\n\u2018Allright!\u2019hesaid.\u2018Saynomore!Youhavetakennoharm.There"}
{"618": "ones might have done worse in such a pass. But mark this! You have\nbeen saved, and all your friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is\ncalled. You cannot count on it a second time. If he had questioned\nyou, then and there, almost certainly you would have told all that\nyou know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too eager. He did not\nwant information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he could deal\nwith you in the Dark Tower, slowly. Don\u2019t shudder! If you will\nmeddle in the affairs of Wizards, you must be prepared to think of\nsuch things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not\nturned out as evilly as they might.\u2019\nHe lifted Pippin gently and carried him back to his bed. Merry\nfollowed, and sat down beside him. \u2018Lie there and rest, if you can,\nPippin!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms\nagain, tell me of it! Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear\nhobbit, don\u2019t put a lump of rock under my elbow again! Now, I will\nleave you two together for a while.\u2019\nWith that Gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing\nby the Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. \u2018Peril comes in the night\nwhen least expected,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have had a narrow escape!\u2019\n\u2018How is the hobbit, Pippin?\u2019 asked Aragorn.\n\u2018I think all will be well now,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018He was not held\nlong, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. The memory,\nor the horror of it, will probably fade quickly. Too quickly, perhaps.\nWill you, Aragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a danger-\nous charge.\u2019\n\u2018Dangerous indeed, but not to all,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018There is one\nwho may claim it by right. For this assuredly is the palant\u00b4\u0131r of Orthanc\nfrom the treasury of Elendil, set here by the Kings of Gondor. Now\nmy hour draws near. I will take it.\u2019\nGandalf looked at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others,\nhe lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it.\n\u2018Receive it, lord!\u2019 he said: \u2018in earnest of other things that shall be\ngiven back. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not\nuse it \u2013 yet! Be wary!\u2019\n\u2018When have I been hasty or unwary, who have waited and prepared\nfor so many long years?\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Never yet. Do not then stumble at the end of the road,\u2019 answered\nGandalf. \u2018But at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others\nthat stand here! The hobbit, Peregrin, above all should not know\nwhere it is bestowed. The evil fit may come on him again. For alas!\nhe has handled it and looked in it, as should never have happened."}
{"619": "not at once guess the nature of the Stone. Then I was weary, and as\nI lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!\u2019\n\u2018Yes, there can be no doubt,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018At last we know the\nlink between Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is\nexplained.\u2019\n\u2018Strange powers have our enemies, and strange weaknesses!\u2019 said\nThe\u00b4oden. \u2018But it has long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar.\u2019\n\u2018That many times is seen,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But at this time we have\nbeen strangely fortunate. Maybe, I have been saved by this hobbit\nfrom a grave blunder. I had considered whether or not to probe this\nStone myself to find its uses. Had I done so, I should have been\nrevealed to him myself. I am not ready for such a trial, if indeed I\nshall ever be so. But even if I found the power to withdraw myself,\nit would be disastrous for him to see me, yet \u2013 until the hour comes\nwhen secrecy will avail no longer.\u2019\n\u2018That hour is now come, I think,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Not yet,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018There remains a short while of doubt,\nwhich we must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that the Stone\nwas in Orthanc \u2013 why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit\nwas captive there, driven to look in the glass for his torment by\nSaruman. That dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face\nof the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before he\nlearns his error. We must snatch that time. We have been too\nleisurely. We must move. The neighbourhood of Isengard is no place\nnow to linger in. I will ride ahead at once with Peregrin Took. It will\nbe better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.\u2019\n\u2018I will keep E\u00b4omer and ten Riders,\u2019 said the king. \u2018They shall ride\nwith me at early day.

The bright moonlight\nseemed to be suddenly cut off. Several of the Riders cried out, and\ncrouched, holding their arms above their heads, as if to ward off a blow\nfrom above: a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them. Cowering they\nlooked up. A vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud.\nIt wheeled and went north, flying at a speed greater than any wind of\nMiddle-earth. The stars fainted before it. It was gone.\nThey stood up, rigid as stones. Gandalf was gazing up, his arms\nout and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.\n\u2018Nazgu\u02c6l!\u2019 he cried. \u2018The messenger of Mordor.

Shadowfax stood\nthere already. Slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across\nhis shoulders, the wizard leapt upon the horse\u2019s back. Aragorn lifted\nPippin and set him in Gandalf \u2019s arms, wrapped in cloak and blanket.\n\u2018Farewell! Follow fast!\u2019 cried Gandalf. \u2018Away, Shadowfax!\u2019\nThe great horse tossed his head. His flowing tail flicked in the\nmoonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the earth, and was gone\nlike the north wind from the mountains.\n\u2018A beautiful, restful night!\u2019 said Merry to Aragorn. \u2018Some folk have\nwonderful luck. He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride\nwith Gandalf \u2013 and there he goes! Instead of being turned into a\nstone himself to stand here for ever as a warning.\u2019\n\u2018If you had been the first to lift the Orthanc-stone, and not he,\nhow would it be now?\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018You might have done worse.\nWho can say? But now it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At\nonce. Go and get ready, and bring anything that Pippin left behind.\nMake haste!\u2019\nOver the plains Shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no\nguidance. Less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the\nFords of Isen and crossed them. The Mound of the Riders and its\ncold spears lay grey behind them.\nPippin was recovering. He was warm, but the wind in his face was\nkeen and refreshing. He was with Gandalf. The horror of the Stone\nand of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left\nbehind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew\na deep breath.\n\u2018I did not know you rode bare-back, Gandalf,\u2019 he said. \u2018You\nhaven\u2019t a saddle or a bridle!\u2019\n\u2018I do not ride elf-fashion, except on Shadowfax,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018But Shadowfax will have no harness. You do not ride Shadowfax:\nhe is willing to carry you \u2013 or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It\nis then his business to see that you remain on his back, unless you\njump off into the air.\u2019\n\u2018How fast is he going?\u2019 asked Pippin. \u2018Fast by the wind, but very\nsmooth. And how light his footfalls are!\u2019\n\u2018He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,\u2019\nanswered Gandalf; \u2018but that is not fast for him. The land is rising a"}

He heard Gandalf singing softly\nto himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as\nthe miles ran under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of\nwhich the hobbit caught the words: a few lines came clear to his ears\nthrough the rushing of the wind:\nTall ships and tall kings\nThree times three,\nWhat brought they from the foundered land\nOver the flowing sea?\nSeven stars and seven stones\nAnd one white tree.\n\u2018What are you saying, Gandalf ?\u2019 asked Pippin.\n\u2018I was just running over some of the Rhymes of Lore in my mind,\u2019\nanswered the wizard. \u2018Hobbits, I suppose, have forgotten them, even\nthose that they ever knew.\u2019\n\u2018No, not all,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018And we have many of our own, which\nwouldn\u2019t interest you, perhaps. But I have never heard this one. What\nis it about \u2013 the seven stars and seven stones?\u2019\n\u2018About the palant\u00b4\u0131ri of the Kings of Old,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018And what are they?\u2019\n\u2018The name meant that which looks far away. The Orthanc-stone\nwas one.\u2019\n\u2018Then it was not made, not made\u2019 \u2013 Pippin hesitated \u2013 \u2018by the\nEnemy?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Nor by Saruman. It is beyond his art, and\nbeyond Sauron\u2019s too. The palant\u00b4\u0131ri came from beyond Westernesse,\nfrom Eldamar. The Noldor made them. Fe\u00a8anor himself, maybe,\nwrought them, in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured\nin years. But there is nothing that Sauron cannot turn to evil uses.\nAlas for Saruman! It was his downfall, as I now perceive. Perilous to\nus all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves. Yet\nhe must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it secret, for his own profit.\nNo word did he ever speak of it to any of the Council. We had not\nyet given thought to the fate of the palant\u00b4\u0131ri of Gondor in its ruinous\nwars. By Men they were almost forgotten.

{"622": "and astonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wonder-\ning how long it would last.\n\u2018To see far off, and to converse in thought with one another,\u2019 said\nGandalf. \u2018In that way they long guarded and united the realm of\nGondor. They set up Stones at Minas Anor, and at Minas Ithil, and\nat Orthanc in the ring of Isengard. The chief and master of these\nwas under the Dome of Stars at Osgiliath before its ruin.

I guess that it was the Ithil-stone, for\nhe took Minas Ithil long ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas\nMorgul, it has become.\n\u2018Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Saruman\nwas trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded\nfrom afar, and daunted when persuasion would not serve. The biter\nbit, the hawk under the eagle\u2019s foot, the spider in a steel web! How\nlong, I wonder, has he been constrained to come often to his glass\nfor inspection and instruction, and the Orthanc-stone so bent towards\nBarad-du\u02c6r that, if any save a will of adamant now looks into it, it\nwill bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? And how it draws one\nto itself ! Have I not felt it? Even now my heart desires to test my\nwill upon it, to see if I could not wrench it from him and turn it\nwhere I would \u2013 to look across the wide seas of water and of time to\nTirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of\nFe\u00a8anor at their work, while both the White Tree and the Golden\nwere in flower!\u2019 He sighed and fell silent.\n\u2018I wish I had known all this before,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I had no notion\nof what I was doing.\u2019\n\u2018Oh yes, you had,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You knew you were behaving\nwrongly and foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not"}

What more do you want to know?\u2019\n\u2018The names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole\nhistory of Middle-earth and Over-heaven and of the Sundering Seas,\u2019\nlaughed Pippin. \u2018Of course!

What could\nit do at Isengard?\u2019\n\u2018It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgu\u02c6 l,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It could\nhave taken you away to the Dark Tower.\u2019\n\u2018But it was not coming for me, was it?\u2019 faltered Pippin. \u2018I mean,\nit didn\u2019t know that I had . . .\u2019\n\u2018Of course not,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018It is two hundred leagues or more\nin straight flight from Barad-du\u02c6r to Orthanc, and even a Nazgu\u02c6l\nwould take a few hours to fly between them. But Saruman certainly\nlooked in the Stone since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought,\nI do not doubt, has been read than he intended. A messenger has\nbeen sent to find out what he is doing. And after what has happened\ntonight another will come, I think, and swiftly. So Saruman will come\nto the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in. He has no\ncaptive to send. He has no Stone to see with, and cannot answer the\nsummons. Sauron will only believe that he is withholding the captive\nand refusing to use the Stone. It will not help Saruman to tell the\ntruth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still\nsafe in Orthanc. So whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. Yet\nhe rejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! What he will do in such\na plight, I cannot guess. He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc,\nto resist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap\nthe Nazgu\u02c6l, or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the\nair. In that case let Rohan look to its horses!\n\u2018But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may be\nthat the counsels of the Enemy will be confused, or hindered by his\nwrath with Saruman. It may be that he will learn that I was there"}

{"627": "Chapter 1\n\u00b4\nTHE TAMING OF SMEAGOL\n\u2018Well, master, we\u2019re in a fix and no mistake,\u2019 said Sam Gamgee. He\nstood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo, and\npeered out with puckered eyes into the gloom.\nIt was the third evening since they had fled from the Company,\nas far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours\nduring which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes\nand stones of the Emyn Muil, sometimes retracing their steps because\nthey could find no way forward, sometimes discovering that they had\nwandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before. Yet\non the whole they had worked steadily eastward, keeping as near as\nthey could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot\nof hills. But always they found its outward faces sheer, high and\nimpassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its tumbled skirts\nlay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird\nwas to be seen.\nThe hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak,\nits feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands\ncrowned with drifting cloud. A chill wind blew from the East. Night\nwas gathering over the shapeless lands before them; the sickly green\nof them was fading to a sullen brown. Far away to the right the\nAnduin, that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the day, was\nnow hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not look beyond the River,\nback to Gondor, to their friends, to the lands of Men. South and\neast they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night, a dark\nline hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. Every now\nand again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of\nearth and sky.\n\u2018What a fix!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018That\u2019s the one place in all the lands we\u2019ve\never heard of that we don\u2019t want to see any closer; and that\u2019s the\none place we\u2019re trying to get to! And that\u2019s just where we can\u2019t get,\nnohow. We\u2019ve come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can\u2019t\nget down; and if we did get down, we\u2019d find all that green land a\nnasty bog, I\u2019ll warrant. Phew! Can you smell it?\u2019 He sniffed at the\nwind.\n\u2018Yes, I can smell it,\u2019 said Frodo, but he did not move, and his"}
{"628": "there, I wish I could come there quickly and make an end!\u2019 He\nshuddered. The wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold\ndecay. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, at last withdrawing his eyes, \u2018we cannot stay\nhere all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more sheltered spot, and\ncamp once more; and perhaps another day will show us a path.\u2019\n\u2018Or another and another and another,\u2019 muttered Sam. \u2018Or maybe\nno day. We\u2019ve come the wrong way.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It\u2019s my doom, I think, to go to that Shadow\nyonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to\nme? What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy\u2019s\nhands \u2013 and here I am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that\nsteers us? All my choices have proved ill. I should have left the\nCompany long before, and come down from the North, east of the\nRiver and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard of Battle Plain to\nthe passes of Mordor. But now it isn\u2019t possible for you and me alone\nto find a way back, and the Orcs are prowling on the east bank. Every\nday that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don\u2019t know\nwhat is to be done. What food have we got left?\u2019\n\u2018Only those, what d\u2019you call \u2019em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply.\nBut they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought,\nthough, when I first set tooth in them, that I should ever come to\nwish for a change. But I do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug \u2013\naye, half a mug \u2013 of beer would go down proper. I\u2019ve lugged my\ncooking-gear all the way from the last camp, and what use has it\nbeen? Naught to make a fire with, for a start; and naught to cook,\nnot even grass!\u2019\nThey turned away and went down into a stony hollow. The wester-\ning sun was caught into clouds, and night came swiftly. They slept\nas well as they could for the cold, turn and turn about, in a nook\namong great jagged pinnacles of weathered rock; at least they were\nsheltered from the easterly wind.\n\u2018Did you see them again, Mr. Frodo?\u2019 asked Sam, as they sat, stiff\nand chilled, munching wafers of lembas, in the cold grey of early\nmorning.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I\u2019ve heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two\nnights now.\u2019\n\u2018Nor me,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Grrr! Those eyes did give me a turn! But\nperhaps we\u2019ve shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. Gollum!\nI\u2019ll give him gollum in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.\u2019\n\u2018I hope you\u2019ll never need to,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I don\u2019t know how he\nfollowed us; but it may be that he\u2019s lost us again, as you say. In this"}
{"629": "\u2018I hope that\u2019s the way of it,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I wish we could be rid of\nhim for good!\u2019\n\u2018So do I,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but he\u2019s not my chief trouble. I wish we\ncould get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on the\neast side, stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me\nand that Shadow yonder. There\u2019s an Eye in it. Come on! We\u2019ve got\nto get down today somehow.\u2019\nBut that day wore on, and when afternoon faded towards evening\nthey were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of\nescape.\nSometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that\nthey heard faint sounds behind them, a stone falling, or the imagined\nstep of flapping feet on the rock. But if they halted and stood still\nlistening, they heard no more, nothing but the wind sighing over the\nedges of the stones \u2013 yet even that reminded them of breath softly\nhissing through sharp teeth.\nAll that day the outer ridge of the Emyn Muil had been bending\ngradually northward, as they struggled on. Along its brink there now\nstretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every\nnow and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep\nnotches in the cliff-face. To find a path in these clefts, which were\nbecoming deeper and more frequent, Frodo and Sam were driven to\ntheir left, well away from the edge, and they did not notice that for\nseveral miles they had been going slowly but steadily downhill: the\ncliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands.\nAt last they were brought to a halt. The ridge took a sharper bend\nnorthward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side\nit reared up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff\nloomed before them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They\ncould go no further forwards, and must turn now either west or east.\nBut west would lead them only into more labour and delay, back\ntowards the heart of the hills; east would take them to the outer\nprecipice.\n\u2018There\u2019s nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, Sam,\u2019 said\nFrodo. \u2018Let\u2019s see what it leads to!\u2019\n\u2018A nasty drop, I\u2019ll bet,\u2019 said Sam.\nThe cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down\nthey found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen\nfor days: twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree.\nMany were dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds.\nOnceinmilderdaystheremusthavebeenafairthicketintheravine,"}
{"630": "of the gully, which lay along the edge of a rock-fault, was rough with\nbroken stone and slanted steeply down. When they came at last to\nthe end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 he said. \u2018We must have come down a long way, or else\nthe cliff has sunk. It\u2019s much lower here than it was, and it looks easier\ntoo.\u2019\nSam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. Then\nhe glanced up at the great cliff rising up, away on their left. \u2018Easier!\u2019\nhe grunted. \u2018Well, I suppose it\u2019s always easier getting down than up.\nThose as can\u2019t fly can jump!\u2019\n\u2018It would be a big jump still,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018About, well\u2019 \u2013 he stood\nfor a moment measuring it with his eyes \u2013 \u2018about eighteen fathoms,\nI should guess. Not more.\u2019\n\u2018And that\u2019s enough!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Ugh! How I do hate looking down\nfrom a height! But looking\u2019s better than climbing.\u2019\n\u2018All the same,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018I think we could climb here; and I\nthink we shall have to try. See \u2013 the rock is quite different from what\nit was a few miles back. It has slipped and cracked.\u2019\nThe outer fall was indeed no longer sheer, but sloped outwards a\nlittle. It looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations\nhad shifted, so that its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving\ngreat fissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as\nwide as stairs.\n\u2018And if we\u2019re going to try and get down, we had better try at once.\nIt\u2019s getting dark early. I think there\u2019s a storm coming.\u2019\nThe smoky blur of the mountains in the East was lost in a deeper\nblackness that was already reaching out westwards with long arms.\nThere was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze.\nFrodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky. He strapped\nhis belt outside his cloak and tightened it, and settled his light pack\non his back; then he stepped towards the edge. \u2018I\u2019m going to try it,\u2019\nhe said.\n\u2018Very good!\u2019 said Sam gloomily. \u2018But I\u2019m going first.\u2019\n\u2018You?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018What\u2019s made you change your mind about\nclimbing?\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t changed my mind. But it\u2019s only sense: put the one lowest\nas is most likely to slip. I don\u2019t want to come down atop of you and\nknock you off \u2013 no sense in killing two with one fall.\u2019\nBefore Frodo could stop him, he sat down, swung his legs over\nthe brink, and twisted round, scrabbling with his toes for a foothold.\nIt is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more\nunwise."}
{"631": "for. Come back!\u2019 He took Sam under the armpits and hauled him\nup again. \u2018Now, wait a bit and be patient!\u2019 he said. Then he lay on\nthe ground, leaning out and looking down; but the light seemed to\nbe fading quickly, although the sun had not yet set. \u2018I think we could\nmanage this,\u2019 he said presently. \u2018I could at any rate; and you could\ntoo, if you kept your head and followed me carefully.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how you can be so sure,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Why! You can\u2019t\nsee to the bottom in this light. What if you comes to a place where\nthere\u2019s nowhere to put your feet or your hands?\u2019\n\u2018Climb back, I suppose,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Easy said,\u2019 objected Sam. \u2018Better wait till morning and more light.\u2019\n\u2018No! Not if I can help it,\u2019 said Frodo with a sudden strange vehe-\nmence. \u2018I grudge every hour, every minute. I\u2019m going down to try it\nout. Don\u2019t you follow till I come back or call!\u2019\nGripping the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he let himself\ngently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes\nfound a ledge. \u2018One step down!\u2019 he said. \u2018And this ledge broadens\nout to the right. I could stand there without a hold. I\u2019ll\u2014\u2014\u2019 his\nwords were cut short.\nThe hurrying darkness, now gathering great speed, rushed up from\nthe East and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of\nthunder right overhead. Searing lightning smote down into the hills.\nThen came a blast of savage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar,\nthere came a high shrill shriek. The hobbits had heard just such a\ncry far away in the Marish as they fled from Hobbiton, and even\nthere in the woods of the Shire it had frozen their blood. Out here\nin the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold blades\nof horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam fell flat on his\nface. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his\nhead and ears. He swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a\nwailing cry.\nSam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. \u2018Master,\nmaster!\u2019 he called. \u2018Master!\u2019\nHe heard no answer. He found he was shaking all over, but he\ngathered his breath, and once again he shouted: \u2018Master!\u2019 The wind\nseemed to blow his voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring\nup the gully and away over the hills, a faint answering cry came to\nhis ears:\n\u2018All right, all right! I\u2019m here. But I can\u2019t see.\u2019\nFrodo was calling with a weak voice. He was not actually very far\naway. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his"}
{"632": "him against the cliff, so that he had not toppled over. He steadied\nhimself a little, laying his face against the cold stone, feeling his heart\npounding. But either the darkness had grown complete, or else his\neyes had lost their sight. All was black about him. He wondered if\nhe had been struck blind. He took a deep breath.\n\u2018Come back! Come back!\u2019 he heard Sam\u2019s voice out of the black-\nness above.\n\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t see. I can\u2019t find any hold. I can\u2019t move yet.\u2019\n\u2018What can I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do?\u2019 shouted Sam, leaning\nout dangerously far. Why could not his master see? It was dim,\ncertainly, but not as dark as all that. He could see Frodo below him,\na grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff. But he was far out of\nthe reach of any helping hand.\nThere was another crack of thunder; and then the rain came. In\na blinding sheet, mingled with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter\ncold.\n\u2018I\u2019m coming down to you,\u2019 shouted Sam, though how he hoped\nto help in that way he could not have said.\n\u2018No, no! wait!\u2019 Frodo called back, more strongly now. \u2018I shall be\nbetter soon. I feel better already. Wait! You can\u2019t do anything without\na rope.\u2019\n\u2018Rope!\u2019 cried Sam, talking wildly to himself in his excitement and\nrelief. \u2018Well, if I don\u2019t deserve to be hung on the end of one as a\nwarning to numbskulls! You\u2019re nowt but a ninnyhammer, Sam\nGamgee: that\u2019s what the Gaffer said to me often enough, it being a\nword of his. Rope!\u2019\n\u2018Stop chattering!\u2019 cried Frodo, now recovered enough to feel both\namused and annoyed. \u2018Never mind your gaffer! Are you trying to tell\nyourself you\u2019ve got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it!\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Mr. Frodo, in my pack and all. Carried it hundreds of miles,\nand I\u2019d clean forgotten it!\u2019\n\u2018Then get busy and let an end down!\u2019\nQuickly Sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed\nat the bottom was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of\nLo\u00b4 rien. He cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift\nfrom Frodo\u2019s eyes, or else his sight was returning. He could see the\ngrey line as it came dangling down, and he thought it had a faint\nsilver sheen. Now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his\neyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning his weight forward, he made the\nend fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line with both\nhands.\nSam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or"}
{"633": "Thunder growled and rumbled in the distance, and the rain was\nstill falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully;\nbut they did not find much shelter there. Rills of water began to\nrun down; soon they grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on\nthe stones, and spouted out over the cliff like the gutters of a vast\nroof.\n\u2018I should have been half drowned down there, or washed clean\noff,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018What a piece of luck you had that rope!\u2019\n\u2018Better luck if I\u2019d thought of it sooner,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Maybe you\nremember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in\nthe Elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and I stowed a coil in my\npack. Years ago, it seems. \u2018\u2018It may be a help in many needs,\u2019\u2019 he\nsaid: Haldir, or one of those folk. And he spoke right.\u2019\n\u2018A pity I didn\u2019t think of bringing another length,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but\nI left the Company in such a hurry and confusion. If only we had\nenough we could use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?\u2019\nSam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: \u2018Five, ten,\ntwenty, thirty ells, more or less,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Who\u2019d have thought it!\u2019 Frodo exclaimed.\n\u2018Ah! Who would?\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Elves are wonderful folk. It looks a\nbit thin, but it\u2019s tough; and soft as milk to the hand. Packs close too,\nand as light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!\u2019\n\u2018Thirty ells!\u2019 said Frodo considering. \u2018I believe it would be enough.\nIf the storm passes before nightfall, I\u2019m going to try it.\u2019\n\u2018The rain\u2019s nearly given over already,\u2019 said Sam; \u2018but don\u2019t you\ngo doing anything risky in the dim again, Mr. Frodo! And I haven\u2019t\ngot over that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider\nit sounded \u2013 but one up in the air, if they can fly. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019d\nbest lay up in this crack till night\u2019s over.\u2019\n\u2018And I\u2019m thinking that I won\u2019t spend a moment longer than I\nneed, stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking\nover the marshes,\u2019 said Frodo.\nWith that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully\nagain. He looked out. Clear sky was growing in the East once more.\nThe skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main\nbattle had passed to spread its great wings over the Emyn Muil, upon\nwhich the dark thought of Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it\nturned, smiting the Vale of Anduin with hail and lightning, and cast-\ning its shadow upon Minas Tirith with threat of war. Then, lowering\nin the mountains, and gathering its great spires, it rolled on slowly\nover Gondor and the skirts of Rohan, until far away the Riders on\nthe plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as they rode"}
{"634": "appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent\nmoon.\n\u2018It\u2019s good to be able to see again,\u2019 said Frodo, breathing deep.\n\u2018Do you know, I thought for a bit that I had lost my sight? From the\nlightning or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at\nall, until the grey rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.\u2019\n\u2018It does look sort of silver in the dark,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Never noticed\nit before, though I can\u2019t remember as I\u2019ve ever had it out since I first\nstowed it. But if you\u2019re so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo, how are you\ngoing to use it? Thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that\u2019s no\nmore than your guess at the height of the cliff.\u2019\nFrodo thought for a while. \u2018Make it fast to that stump, Sam!\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first.\nI\u2019ll lower you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands\nto fend yourself off the rock. Though, if you put your weight on some\nof the ledges and give me a rest, it will help. When you\u2019re down, I\u2019ll\nfollow. I feel quite myself again now.\u2019\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 said Sam heavily. \u2018If it must be, let\u2019s get it over!\u2019 He\ntook up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink;\nthen the other end he tied about his own waist. Reluctantly he turned\nand prepared to go over the edge a second time.\nIt did not, however, turn out half as bad as he had expected. The\nrope seemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more\nthan once when he looked down between his feet. There was one\nawkward spot, where there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and\neven undercut for a short space; there he slipped and swung out on\nthe silver line. But Frodo lowered him slowly and steadily, and it was\nover at last. His chief fear had been that the rope-length would give\nout while he was still high up, but there was still a good bight in\nFrodo\u2019s hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: \u2018I\u2019m\ndown!\u2019 His voice came up clearly from below, but Frodo could not\nsee him; his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight.\nFrodo took rather more time to follow him. He had the rope about\nhis waist and it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it would\npull him up before he reached the ground; still he did not want to risk\na fall, and he had not quite Sam\u2019s faith in this slender grey line. He\nfound two places, all the same, where he had to trust wholly to it:\nsmooth surfaces where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit\nfingers and the ledges were far apart. But at last he too was down.\n\u2018Well!\u2019 he cried. \u2018We\u2019ve done it! We\u2019ve escaped from the Emyn\nMuil!Andnowwhatnext,Iwonder?Maybeweshallsoonbesighing"}
{"635": "hammers!\u2019 he said. \u2018Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to\na stump, and we\u2019re at the bottom. Just as nice a little stair for that\nslinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say\nwhich way we\u2019ve gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.\u2019\n\u2018If you can think of any way we could have both used the rope\nand yet brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninny-\nhammer, or any other name your gaffer gave you,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Climb\nup and untie it and let yourself down, if you want to!\u2019\nSam scratched his head. \u2018No, I can\u2019t think how, begging your\npardon,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I don\u2019t like leaving it, and that\u2019s a fact.\u2019 He\nstroked the rope\u2019s end and shook it gently. \u2018It goes hard parting with\nanything I brought out of the Elf-country. Made by Galadriel herself,\ntoo, maybe. Galadriel,\u2019 he murmured, nodding his head mournfully.\nHe looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in farewell.\nTo the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam\nfell over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him.\nFrodo laughed. \u2018Who tied the rope?\u2019 he said. \u2018A good thing it held as\nlong as it did! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!\u2019\nSam did not laugh. \u2018I may not be much good at climbing, Mr.\nFrodo,\u2019 he said in injured tones, \u2018but I do know something about\nrope and about knots. It\u2019s in the family, as you might say. Why, my\ngrand-dad, and my uncle Andy after him, him that was the Gaffer\u2019s\neldest brother, he had a rope-walk over by Tighfield many a year.\nAnd I put as fast a hitch over the stump as anyone could have done,\nin the Shire or out of it.\u2019\n\u2018Then the rope must have broken \u2013 frayed on the rock-edge, I\nexpect,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018I bet it didn\u2019t!\u2019 said Sam in an even more injured voice. He\nstooped and examined the ends. \u2018Nor it hasn\u2019t neither. Not a strand!\u2019\n\u2018Then I\u2019m afraid it must have been the knot,\u2019 said Frodo.\nSam shook his head and did not answer. He was passing the rope\nthrough his fingers thoughtfully. \u2018Have it your own way, Mr. Frodo,\u2019\nhe said at last, \u2018but I think the rope came off itself \u2013 when I called.\u2019\nHe coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack.\n\u2018It certainly came,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018and that\u2019s the chief thing. But\nnow we\u2019ve got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon.\nHow beautiful the stars are, and the Moon!\u2019\n\u2018They do cheer the heart, don\u2019t they?\u2019 said Sam looking up. \u2018Elvish\nthey are, somehow. And the Moon\u2019s growing. We haven\u2019t seen him\nfor a night or two in this cloudy weather. He\u2019s beginning to give\nquite a light.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Frodo; \u2018but he won\u2019t be full for some days. I don\u2019t"}
{"636": "Under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage\nof their journey. After a while Sam turned and looked back at the\nway they had come. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the\ndim cliff. \u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got the rope,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ve set a little\npuzzle for that footpad, anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on\nthose ledges!\u2019\nThey picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a\nwilderness of boulders and rough stones, wet and slippery with the\nheavy rain. The ground still fell away sharply. They had not gone\nvery far when they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly\nblack before their feet. It was not wide, but it was too wide to jump\nacross in the dim light. They thought they could hear water gurgling\nin its depths. It curved away on their left northward, back towards\nthe hills, and so barred their road in that direction, at any rate while\ndarkness lasted.\n\u2018We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the\ncliff, I think,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018We might find some nook there, or even a\ncave or something.\u2019\n\u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I\u2019m tired, and I don\u2019t think I can\nscramble among stones much longer tonight \u2013 though I grudge the\ndelay. I wish there was a clear path in front of us: then I\u2019d go on till\nmy legs gave way.\u2019\nThey did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the\nEmyn Muil. Nor did Sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only\nbare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again,\nhigher and more sheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they\njust cast themselves on the ground under the lee of a boulder lying\nnot far from the foot of the precipice. There for some time they sat\nhuddled mournfully together in the cold stony night, while sleep crept\nupon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off. The moon now\nrode high and clear. Its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks\nand drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, turning all the wide\nlooming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows.\n\u2018Well!\u2019 said Frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely\nround him. \u2018You sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket. I\u2019ll walk\nup and down on sentry for a while.\u2019 Suddenly he stiffened, and\nstooping he gripped Sam by the arm. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 he whispered.\n\u2018Look over there on the cliff !\u2019\nSam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. \u2018Ssss!\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018That\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s that Gollum! Snakes and adders! And to\nthink that I thought that we\u2019d puzzle him with our bit of a climb!"}
{"637": "Down the face of a precipice, sheer and almost smooth it seemed\nin the pale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin\nlimbs splayed out. Maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding\ncrevices and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but\nit looked as if it was just creeping down on sticky pads, like some\nlarge prowling thing of insect-kind. And it was coming down head\nfirst, as if it was smelling its way. Now and again it lifted its head\nslowly, turning it right back on its long skinny neck, and the hobbits\ncaught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, its eyes that\nblinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded\nagain.\n\u2018Do you think he can see us?\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Frodo quietly, \u2018but I think not. It is hard even\nfor friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot see you in the\nshadow even at a few paces. And I\u2019ve heard that he doesn\u2019t like Sun\nor Moon.\u2019\n\u2018Then why is he coming down just here?\u2019 asked Sam.\n\u2018Quietly, Sam!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018He can smell us, perhaps. And he\ncan hear as keen as Elves, I believe. I think he has heard something\nnow: our voices probably. We did a lot of shouting away back there;\nand we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m sick of him,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018He\u2019s come once too often for\nme, and I\u2019m going to have a word with him, if I can. I don\u2019t suppose\nwe could give him the slip now anyway.\u2019 Drawing his grey hood well\nover his face, Sam crept stealthily towards the cliff.\n\u2018Careful!\u2019 whispered Frodo coming behind. \u2018Don\u2019t alarm him!\nHe\u2019s much more dangerous than he looks.\u2019\nThe black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down,\nand perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliff \u2019s foot. Crouching stone-\nstill in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. He\nseemed to have come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about\nsomething. They could hear him snuffling, and now and again there\nwas a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse. He lifted his\nhead, and they thought they heard him spit. Then he moved on\nagain. Now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling.\n\u2018Ach, sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste less speed. We\nmusstn\u2019t rissk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious \u2013 gollum!\u2019\nHe lifted his head again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his\neyes. \u2018We hate it,\u2019 he hissed. \u2018Nassty, nassty shivery light it is \u2013 sss\n\u2013 it spies on us, precious \u2013 it hurts our eyes.\u2019\nHe was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and\nclearer.\u2018Whereissit,whereissit:myPrecious,myPrecious?It\u2019sours,"}
{"638": "\u2018It doesn\u2019t sound as if he knew we were here, does it?\u2019 whispered\nSam. \u2018And what\u2019s his Precious? Does he mean the\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Hsh!\u2019 breathed Frodo. \u2018He\u2019s getting near now, near enough to\nhear a whisper.\u2019\nIndeed Gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on\nits scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening.\nHis pale eyes were half unlidded. Sam restrained himself, though his\nfingers were twitching. His eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were\nfixed on the wretched creature as he now began to move again, still\nwhispering and hissing to himself.\nAt last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right\nabove their heads. From that point there was a sheer drop, for the\ncliff was slightly undercut, and even Gollum could not find a hold\nof any kind. He seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs\nfirst, when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. As he did\nso, he curled his legs and arms up round him, like a spider whose\ndescending thread is snapped.\nSam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between\nhim and the cliff-foot in a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get\nup, he was on top of him. But he found Gollum more than he\nbargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a\nfall. Before Sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound\nround him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly\nstrong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy\nfingers were feeling for his throat. Then sharp teeth bit into his shoul-\nder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into\nthe creature\u2019s face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not let go.\nThings would have gone ill with Sam, if he had been alone. But\nFrodo sprang up, and drew Sting from its sheath. With his left hand\nhe drew back Gollum\u2019s head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long\nneck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.\n\u2018Let go! Gollum,\u2019 he said. \u2018This is Sting. You have seen it before\nonce upon a time. Let go, or you\u2019ll feel it this time! I\u2019ll cut your throat.\u2019\nGollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. Sam got up,\nfingering his shoulder. His eyes smouldered with anger, but he could\nnot avenge himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones\nwhimpering.\n\u2018Don\u2019t hurt us! Don\u2019t let them hurt us, precious! They won\u2019t hurt\nus will they, nice little hobbitses? We didn\u2019t mean no harm, but they\njumps on us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. And we\u2019re\nso lonely, gollum. We\u2019ll be nice to them, very nice, if they\u2019ll be nice\nto us, won\u2019t we, yes, yess.\u2019"}
{"639": "\u2018But that would kill us, kill us,\u2019 whimpered Gollum. \u2018Cruel little\nhobbitses.

But\nwe can\u2019t do that, not as things are. Poor wretch! He has done us no\nharm.\u2019\n\u2018Oh hasn\u2019t he!\u2019 said Sam rubbing his shoulder. \u2018Anyway he meant\nto, and he means to, I\u2019ll warrant. Throttle us in our sleep, that\u2019s his\nplan.\u2019\n\u2018I daresay,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But what he means to do is another\nmatter.\u2019 He paused for a while in thought. Gollum lay still, but\nstopped whimpering. Sam stood glowering over him.\nIt seemed to Frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off,\nvoices out of the past:\nWhat a pity Bilbo did not stab the vile creature, when he had a chance!\nPity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike\nwithout need.\nI do not feel any pity for Gollum. He deserves death.\nDeserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And\nsome die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too\neager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety.\nEven the wise cannot see all ends.\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 he answered aloud, lowering his sword. \u2018But still I am\nafraid. And yet, as you see, I will not touch the creature. For now\nthat I see him, I do pity him.\u2019\nSam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one\nwho was not there. Gollum lifted his head.\n\u2018Yess, wretched we are, precious,\u2019 he whined. \u2018Misery misery!\nHobbits won\u2019t kill us, nice hobbits.\u2019\n\u2018No, we won\u2019t,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But we won\u2019t let you go, either.\nYou\u2019re full of wickedness and mischief, Gollum.

And\nwhere are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we\nwonders?\u2019 He looked up at them, and a faint light of cunning and\neagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking eyes.\nSam scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense\nthat there was something odd about his master\u2019s mood and that the\nmatterwasbeyondargument.AllthesamehewasamazedatFrodo\u2019s"}

{"641": "The hobbits seated themselves beside him, one on either side, with\ntheir backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need\nfor any arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep\nfor a moment. Slowly the moon went by. Shadows fell down from\nthe hills, and all grew dark before them. The stars grew thick and\nbright in the sky above. No one stirred. Gollum sat with his legs drawn\nup, knees under chin, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his\neyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking or listening.\nFrodo looked across at Sam. Their eyes met and they understood.\nThey relaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or\nseeming to. Soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard.\nGollum\u2019s hands twitched a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved\nto the left and the right, and first one eye and then the other opened\na slit. The hobbits made no sign.\nSuddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground\nwith a jump like a grasshopper or a frog, Gollum bounded forward\ninto the darkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had\nexpected. Sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his\nspring. Frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him.\n\u2018Your rope might prove useful again, Sam,\u2019 he said.\nSam got out the rope. \u2018And where were you off to in the cold hard\nlands, Mr. Gollum?\u2019 he growled. \u2018We wonders, aye, we wonders. To\nfind some of your orc-friends, I warrant. You nasty treacherous crea-\nture. It\u2019s round your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.\u2019\nGollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. He did not answer\nSam, but gave him a swift venomous look.\n\u2018All we need is something to keep a hold on him,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018We want him to walk, so it\u2019s no good tying his legs \u2013 or his arms,\nhe seems to use them nearly as much. Tie one end to his ankle, and\nkeep a grip on the other end.\u2019\nHe stood over Gollum, while Sam tied the knot. The result sur-\nprised them both. Gollum began to scream, a thin, tearing sound,\nvery horrible to hear. He writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his\nankle and bite the rope. He kept on screaming.\nAt last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could\nnot be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too\ntight, indeed hardly tight enough. Sam was gentler than his words.\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter with you?\u2019 he said. \u2018If you will try to run away,\nyou must be tied; but we don\u2019t wish to hurt you.\u2019\n\u2018It hurts us, it hurts us,\u2019 hissed Gollum. \u2018It freezes, it bites!

{"642": "\u2018No, I will not take it off you,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018not unless\u2019 \u2013 he paused\na moment in thought \u2013 \u2018not unless there is any promise you can make\nthat I can trust.\u2019\n\u2018We will swear to do what he wants, yes, yess,\u2019 said Gollum, still\ntwisting and grabbling at his ankle. \u2018It hurts us.\u2019\n\u2018Swear?\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol,\u2019 said Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes\nwide and staring at Frodo with a strange light. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol will swear\non the Precious.\u2019\nFrodo drew himself up, and again Sam was startled by his words\nand his stern voice. \u2018On the Precious? How dare you?\u2019 he said. \u2018Think!\nOne Ring to rule them all and in the Darkness bind them.\nWould you commit your promise to that, Sme\u00b4agol?

Then crawling to Frodo\u2019s\nfeet he grovelled before him, whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over\nhim, as if the words shook his very bones with fear. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol will\nswear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sme\u00b4agol will save it.\nBut he must swear on the Precious.\u2019\n\u2018No! not on it,\u2019 said Frodo, looking down at him with stern pity.\n\u2018All you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know\nit would drive you mad. Not on it. Swear by it, if you will. For you\nknow where it is. Yes, you know, Sme\u00b4agol. It is before you.\u2019\nFor a moment it appeared to Sam that his master had grown and\nGollum had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his\nbrightness in grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. Yet the\ntwo were in some way akin and not alien: they could reach one\nanother\u2019s minds. Gollum raised himself and began pawing at Frodo,\nfawning at his knees.\n\u2018Down! down!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Now speak your promise!\u2019\n\u2018We promises, yes I promise!\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018I will serve the master\nof the Precious. Good master, good Sme\u00b4agol, gollum, gollum!\u2019 Sud-\ndenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again.\n\u2018Take the rope off, Sam!\u2019 said Frodo.\nReluctantly Sam obeyed.

He suspected\nhim more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new Gollum,\nthe Sme\u00b4agol, less than the old.\n\u2018Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we\u2019re to call you,\u2019 he said, \u2018now\nfor it! The Moon\u2019s gone, and the night\u2019s going. We\u2019d better start.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 agreed Gollum, skipping about. \u2018Off we go! There\u2019s\nonly one way across between the North-end and the South-end. I\nfound it, I did. Orcs don\u2019t use it, Orcs don\u2019t know it.

Gollum\nled them back northward for a while along the way they had come;\nthen he slanted to the right away from the steep edge of the Emyn\nMuil, down the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below.\nThey faded swiftly and softly into the darkness.

{"644": "Chapter 2\nTHE PASSAGE OF\nTHE MARSHES\nGollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often\nusing his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to\nit to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought\nof escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them.\nAfter a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that\nthey had struck before; but they were now further from the hills.\n\u2018Here it is!\u2019 he cried. \u2018There is a way down inside, yes. Now we\nfollows it \u2013 out, out away over there.\u2019 He pointed south and east\ntowards the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy\nand foul even in the cool night air.\nGollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called\nto them. \u2018Here! We can get down here. Sme\u00b4agol went this way once:\nI went this way, hiding from Orcs.\u2019\nHe led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into\nthe gloom. It was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some\nfifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. There was running water\nat the bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers\nthat trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires\nbeyond. Gollum turned to the right, southward more or less, and\nsplashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed\ngreatly delighted to feel the water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes\neven croaking in a sort of song.\nThe cold hard lands\nthey bites our hands,\nthey gnaws our feet.\nThe rocks and stones\nare like old bones\nall bare of meat.\nBut stream and pool\nis wet and cool:\nso nice for feet!\nAnd now we wish\u2014\u2014"}

It did not occur to him that his master might also have\nthought of it, but he supposed Gollum had. Indeed how had Gollum\nkept himself in all his lonely wandering? \u2018Not too well,\u2019 thought Sam.\n\u2018He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like,\nif there ain\u2019t no fish, I\u2019ll wager \u2013 supposing as he could catch us\nnapping.

Frodo and Sam sat on one of the\nflats, resting their backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.\n\u2018We must take a little food,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Are you hungry, Sme\u00b4agol?\nWe have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.\u2019\nAt the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in Gollum\u2019s pale\neyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin\nsickly face. For a moment he relapsed into his old Gollum-manner.\n\u2018We are famisshed, yes famisshed we are, precious,\u2019 he said. \u2018What\nis it they eats? Have they nice fisshes?\u2019 His tongue lolled out between\nhis sharp yellow teeth, licking his colourless lips.\n\u2018No, we have got no fish,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018We have only got this\u2019 \u2013\nhe held up a wafer of lembas \u2013 \u2018and water, if the water here is fit to\ndrink.\u2019\n\u2018Yess, yess, nice water,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Drink it, drink it, while we\ncan! But what is it they\u2019ve got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty?\u2019\nFrodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its\nleaf-wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a\nspasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol\nsmells it!\u2019 he said. \u2018Leaves out of the Elf-country, gah! They stinks.\nHe climbed in those trees, and he couldn\u2019t wash the smell off his\nhands, my nice hands.\u2019 Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the\nlembas and nibbled it. He spat, and a fit of coughing shook him.\n\u2018Ach! No!\u2019 he spluttered. \u2018You try to choke poor Sme\u00b4agol. Dust\nand ashes, he can\u2019t eat that. He must starve. But Sme\u00b4agol doesn\u2019t\nmind. Nice hobbits! Sme\u00b4agol has promised. He will starve. He can\u2019t\neat hobbits\u2019 food. He will starve.

But perhaps you can\u2019t\neven try, not yet anyway.\u2019\nThe hobbits munched their lembas in silence. Sam thought that it\ntasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: Gollum\u2019s\nbehaviour had made him attend to its flavour again. But he did not\nfeel comfortable. Gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth,\nlike an expectant dog by a diner\u2019s chair. Only when they had finished\nand were preparing to rest, was he apparently convinced that they\nhad no hidden dainties that he could share in. Then he went and sat\nby himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.\n\u2018Look here!\u2019 Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not\nreallycarewhetherGollumheardhimornot.\u2018We\u2019vegottogetsome"}

Turn and about, same as before,\nwhile he\u2019s loose.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps you\u2019re right, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo speaking openly. \u2018There\nis a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep,\nI\u2019m not sure yet. Seriously though, I don\u2019t think there is any need\nfor fear \u2013 at present. Still watch if you wish. Give me about two\nhours, not more, and then call me.\u2019\nSo tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he\nslept, almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed\nno longer to have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep,\nquite unconcerned. Presently his breath was hissing softly through\nhis clenched teeth, but he lay still as stone. After a while, fearing that\nhe would drop off himself, if he sat listening to his two companions\nbreathing, Sam got up and gently prodded Gollum. His hands\nuncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. Sam bent\ndown and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no response, not\neven a catch in Gollum\u2019s breathing.\nSam scratched his head. \u2018Must really be asleep,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018And\nif I was like Gollum, he wouldn\u2019t wake up never again.\u2019 He restrained\nthe thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and\nwent and sat down by his master.\nWhen he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker\nthan when they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from\nhis own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that\nhe had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still\nfast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. Gollum was not to be\nseen. Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam\u2019s mind,\ndrawn from the Gaffer\u2019s large paternal word-hoard; then it also\noccurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the\npresent been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both\nalive and unthrottled.\n\u2018Poor wretch!\u2019 he said half remorsefully. \u2018Now I wonder where\nhe\u2019s got to?\u2019\n\u2018Not far, not far!\u2019 said a voice above him. He looked up and saw\nthe shape of Gollum\u2019s large head and ears against the evening sky.\n\u2018Here, what are you doing?\u2019 cried Sam, his suspicions coming back\nas soon as he saw that shape.\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol is hungry,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Be back soon.\u2019\n\u2018Come back now!\u2019 shouted Sam. \u2018Hi! Come back!\u2019 But Gollum\nhad vanished."}
{"648": "\u2018I dunno,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018After sundown, I reckon.

The promise will hold yet a while. And he won\u2019t\nleave his Precious, anyway.\u2019\nFrodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly\nfor hours with Gollum, and a very hungry Gollum too, loose beside\nthem. \u2018Don\u2019t think of any of your gaffer\u2019s hard names,\u2019 he said. \u2018You\nwere worn out, and it has turned out well: we are now both rested.\nAnd we have a hard road ahead, the worst road of all.\u2019\n\u2018About the food,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018How long\u2019s it going to take us to do\nthis job? And when it\u2019s done, what are we going to do then? This\nwaybread keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way, though it\ndoesn\u2019t satisfy the innards proper, as you might say: not to my feeling\nanyhow, meaning no disrespect to them as made it.

We\u2019ve been a bit free with it so far.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how long we shall take to \u2013 to finish,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018We\nwere miserably delayed in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee, my dear\nhobbit \u2013 indeed, Sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends \u2013 I do not\nthink we need give thought to what comes after that. To do the job\nas you put it \u2013 what hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do,\nwho knows what will come of that? If the One goes into the Fire,\nand we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are we ever likely to need bread\nagain? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs to bring us to Mount\nDoom, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin to feel.\u2019\nSam nodded silently. He took his master\u2019s hand and bent over it. He\ndid not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his\nsleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle,\nand saying between the efforts: \u2018Where\u2019s that dratted creature?\u2019\nIt was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so\nquietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them. His\nfingers and face were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing\nand slavering. What he was chewing, they did not ask or like to think.\n\u2018Worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,\u2019 thought Sam.\n\u2018Brr! The nasty creature; the poor wretch!\u2019\nGollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and\nwashed himself in the stream. Then he came up to them, licking his\nlips. \u2018Better now,\u2019 he said. \u2018Are we rested? Ready to go on? Nice\nhobbits, they sleep beautifully. Trust Sme\u00b4agol now?

The\nbanks became moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting\nstone the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was\nlost. Dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind.\nOn either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay, stretching\naway southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled\nand smoked from dark and noisome pools. The reek of them hung\nstifling in the still air. Far away, now almost due south, the mountain-\nwalls of Mordor loomed, like a black bar of rugged clouds floating\nabove a dangerous fog-bound sea.\nThe hobbits were now wholly in the hands of Gollum. They did\nnot know, and could not guess in that misty light, that they were in\nfact only just within the northern borders of the marshes, the main\nexpanse of which lay south of them. They could, if they had known\nthe lands, with some delay have retraced their steps a little, and then\nturning east have come round over hard roads to the bare plain of\nDagorlad: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of Mordor.\nNot that there was great hope in such a course.

{"650": "It was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-\nreeks lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and\nGollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a\nbrief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent\nworld, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that\nthey had left or the mountains that they sought. They went slowly\nin single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo.\nFrodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they\nwent, he often lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked\nlike one vast fen was really an endless network of pools, and soft mires,\nand winding half-strangled water-courses. Among these a cunning eye\nand foot could thread a wandering path. Gollum certainly had that\ncunning, and needed all of it. His head on its long neck was ever\nturning this way and that, while he sniffed and muttered all the\ntime to himself. Sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt\nthem, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing the ground\nwith fingers or toes, or merely listening with one ear pressed to the\nearth.\nIt was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway\nin this forsaken country. The only green was the scum of livid weed\non the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses and\nrotting reeds loomed up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-\nforgotten summers.\nAs the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted,\ngrowing thinner and more transparent. Far above the rot and vapours\nof the world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene\ncountry with floors of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her\ncould they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth.\nBut even at this faint reminder of her presence Gollum scowled and\nflinched. He halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little\nhunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. There\nwas a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver\nof empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small\nair-movements that they could not feel.\n\u2018Not a bird!\u2019 said Sam mournfully.\n\u2018No, no birds,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Nice birds!\u2019 He licked his teeth. \u2018No\nbirds here. There are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. Lots of\nthings, lots of nasty things. No birds,\u2019 he ended sadly. Sam looked\nat him with distaste.\nSo passed the third day of their journey with Gollum. Before the\nshadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again,"}

They had\ncome to the very midst of the Dead Marshes, and it was dark.\nThey walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following\nattentively every move that Gollum made. The fens grew more wet,\nopening into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and\nmore difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without\nsinking into gurgling mud. The travellers were light, or maybe none\nof them would ever have found a way through.\nPresently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and\nheavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam rubbed his eyes: he\nthought his head was going queer. He first saw one with the corner\nof his left eye, a wisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others\nappeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke, some like misty\nflames flickering slowly above unseen candles; here and there they\ntwisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands. But neither of\nhis companions spoke a word.\nAt last Sam could bear it no longer. \u2018What\u2019s all this, Gollum?\u2019 he\nsaid in a whisper. \u2018These lights? They\u2019re all round us now. Are we\ntrapped? Who are they?\u2019\nGollum looked up. A dark water was before him, and he was\ncrawling on the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. \u2018Yes,\nthey are all round us,\u2019 he whispered. \u2018The tricksy lights. Candles of\ncorpses, yes, yes. Don\u2019t you heed them! Don\u2019t look! Don\u2019t follow\nthem! Where\u2019s the master?\u2019\nSam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He\ncould not see him. He went some paces back into the darkness, not\ndaring to move far, or to call in more than a hoarse whisper. Suddenly\nhe stumbled against Frodo, who was standing lost in thought, looking\nat the pale lights. His hands hung stiff at his sides; water and slime\nwere dripping from them.\n\u2018Come, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Don\u2019t look at them! Gollum says\nwe mustn\u2019t. Let\u2019s keep up with him and get out of this cursed place\nas quick as we can \u2013 if we can!\u2019\n\u2018All right,\u2019 said Frodo, as if returning out of a dream. \u2018I\u2019m coming.\nGo on!\u2019\nHurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some\nold root or tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which\nsank deep into sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the\nsurface of the dark mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell\nwent up, the lights flickered and danced and swirled. For a moment\nthe water below him looked like some window, glazed with grimy\nglass,throughwhichhewaspeering.Wrenchinghishandsoutofthe"}
{"652": "Gollum laughed. \u2018The Dead Marshes, yes, yes: that is their name,\u2019\nhe cackled. \u2018You should not look in when the candles are lit.\u2019\n\u2018Who are they? What are they?\u2019 asked Sam shuddering, turning to\nFrodo, who was now behind him.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. \u2018But I have seen\nthem too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the\npools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw them: grim\nfaces and evil, and noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair,\nand weeds in their silver hair. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell\nlight is in them.\u2019 Frodo hid his eyes in his hands. \u2018I know not who\nthey are; but I thought I saw there Men and Elves, and Orcs beside\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and\nOrcs. The Dead Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so\nthey told him when Sme\u00b4agol was young, when I was young before\nthe Precious came. It was a great battle. Tall Men with long swords,\nand terrible Elves, and Orcses shrieking. They fought on the plain\nfor days and months at the Black Gates. But the Marshes have grown\nsince then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.\u2019\n\u2018But that is an age and more ago,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018The Dead can\u2019t be\nreally there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land?\u2019\n\u2018Who knows? Sme\u00b4agol doesn\u2019t know,\u2019 answered Gollum. \u2018You\ncannot reach them, you cannot touch them. We tried once, yes,\nprecious. I tried once; but you cannot reach them. Only shapes to\nsee, perhaps, not to touch. No precious! All dead.\u2019\nSam looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he\nguessed why Sme\u00b4agol had tried to touch them. \u2018Well, I don\u2019t want\nto see them,\u2019 he said. \u2018Never again! Can\u2019t we get on and get away?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully!\nOr hobbits go down to join the Dead ones and light little candles.\nFollow Sme\u00b4agol! Don\u2019t look at lights!\u2019\nHe crawled away to the right, seeking for a path round the mere.\nThey came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as\nhe did. \u2018Three precious little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this\ngoes on much longer,\u2019 thought Sam.\nAt last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed\nit, perilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tuss-\nock to another. Often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first\ninto waters as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled\nalmost up to their necks and stank in one another\u2019s nostrils.\nItwaslateinthenightwhenatlengththeyreachedfirmerground"}

Brave hobbits! Very very\nweary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take\nmaster away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.\u2019 With these\nwords he started off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to\nbe a long lane between high reeds, and they stumbled after him as\nquickly as they could. But in a little while he stopped suddenly and\nsniffed the air doubtfully, hissing as if he was troubled or displeased\nagain.\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. \u2018What\u2019s the\nneed to sniff ? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held.\nYou stink, and master stinks; the whole place stinks.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, yes, and Sam stinks!\u2019 answered Gollum. \u2018Poor Sme\u00b4agol\nsmells it, but good Sme\u00b4agol bears it.

For some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what\nwas troubling him. Then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and\nlistening. To Frodo and Sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a\nlong wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. They shivered. At the same\nmoment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them; and it\ngrew very cold. As they stood straining their ears, they heard a noise\nlike a wind coming in the distance. The misty lights wavered,\ndimmed, and went out.\nGollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to him-\nself, until with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling\nover the marshes. The night became less dark, light enough for them\nto see, or half see, shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it\nrolled over them and passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds\nbreaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glim-\nmered out, riding in the flying wrack.\nFor a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits;\nbut Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face.\nThen Frodo and Sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the\nfresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills;\na black shadow loosed from Mordor; a vast shape winged and omin-\nous. It scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away"}
{"654": "shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right\nabove them, sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then\nit was gone, flying back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of\nSauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the Dead\nMarshes bare and bleak. The naked waste, as far as the eye could\npierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled\nwith the fitful moonlight.\nFrodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened\nfrom an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. But\nGollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused\nhim with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but\nknelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his\nlarge flat hands.\n\u2018Wraiths!\u2019 he wailed. \u2018Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their\nmaster. They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from\nthem. Curse the White Face! And they tell Him everything. He sees,\nHe knows. Ach, gollum, gollum, gollum!\u2019 It was not until the moon\nhad sunk, westering far away beyond Tol Brandir, that he would get\nup or make a move.\nFrom that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum\nagain. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam sur-\nprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards\nFrodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of\nspeaking. And Sam had another growing anxiety. Frodo seemed to\nbe weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing, indeed\nhe hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like\none who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and\nhe dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg\nGollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.\nIn fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the\nRing on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was\nnow beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards.\nBut far more he was troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself.\nIt was that more than the drag of the Ring that made him cower and\nstoop as he walked. The Eye: that horrible growing sense of a hostile\nwill that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and\nearth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze,\nnaked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become\nthat still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the present habitation\nand heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the\ndirection of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its"}
{"655": "on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the\nlust of the Ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made\nhalf in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess. Frodo gave\nno thought to it. Sam\u2019s mind was occupied mostly with his master,\nhardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. He\nput Frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every\nmovement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to\nencourage him with clumsy words.\nWhen day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much\ncloser the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now\nclearer and colder, and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were\nno longer a cloudy menace on the edge of sight, but as grim black\ntowers they frowned across a dismal waste. The marshes were at an\nend, dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud.\nThe land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and pitiless,\ntowards the desert that lay at Sauron\u2019s gate.\nWhile the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like\nworms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them\nwith its cruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of\ngrowing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For\ntwo more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land.\nThe air, as it seemed to them, grew harsh, and filled with a bitter\nreek that caught their breath and parched their mouths.\nAt last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum,\nthey halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great\nmountains reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their\nfeet were flung huge buttresses and broken hills that were now at the\nnearest scarce a dozen miles away. Frodo looked round in horror.\nDreadful as the Dead Marshes had been, and the arid moors of the\nNoman-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling\nday now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes. Even to the Mere of\nDead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring would come; but\nhere neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here nothing\nlived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The\ngasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white\nand grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails\nupon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock,\ngreat cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an\nobscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant\nlight.\nThey had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the"}
{"656": "beyond all healing \u2013 unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash\nit with oblivion. \u2018I feel sick,\u2019 said Sam. Frodo did not speak.\nFor a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where\nnightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only\ncome to morning through the shadows. The light broadened and\nhardened. The gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously\nclear. The sun was up, walking among clouds and long flags of smoke,\nbut even the sunlight was defiled. The hobbits had no welcome for\nthat light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them in their helplessness\n\u2013 little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash-heaps of the\nDark Lord.\nToo weary to go further they sought for some place where they\ncould rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow\nof a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their\nthroats and choking them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering\nand cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits\nhe crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him until\nthey came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west.\nIt was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze\nlay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow\nto escape the attention of the Eye.\nThe day passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they\ndrank only a few drops from their bottles \u2013 last filled in the gully,\nwhich now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place\nof peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first,\ntired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun\nfar away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, Sam dozed. It\nwas Frodo\u2019s turn to be on guard. He lay back on the slope of the\npit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. He\nlooked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark\nriding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hover-\ning between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.\nSuddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling.\nIt was evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep,\nand had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit. Gollum was by\nhim. For a moment Sam thought that he was trying to rouse Frodo;\nthen he saw that it was not so. Gollum was talking to himself. Sme\u00b4agol\nwas holding a debate with some other thought that used the same\nvoice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light and a green light\nalternated in his eyes as he spoke."}

Finally both arms, with long\nfingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck.\nSam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every\nmove that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his\nsimple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed\nthe chief danger in Gollum. He realized now that it was not so:\nGollum was feeling the terrible call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was\nHe, of course; but Sam wondered who She was. One of the nasty\nfriends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed.\nThen he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far enough,\nand were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs,\nbut he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned\nhim to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate.\nHe let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.\n\u2018What\u2019s the time?\u2019 he said sleepily.\nGollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth.

He had been dreaming.\nThe dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this\nland of disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of\nit he felt glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on\nhim. Gollum welcomed him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and\nchattered, cracking his long fingers, and pawing at Frodo\u2019s knees.\nFrodo smiled at him.\n\u2018Come!\u2019 he said. \u2018You have guided us well and faithfully.

{"660": "Chapter 3\nTHE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED\nBefore the next day dawned their journey to Mordor was over. The\nmarshes and the desert were behind them. Before them, darkling\nagainst a pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening\nheads.\nUpon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of Ephel\nDu\u00b4ath, the Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north the broken\npeaks and barren ridges of Ered Lithui, grey as ash. But as these\nranges approached one another, being indeed but parts of one great\nwall about the mournful plains of Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the\nbitter inland sea of Nu\u00b4rnen amidmost, they swung out long arms\nnorthward; and between these arms there was a deep defile. This\nwas Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land of the\nEnemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from\nits mouth were two sheer hills, black-boned and bare. Upon them\nstood the Teeth of Mordor, two towers strong and tall. In days long\npast they were built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power,\nafter the overthrow of Sauron and his flight, lest he should seek to\nreturn to his old realm. But the strength of Gondor failed, and men\nslept, and for long years the towers stood empty. Then Sauron\nreturned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen into decay, were\nrepaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance.\nStony-faced they were, with dark window-holes staring north and\neast and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes.\nAcross the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord\nhad built a rampart of stone. In it there was a single gate of iron,\nand upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the\nhills on either side the rock was bored into a hundred caves and\nmaggot-holes; there a host of orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue\nforth like black ants going to war. None could pass the Teeth of\nMordor and not feel their bite, unless they were summoned by\nSauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open the Moran-\nnon, the black gate of his land.\nThe two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even\nfrom a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the\nblack guards upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate.

Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was\nheard: from the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden\nholds and outposts in the hills came answering calls; and further still,\nremote but deep and ominous, there echoed in the hollow land\nbeyond the mighty horns and drums of Barad-du\u02c6r. Another dreadful\nday of fear and toil had come to Mordor; and the night-guards were\nsummoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the day-guards,\nevil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts.

Or go away,\ngo to nice places, and give it back to little Sme\u00b4agol. Yes, yes, master"}
{"662": "\u2018I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore I\nshall go,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018If there is only one way, then I must take it.\nWhat comes after must come.\u2019\nSam said nothing. The look on Frodo\u2019s face was enough for him;\nhe knew that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any\nreal hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit\nhe had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now\nthey were come to the bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all\nthe way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still\nstick to him. His master would not go to Mordor alone. Sam would\ngo with him \u2013 and at any rate they would get rid of Gollum.\nGollum, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet. He knelt\nat Frodo\u2019s feet, wringing his hands and squeaking. \u2018Not this way,\nmaster!\u2019 he pleaded. \u2018There is another way. O yes indeed there is.\nAnother way, darker, more difficult to find, more secret. But Sme\u00b4agol\nknows it. Let Sme\u00b4agol show you!\u2019\n\u2018Another way!\u2019 said Frodo doubtfully, looking down at Gollum\nwith searching eyes.\n\u2018Yess! Yess indeed! There was another way. Sme\u00b4agol found it.\nLet\u2019s go and see if it\u2019s still there!\u2019\n\u2018You have not spoken of this before.\u2019\n\u2018No. Master did not ask. Master did not say what he meant to do.\nHe does not tell poor Sme\u00b4agol. He says: Sme\u00b4agol, take me to the\nGate \u2013 and then good-bye! Sme\u00b4agol can run away and be good. But\nnow he says: I purpose to enter Mordor this way. So Sme\u00b4agol is very\nafraid. He does not want to lose nice master. And he promised,\nmaster made him promise, to save the Precious. But master is going\nto take it to Him, straight to the Black Hand, if master will go this\nway. So Sme\u00b4agol must save them both, and he thinks of another way\nthat there was, once upon a time. Nice master. Sme\u00b4agol very good,\nalways helps.\u2019\nSam frowned. If he could have bored holes in Gollum with his\neyes, he would have done. His mind was full of doubt. To all appear-\nances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo.\nBut Sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe\nthat the long submerged Sme\u00b4agol had come out on top: that voice\nat any rate had not had the last word in the debate. Sam\u2019s guess was\nthat the Sme\u00b4agol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he\ncalled Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance:\nneitherwantedtheEnemytogettheRing;bothwishedtokeepFrodo"}
{"663": "Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted.\n\u2018And it\u2019s a good thing neither half of the old villain don\u2019t know\nwhat master means to do,\u2019 he thought. \u2018If he knew that Mr. Frodo\nis trying to put an end to his Precious for good and all, there\u2019d be\ntrouble pretty quick, I bet. Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of\nthe Enemy \u2013 and he\u2019s under orders of some kind from him, or was\n\u2013 that he\u2019d give us away rather than be caught helping us; and rather\nthan let his Precious be melted, maybe. At least that\u2019s my idea. And\nI hope the master will think it out carefully. He\u2019s as wise as any, but\nhe\u2019s soft-hearted, that\u2019s what he is. It\u2019s beyond any Gamgee to guess\nwhat he\u2019ll do next.\u2019\nFrodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were\npassing through Sam\u2019s slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out\ntowards the dark cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they\nhad taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little\nheight above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer\nbuttresses of the mountain-wall. In the midst of the valley stood the\nblack foundations of the western watch-tower. By morning-light the\nroads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could now be clearly\nseen, pale and dusty; one winding back northwards; another dwin-\ndling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui;\nand a third that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower,\nit entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where\nhe stood. Westward, to his right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of\nthe mountains, and went off southwards into the deep shadows that\nmantled all the western sides of Ephel Du\u00b4ath; beyond his sight it\njourneyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and the\nGreat River.\nAs he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and\nmovement on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the\nmarch, though for the most part they were hidden by the reeks and\nfumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond. But here and there\nhe caught the gleam of spears and helmets; and over the levels beside\nthe roads horsemen could be seen riding in many companies. He\nremembered his vision from afar upon Amon Hen, so few days before,\nthough now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope\nthat had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The\ntrumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no\nassault upon the Dark Lord by the men of Gondor, risen like avenging\nghosts from the graves of valour long passed away. These were Men\nof other race, out of the wide Eastlands, gathering to the summons\noftheirOverlord;armiesthathadencampedbeforehisGatebynight"}
{"664": "light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his frail\ngrey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then\nhe turned to Gollum.\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol,\u2019 he said, \u2018I will trust you once more. Indeed it seems\nthat I must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you,\nwhere I least looked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long\npursued with evil purpose. So far you have deserved well of me and\nhave kept your promise truly. Truly, I say and mean,\u2019 he added with\na glance at Sam, \u2018for twice now we have been in your power, and\nyou have done no harm to us. Nor have you tried to take from me\nwhat you once sought. May the third time prove the best! But I warn\nyou, Sme\u00b4agol, you are in danger.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, yes, master!\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Dreadful danger! Sme\u00b4agol\u2019s\nbones shake to think of it, but he doesn\u2019t run away. He must help\nnice master.\u2019\n\u2018I did not mean the danger that we all share,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I mean\na danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call\nthe Precious. Remember that! It will hold you to it; but it will seek\na way to twist it to your own undoing. Already you are being twisted.\nYou revealed yourself to me just now, foolishly. Give it back to Sme\u00b4agol\nyou said. Do not say that again! Do not let that thought grow in you!\nYou will never get it back. But the desire of it may betray you to a\nbitter end. You will never get it back. In the last need, Sme\u00b4agol, I\nshould put on the Precious; and the Precious mastered you long ago.\nIf I, wearing it, were to command you, you would obey, even if it\nwere to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire. And\nsuch would be my command. So have a care, Sme\u00b4agol!\u2019\nSam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise:\nthere was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not\nknown before. It had always been a notion of his that the kindness\nof dear Mr. Frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a\nfair measure of blindness. Of course, he also firmly held the incompat-\nible belief that Mr. Frodo was the wisest person in the world (with\nthe possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and of Gandalf ). Gollum in\nhis own way, and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was\nmuch briefer, may have made a similar mistake, confusing kindness\nand blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. He\ngrovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice\nmaster.\nFrodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly.\n\u2018Come now, Gollum or Sme\u00b4agol if you wish, tell me of this other\nway, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to"}

After a while he grew a little calmer, and\nFrodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the road that\nturned west of Ephel Du\u00b4 ath, he would come in time to a crossing in\na circle of dark trees. On the right a road went down to Osgiliath\nand the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went on\nsouthwards.\n\u2018On, on, on,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018We never went that way, but they say\nit goes a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that is\nnever still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice\nbirds: but we never went there, alas no! we never had a chance.

What of\nthe third turning?\u2019\n\u2018O yes, O yes, there is a third way,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018That is the road\nto the left. At once it begins to climb up, up, winding and climbing\nback towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock,\nyou\u2019ll see it, suddenly you\u2019ll see it above you, and you\u2019ll want to\nhide.\u2019\n\u2018See it, see it?

O yes, there were many tales about the Tower of the Moon.\u2019\n\u2018That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built,\u2019\nsaid Frodo. \u2018It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, He has only four on the Black Hand, but they are enough,\u2019\nsaid Gollum shuddering. \u2018And He hated Isildur\u2019s city.\u2019\n\u2018What does he not hate?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But what has the Tower of\nthe Moon to do with us?\u2019"}
{"666": "conquered it long ago. It is a very terrible place now. Travellers shiver\nwhen they see it, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. But\nmaster will have to go that way. That is the only other way. For the\nmountains are lower there, and the old road goes up and up, until\nit reaches a dark pass at the top, and then it goes down, down, again\n\u2013 to Gorgoroth.\u2019 His voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered.\n\u2018But how will that help us?\u2019 asked Sam. \u2018Surely the Enemy knows\nall about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close\nas this? The tower isn\u2019t empty, is it?\u2019\n\u2018O no, not empty!\u2019 whispered Gollum. \u2018It seems empty, but it\nisn\u2019t, O no! Very dreadful things live there. Orcs, yes always Orcs;\nbut worse things, worse things live there too. The road climbs right\nunder the shadow of the walls and passes the gate.

The things inside know: the\nSilent Watchers.\u2019\n\u2018So that\u2019s your advice is it,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018that we should go another\nlong march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one,\nwhen we get there, if we ever do?\u2019\n\u2018No, no indeed,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Hobbits must see, must try to\nunderstand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round,\nbut it attends more to some places than to others. He can\u2019t see\neverything all at once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the\ncountry west of the Shadowy Mountains down to the River, and He\nholds the bridges now. He thinks no one can come to the Moontower\nwithout fighting big battle at the bridges, or getting lots of boats\nwhich they cannot hide and He will know about.\u2019\n\u2018You seem to know a lot about what He\u2019s doing and thinking,\u2019\nsaid Sam. \u2018Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing\nwith Orcs?\u2019\n\u2018Not nice hobbit, not sensible,\u2019 said Gollum, giving Sam an angry\nglance and turning to Frodo. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol has talked to Orcs, yes of\ncourse, before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked\nvery far. And what he says now many peoples are saying. It\u2019s here\nin the North that the big danger is for Him, and for us. He will come\nout of the Black Gate one day, one day soon. That is the only way\nbig armies can come. But away down west He is not afraid, and there\nare the Silent Watchers.\u2019\n\u2018Just so!\u2019 said Sam, not to be put off. \u2018And so we are to walk up\nand knock at their gate and ask if we\u2019re on the right road for Mordor?\nOr are they too silent to answer? It\u2019s not sense. We might as well do\nit here, and save ourselves a long tramp.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t make jokes about it,\u2019 hissed Gollum. \u2018It isn\u2019t funny, O no!"}

He found it. He knows it.\u2019\n\u2018What did you find?\u2019 asked Frodo.\nGollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. \u2018A\nlittle path leading up into the mountains; and then a stair, a narrow\nstair, O yes, very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then\u2019\n\u2013 his voice sank even lower \u2013 \u2018a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a\nlittle cleft, and a path high above the main pass.

Gollum muttered but did not\nreply.\n\u2018Is it not guarded?\u2019 asked Frodo sternly. \u2018And did you escape out\nof the darkness, Sme\u00b4agol?

I did escape, all\nby my poor self. Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I\nhave searched and searched, of course I have. But not for the Black\nOne.

But even if Gollum could be trusted on this point, Frodo did not\nforget the wiles of the Enemy. The \u2018escape\u2019 may have been allowed or\narranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case Gollum\nwas plainly keeping a good deal back.\n\u2018I ask you again,\u2019 he said: \u2018is not this secret way guarded?\u2019\nBut the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen mood.

Indeed\nGandalf \u2019s guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon,\nwhile the Dark Land was still very far away. How they should enter\nit at the last Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could not say. Into\nthe stronghold of the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he had\nonce ventured. But into Mordor, to the Mountain of Fire and to\nBarad-du\u02c6r, since the Dark Lord rose in power again, had he ever\njourneyed there? Frodo did not think so.

But he had taken it on himself in his own\nsitting-room in the far-off spring of another year, so remote now that\nit was like a chapter in a story of the world\u2019s youth, when the Trees\nof Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This was an evil choice. Which\nway should he choose? And if both led to terror and death, what\ngood lay in choice?\nThe day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow\nwhere they lay, so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence\nthat could be felt, as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all\nthe world about them. Above them was a dome of pale sky barred\nwith fleeting smoke, but it seemed high and far away, as if seen\nthrough great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought.\nNot even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the\nhobbits sitting there, under the weight of doom, silent, not moving,\nshrouded in their thin grey cloaks. For a moment he might have\npaused to consider Gollum, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground:\nthere perhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of Men, its\nragged garment still clinging to it, its long arms and legs almost\nbone-white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a peck."}

Maybe there ain\u2019t\nno such a beast.\u2019 He sighed.\n\u2018No, no oliphaunts,\u2019 said Gollum again. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol has not heard\nof them. He does not want to see them. He does not want them to\nbe. Sme\u00b4agol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer.\nSme\u00b4agol wants master to go. Nice master, won\u2019t he come with\nSme\u00b4agol?\u2019\nFrodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst of all his cares when\nSam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of Oliphaunt, and the laugh\nhad released him from hesitation. \u2018I wish we had a thousand oli-\nphaunts with Gandalf on a white one at their head,\u2019 he said. \u2018Then\nwe\u2019d break a way into this evil land, perhaps. But we\u2019ve not; just our\nown tired legs, that\u2019s all. Well, Sme\u00b4agol, the third turn may turn the\nbest. I will come with you.\u2019\n\u2018Good master, wise master, nice master!\u2019 cried Gollum in delight,\npatting Frodo\u2019s knees. \u2018Good master! Then rest now, nice hobbits,\nunder the shadow of the stones, close under the stones! Rest and lie\nquiet, till the Yellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft\nand quick as shadows we must be!\u2019"}
{"672": "Chapter 4\nOF HERBS AND\nSTEWED RABBIT\nFor the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into\nthe shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western\nrim of their dell grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then\nthey ate a little, and drank sparingly. Gollum ate nothing, but he\naccepted water gladly.\n\u2018Soon get more now,\u2019 he said, licking his lips. \u2018Good water runs\ndown in streams to the Great River, nice water in the lands we are\ngoing to. Sme\u00b4agol will get food there too, perhaps. He\u2019s very hungry,\nyes, gollum!\u2019 He set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly,\nand a pale green light came into his eyes.\nThe dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the\nwestward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken\ncountry on the borders of the road. The moon was now three nights\nfrom the full, but it did not climb over the mountains until nearly\nmidnight, and the early night was very dark. A single red light burned\nhigh up in the Towers of the Teeth, but otherwise no sign could be\nseen or heard of the sleepless watch on the Morannon.\nFor many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled,\nstumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take\nthe road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as\nthey could at a little distance. At last, when night was growing old\nand they were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest,\nthe eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had\nturned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were\nheading southwards.\nWith hearts strangely lightened they now rested again, but not for\nlong. They were not going quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning\nit was nearly thirty leagues from the Morannon to the Cross-roads\nabove Osgiliath, and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys.\nSo soon they struggled on once more, until the dawn began to spread\nslowly in the wide grey solitude. They had then walked almost eight\nleagues, and the hobbits could not have gone any further, even if\nthey had dared."}
{"673": "The growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and\nruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but\nnear at hand they could see the southward road, now bearing away\nfrom the black roots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it\nwere slopes covered with sombre trees like dark clouds, but all about\nthem lay a tumbled heathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel,\nand other shrubs that they did not know. Here and there they saw\nknots of tall pine-trees. The hearts of the hobbits rose again a little\nin spite of weariness: the air was fresh and fragrant, and it reminded\nthem of the uplands of the Northfarthing far away. It seemed good\nto be reprieved, to walk in a land that had only been for a few years\nunder the dominion of the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen wholly\ninto decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate\nthat was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy\nheights. They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shel-\nter from evil eyes while the light lasted.\nThe day passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted\nout the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were\nstill under the shadows of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath, and the sun was veiled.\nFrodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum\nor too tired to trouble about him; but Sam found it difficult to do\nmore than doze, even when Gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling\nand twitching in his secret dreams. Hunger, perhaps, more than\nmistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely\nmeal, \u2018something hot out of the pot\u2019.\nAs soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming\nnight, they started out again. In a little while Gollum led them down\non to the southward road; and after that they went on more quickly,\nthough the danger was greater. Their ears were strained for the\nsound of hoof or foot on the road ahead, or following them from\nbehind; but the night passed, and they heard no sound of walker or\nrider.\nThe road had been made in a long lost time, and for perhaps thirty\nmiles below the Morannon it had been newly repaired, but as it\nwent south the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of\nold could still be seen in its straight sure flight and level course: now\nand again it cut its way through hillside slopes, or leaped over a\nstream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring masonry; but at last all\nsigns of stonework faded, save for a broken pillar here and there,\npeering out of bushes at the side, or old paving-stones still lurking\namid weeds and moss. Heather and trees and bracken scrambled"}
{"674": "wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest\nway.\nSo they passed into the northern marches of that land that Men\nonce called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling\nstreams. The night became fine under star and round moon, and it\nseemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went\nforward; and from the blowing and muttering of Gollum it seemed\nthat he noticed it too, and did not relish it. At the first signs of day\nthey halted again. They had come to the end of a long cutting, deep,\nand sheer-sided in the middle, by which the road clove its way through\na stony ridge. Now they climbed up the westward bank and looked\nabroad.\nDay was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were\nnow much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was\nlost in the distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes\nran down into dim hazes far below. All about them were small woods\nof resinous trees, fir and cedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown\nin the Shire, with wide glades among them; and everywhere there\nwas a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs. The long journey\nfrom Rivendell had brought them far south of their own land, but\nnot until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the\nchange of clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds\npierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers\nwere opening in the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of\nGondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.\nSouth and west it looked towards the warm lower vales of Anduin,\nshielded from the east by the Ephel Du\u00b4ath and yet not under the\nmountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open\nto the southern airs and the moist winds from the Sea far away. Many\ngreat trees grew there, planted long ago, falling into untended age\namid a riot of careless descendants; and groves and thickets there\nwere of tamarisk and pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and\nthere were junipers and myrtles; and thymes that grew in bushes, or\nwith their woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the\nhidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers, or red,\nor pale green; and marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys, and many\nherbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots\nand rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops.\nPrimeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert-brakes; and\nasphodel and many lily-flowers nodded their half-opened heads in\nthe grass: deep green grass beside the pools, where falling streams"}
{"675": "As they walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet\nodours rose about them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hob-\nbits breathed deep, and suddenly Sam laughed, for heart\u2019s ease not\nfor jest. They followed a stream that went quickly down before them.\nPresently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell: it\nlay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin, the carven rim of\nwhich was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles;\niris-swords stood in ranks about it, and water-lily leaves floated on\nits dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and spilled\never softly out over a stony lip at the far end.\nHere they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling\nfreshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place; for\nthis land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the\nEnemy. They had not come very far from the road, and yet even in\nso short a space they had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer\nwounds made by the Orcs and other foul servants of the Dark Lord:\na pit of uncovered filth and refuse; trees hewn down wantonly and\nleft to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the Eye cut in rude\nstrokes on their bark.\nSam scrambling below the outfall of the lake, smelling and touch-\ning the unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of\nMordor, was reminded suddenly of their ever-present peril. He\nstumbled on a ring still scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he\nfound a pile of charred and broken bones and skulls. The swift growth\nof the wild with briar and eglantine and trailing clematis was already\ndrawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it\nwas not ancient. He hurried back to his companions, but he said\nnothing: the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed\nby Gollum.\n\u2018Let\u2019s find a place to lie up in,\u2019 he said. \u2018Not lower down. Higher\nup for me.\u2019\nA little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of\nlast year\u2019s fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees\nclimbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here\nthey decided to rest and pass the day, which already promised to be\nbright and warm. A good day for strolling on their way along the\ngroves and glades of Ithilien; but though Orcs may shun the sunlight,\nthere were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch;\nand other evil eyes were abroad: Sauron had many servants. Gollum,\nin any case, would not move under the Yellow Face. Soon it would\nlook over the dark ridges of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath, and he would faint"}
{"676": "Now that the despair of the impassable Gate was behind him, he did\nnot feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood\nbeyond the end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him\nto save the waybread of the Elves for worse times ahead. Six days or\nmore had passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply\nfor three weeks.\n\u2018If we reach the Fire in that time, we\u2019ll be lucky at this rate!\u2019 he\nthought. \u2018And we might be wanting to get back. We might!\u2019\nBesides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and\ndrinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a break-\nfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really\nwanted. An idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had\njust begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all\nfours through the fern.\n\u2018Hi! Gollum!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Where are you going? Hunting? Well,\nsee here, old noser, you don\u2019t like our food, and I\u2019d not be sorry for\na change myself. Your new motto\u2019s always ready to help. Could you\nfind anything fit for a hungry hobbit?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, perhaps, yes,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol always helps, if they\nasks \u2013 if they asks nicely.\u2019\n\u2018Right!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I does ask. And if that isn\u2019t nice enough, I\nbegs.\u2019\nGollum disappeared. He was away some time, and Frodo after a\nfew mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went\nto sleep. Sam looked at him. The early daylight was only just creeping\ndown into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master\u2019s face\nvery clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside\nhim. He was reminded suddenly of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in\nthe house of Elrond, after his deadly wound. Then as he had kept\nwatch Sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining\nfaintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger.\nFrodo\u2019s face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it\nlooked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years\nwas now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden,\nthough the identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee\nput it that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words\nuseless, and murmured: \u2018I love him. He\u2019s like that, and sometimes\nit shines through, somehow. But I love him, whether or no.\u2019\nGollum returned quietly and peered over Sam\u2019s shoulder. Looking\nat Frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. Sam\ncame to him a moment later and found him chewing something and"}
{"677": "\u2018Sme\u00b4agol always helps,\u2019 he said. \u2018He has brought rabbits, nice\nrabbits. But master has gone to sleep, and perhaps Sam wants to\nsleep. Doesn\u2019t want rabbits now? Sme\u00b4agol tries to help, but he can\u2019t\ncatch things all in a minute.\u2019\nSam, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At\nleast not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they\nbegin to learn the art before their letters (which many never reach);\nbut Sam was a good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had\ndone a good deal of the camp-cooking on their travels, when there\nwas a chance. He still hopefully carried some of his gear in his pack:\na small tinder-box, two small shallow pans, the smaller fitting into\nthe larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a short two-pronged fork\nand some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the bottom of the\npack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But he\nneeded a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while\nhe took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the\nrabbits. He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few\nminutes.\n\u2018Now, Gollum,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve another job for you. Go and fill\nthese pans with water, and bring \u2019em back!\u2019\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol will fetch water, yes,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018But what does the\nhobbit want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.\u2019\n\u2018Never you mind,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018If you can\u2019t guess, you\u2019ll soon find\nout. And the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you\u2019ll learn.\nDon\u2019t you damage one of my pans, or I\u2019ll carve you into mincemeat.\u2019\nWhile Gollum was away Sam took another look at Frodo. He was\nstill sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck most by the leanness\nof his face and hands. \u2018Too thin and drawn he is,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Not\nright for a hobbit. If I can get these coneys cooked, I\u2019m going to\nwake him up.\u2019\nSam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the\nbank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch\nof a cedar at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves\nat the foot of the bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow\nhole and laid his fuel in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon\nhad a small blaze going. It made little or no smoke but gave off an\naromatic scent. He was just stooping over his fire, shielding it and\nbuilding it up with heavier wood, when Gollum returned, carrying\nthe pans carefully and grumbling to himself.\nHe set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was\ndoing. He gave a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened\nand angry. \u2018Ach! Sss \u2013 no!\u2019 he cried. \u2018No! Silly hobbits, foolish, yes"}
{"678": "\u2018Not make the nassty red tongues,\u2019 hissed Gollum. \u2018Fire, fire! It\u2019s\ndangerous, yes it is. It burns, it kills. And it will bring enemies, yes\nit will.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Don\u2019t see why it should, if you don\u2019t\nput wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I\u2019m\ngoing to risk it, anyhow. I\u2019m going to stew these coneys.\u2019\n\u2018Stew the rabbits!\u2019 squealed Gollum in dismay. \u2018Spoil beautiful\nmeat Sme\u00b4agol saved for you, poor hungry Sme\u00b4agol! What for? What\nfor, silly hobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat\nthem, eat them!\u2019 He clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned\nand lying by the fire.\n\u2018Now, now!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes\nyou, and raw coney chokes me. If you give me a coney, the coney\u2019s\nmine, see, to cook, if I have a mind. And I have. You needn\u2019t watch\nme. Go and catch another and eat it as you fancy \u2013 somewhere private\nand out o\u2019 my sight. Then you won\u2019t see the fire, and I shan\u2019t see\nyou, and we\u2019ll both be the happier. I\u2019ll see the fire don\u2019t smoke, if\nthat\u2019s any comfort to you.\u2019\nGollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. Sam\nbusied himself with his pans. \u2018What a hobbit needs with coney,\u2019 he\nsaid to himself, \u2018is some herbs and roots, especially taters \u2013 not to\nmention bread. Herbs we can manage, seemingly.\u2019\n\u2018Gollum!\u2019 he called softly. \u2018Third time pays for all. I want some\nherbs.\u2019 Gollum\u2019s head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were\nneither helpful nor friendly. \u2018A few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage,\nwill do \u2013 before the water boils,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol is not pleased. And Sme\u00b4agol doesn\u2019t\nlike smelly leaves. He doesn\u2019t eat grasses or roots, no precious, not\ntill he\u2019s starving or very sick, poor Sme\u00b4agol.\u2019\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol\u2019ll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if\nhe don\u2019t do as he\u2019s asked,\u2019 growled Sam. \u2018Sam\u2019ll put his head in it,\nyes precious.

For a while Sam sat musing, and tending the fire till\nthe water boiled. The daylight grew and the air became warm; the\ndew faded off turf and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering\nin their pans with the bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the\ntime went by. He let them stew for close on an hour, testing them\nnow and again with his fork, and tasting the broth.\nWhen he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and\ncrept along to Frodo. Frodo half opened his eyes as Sam stood over\nhim, and then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unre-\ncoverable dream of peace.\n\u2018Hullo, Sam!\u2019 he said. \u2018Not resting? Is anything wrong? What is\nthe time?\u2019\n\u2018About a couple of hours after daybreak,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018and nigh on\nhalf past eight by Shire clocks, maybe. But nothing\u2019s wrong. Though\nit ain\u2019t quite what I\u2019d call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I\u2019ve\ngot a bit of a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo. Do you\ngood.

I haven\u2019t brought no bowls, nor nothing\nproper.\u2019\nFrodo yawned and stretched. \u2018You should have been resting, Sam,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018And lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. But I do\nfeel hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed?\u2019\n\u2018A present from Sme\u00b4agol,\u2019 said Sam: \u2018a brace o\u2019 young coneys;\nthough I fancy Gollum\u2019s regretting them now. But there\u2019s naught to\ngo with them but a few herbs.\u2019\nSam and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew\nfrom the pans, sharing the old fork and spoon. They allowed them-\nselves half a piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast.\n\u2018Wheew! Gollum!\u2019 Sam called and whistled softly. \u2018Come on! Still\ntime to change your mind. There\u2019s some left, if you want to try\nstewed coney.\u2019 There was no answer.\n\u2018Oh well, I suppose he\u2019s gone off to find something for himself.\nWe\u2019ll finish it,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018And then you must take some sleep,\u2019 said Frodo."}

As\nhe stood up to return, he looked back up the slope. At that moment\nhe saw the sun rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or\nwhatever it was, that lay ever to the east, and it sent its golden beams\ndown upon the trees and glades about him. Then he noticed a thin\nspiral of blue-grey smoke, plain to see as it caught the sunlight, rising\nfrom a thicket above him. With a shock he realized that this was the\nsmoke from his little cooking-fire, which he had neglected to put out.\n\u2018That won\u2019t do! Never thought it would show like that!\u2019 he mut-\ntered, and he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and listened.\nHad he heard a whistle or not? Or was it the call of some strange\nbird? If it was a whistle, it did not come from Frodo\u2019s direction.\nThere it went again from another place! Sam began to run as well\nas he could uphill.\nHe found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had\nkindled some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had\nset the turves smouldering. Hastily he stamped out what was left of\nthe fire, scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. Then\nhe crept back to Frodo.\n\u2018Did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer?\u2019 he\nasked. \u2018A few minutes back. I hope it was only a bird, but it didn\u2019t\nsound quite like that: more like somebody mimicking a bird-call, I\nthought. And I\u2019m afraid my bit of fire\u2019s been smoking.

Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their\nhands with broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their\nown height, and great quivers of long green-feathered arrows. All had\nswords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied\nhues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green\ngauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and\nmasked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and\nbright. At once Frodo thought of Boromir, for these Men were like\nhim in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech.\n\u2018We have not found what we sought,\u2019 said one. \u2018But what have\nwe found?\u2019\n\u2018Not Orcs,\u2019 said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he\nhad seized when he saw the glitter of Sting in Frodo\u2019s hand.\n\u2018Elves?\u2019 said a third, doubtfully.\n\u2018Nay!

They\ntook off their masks now and again to cool them, as the day-heat\ngrew, and Frodo saw that they were goodly men, pale-skinned, dark\nof hair, with grey eyes and faces sad and proud. They spoke together\nin soft voices, at first using the Common Speech, but after the manner\nof older days, and then changing to another language of their own.\nTo his amazement, as he listened Frodo became aware that it was\nthe elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he\nlooked at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be\nDu\u00b4nedain of the South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse.\nAfter a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious\nin answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, sol-\ndiers of Gondor, and they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they were\ndescended from folk who lived in Ithilien at one time, before it was\noverrun. From such men the Lord Denethor chose his forayers, who\ncrossed the Anduin secretly (how or where, they would not say) to\nharry the Orcs and other enemies that roamed between the Ephel\nDu\u00b4ath and the River.\n\u2018It is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of Anduin,\u2019 said\nMablung, \u2018and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new\nerrand on this journey: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse\nthem!\u2019\n\u2018Aye, curse the Southrons!\u2019 said Damrod. \u2018\u2019Tis said that there\nwere dealings of old between Gondor and the kingdoms of the Harad\nin the Far South; though there was never friendship. In those days\nour bounds were away south beyond the mouths of Anduin, and\nUmbar, the nearest of their realms, acknowledged our sway. But that\nis long since. \u2019Tis many lives of Men since any passed to or fro\nbetween us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy has been\namong them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him \u2013 they\nwere ever ready to His will \u2013 as have so many also in the East. I\ndoubt not that the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of\nMinas Tirith are doomed, so great is His strength and malice.\u2019\n\u2018But still we will not sit idle and let Him do all as He would,\u2019\nsaid Mablung. \u2018These cursed Southrons come now marching up the\nancient roads to swell the hosts of the Dark Tower. Yea, up the very\nroads that craft of Gondor made. And they go ever more heedlessly,\nwe learn, thinking that the power of their new master is great enough,\nso that the mere shadow of His hills will protect them.

Before long they had\nall passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared the South. The\nshadows shrank.\n\u2018I wonder where that dratted Gollum is?\u2019 thought Sam, as he\ncrawled back into deeper shade. \u2018He stands a fair chance of being\nspitted for an Orc, or of being roasted by the Yellow Face.

The guards stood alert and tense in the shadow\nof the trees. Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake\nfrom above, over the top of the slope. Sam thought that he heard\ncries and wild shouting also, but the sound was faint, as if it came\nout of some distant cave. Then presently the noise of fighting broke\nout near at hand, just above their hiding-place. He could hear plainly\nthe ringing grate of steel on steel, the clang of sword on iron cap,\nthe dull beat of blade on shield; men were yelling and screaming,\nand one clear loud voice was calling Gondor!

For\na moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running down\nthe slope some way off with green-clad warriors leaping after them,\nhewing them down as they fled. Arrows were thick in the air.

He was glad that he could not see the dead\nface. He wondered what the man\u2019s name was and where he came\nfrom; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had\nled him on the long march from his home; and if he would not really\nrather have stayed there in peace \u2013 all in a flash of thought which\nwas quickly driven from his mind. For just as Mablung stepped\ntowards the fallen body, there was a new noise. Great crying and\nshouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting. And\nthen a great thudding and bumping, like huge rams dinning on the\nground.\n\u2018Ware! Ware!\u2019 cried Damrod to his companion. \u2018May the Valar\nturn him aside! Mu\u02c6mak!

On he\ncame, straight towards the watchers, and then swerved aside in the\nnick of time, passing only a few yards away, rocking the ground\nbeneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like ears\nspread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to strike,\nhis small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound\nwith bands of gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of scarlet\nand gold flapped about him in wild tatters.

{"687": "Chapter 5\nTHE WINDOW ON THE WEST\nIt seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he\nawoke to find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back.\nHe had brought many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the\nforay were now gathered on the slope nearby, two or three hundred\nstrong. They sat in a wide semicircle, between the arms of which\nFaramir was seated on the ground, while Frodo stood before him. It\nlooked strangely like the trial of a prisoner.\nSam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to\nhim, and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he\ncould see and hear all that was going on. He watched and listened\nintently, ready to dash to his master\u2019s aid if needed. He could see\nFaramir\u2019s face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and command-\ning, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. Doubt was in\nthe grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo.\nSam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with\nFrodo\u2019s account of himself at several points: what part he had to play\nin the Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir;\nand where he was now going. In particular he returned often to\nIsildur\u2019s Bane. Plainly he saw that Frodo was concealing from him\nsome matter of great importance.\n\u2018But it was at the coming of the Halfling that Isildur\u2019s Bane should\nwaken, or so one must read the words,\u2019 he insisted. \u2018If then you\nare the Halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing,\nwhatever it may be, to the Council of which you speak, and there\nBoromir saw it. Do you deny it?\u2019\nFrodo made no answer. \u2018So!\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018I wish then to learn\nfrom you more of it; for what concerns Boromir concerns me. An\norc-arrow slew Isildur, so far as old tales tell. But orc-arrows are\nplenty, and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign of Doom\nby Boromir of Gondor. Had you this thing in keeping? It is hidden,\nyou say; but is not that because you choose to hide it?\u2019\n\u2018No, not because I choose,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018It does not belong\nto me. It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if\nany could claim it, it would be Aragorn son of Arathorn, whom I\nnamed, the leader of our Company from Moria to Rauros.\u2019\n\u2018Why so, and not Boromir, prince of the City that the sons of"}

Great tidings!\u2019 But Faramir\u2019s face was unmoved.\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 he said. \u2018But so great a claim will need to be established,\nand clear proofs will be required, should this Aragorn ever come to\nMinas Tirith. He had not come, nor any of your Company, when I\nset out six days ago.\u2019\n\u2018Boromir was satisfied of that claim,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Indeed, if\nBoromir were here, he would answer all your questions. And since\nhe was already at Rauros many days back, and intended then to go\nstraight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers\nthere. My part in the Company was known to him, as to all the\nothers, for it was appointed to me by Elrond of Imladris himself\nbefore the whole Council. On that errand I came into this country,\nbut it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those\nwho claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.\u2019\nFrodo\u2019s tone was proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of\nit; but it did not appease Faramir.\n\u2018So!\u2019 he said. \u2018You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back\nhome, and let you be. Boromir will tell all, when he comes. When\nhe comes, say you! Were you a friend of Boromir?\u2019\nVividly before Frodo\u2019s mind came the memory of Boromir\u2019s\nassault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir\u2019s eyes\nwatching him grew harder. \u2018Boromir was a valiant member of our\nCompany,\u2019 said Frodo at length. \u2018Yes, I was his friend, for my part.\u2019\nFaramir smiled grimly. \u2018Then you would grieve to learn that\nBoromir is dead?\u2019\n\u2018I would grieve indeed,\u2019 said Frodo. Then catching the look in\nFaramir\u2019s eyes, he faltered. \u2018Dead?\u2019 he said. \u2018Do you mean that he is\ndead, and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words,\nplaying with me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?\u2019\n\u2018I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,\u2019 said Faramir.\n\u2018How then did he die, and how do you know of it? Since you say\nthat none of the Company had reached the city when you left.\u2019\n\u2018As to the manner of his death, I had hoped that his friend and\ncompanion would tell me how it was.\u2019\n\u2018But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still\nfor all that I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.\u2019\n\u2018Many indeed,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018and treachery not the least.\u2019"}

There was some mur-\nmuring, but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on: the\nsight of their Captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a\nyoung hobbit, legs well apart, bristling with wrath, was one beyond\ntheir experience. \u2018See here!\u2019 he said. \u2018What are you driving at?

And on the third night after another and a stranger\nthing befell me.\n\u2018I sat at night by the waters of Anduin, in the grey dark under the\nyoung pale moon, watching the ever-moving stream; and the sad\nreeds were rustling. So do we ever watch the shores nigh Osgiliath,\nwhich our enemies now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our\nlands. But that night all the world slept at the midnight hour. Then\nI saw, or it seemed that I saw, a boat floating on the water, glimmering\ngrey, a small boat of a strange fashion with a high prow, and there\nwas none to row or steer it.\n\u2018An awe fell on me, for a pale light was round it. But I rose and\nwent to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for I was\ndrawn towards it. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its\npace, and floated slowly by within my hand\u2019s reach, yet I durst not\nhandle it. It waded deep, as if it were heavily burdened, and it seemed\nto me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost filled with clear\nwater, from which came the light; and lapped in the water a warrior\nlay asleep.\n\u2018A broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. It\nwas Boromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his\nbeloved face. One thing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I\nknew not: a fair belt, as it were of linked golden leaves, about his waist.\nBoromir! I cried. Where is thy horn? Whither goest thou? O Boromir! But\nhe was gone. The boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering\non into the night. Dreamlike it was, and yet no dream, for there was\nno waking. And I do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down\nthe River to the Sea.\u2019\n\u2018Alas!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018That was indeed Boromir as I knew him.

A vision it was that you saw, I\nthink, and no more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or\nwill be. Unless indeed it is some lying trick of the Enemy. I have\nseen the faces of fair warriors of old laid in sleep beneath the pools\nof the Dead Marshes, or seeming so by his foul arts.\u2019\n\u2018Nay, it was not so,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018For his works fill the heart\nwith loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.\u2019\n\u2018Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth?\u2019 asked Frodo.\n\u2018For no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from Tol\nBrandir; and Boromir purposed to go home across the Entwash and\nthe fields of Rohan. And yet how could any vessel ride the foam of\nthe great falls and not founder in the boiling pools, though laden\nwith water?\u2019\n\u2018I know not,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018But whence came the boat?\u2019\n\u2018From Lo\u00b4 rien,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018In three such boats we rowed down\nAnduin to the Falls. They also were of elven-work.\u2019\n\u2018You passed through the Hidden Land,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018but it seems\nthat you little understood its power. If Men have dealings with the\nMistress of Magic who dwells in the Golden Wood, then they may\nlook for strange things to follow. For it is perilous for mortal man to\nwalk out of the world of this Sun, and few of old came thence\nunchanged, \u2019tis said.\n\u2018Boromir, O Boromir!\u2019 he cried. \u2018What did she say to you, the Lady\nthat dies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why\nwent you ever to Laurelindo\u00b4renan, and came not by your own road, upon\nthe horses of Rohan riding home in the morning?\u2019\nThen turning again to Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more.\n\u2018To those questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo\nson of Drogo. But not here or now, maybe. But lest you still should\nthink my tale a vision, I will tell you this. The horn of Boromir at\nleast returned in truth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it\nwas cloven in two, as it were by axe or sword. The shards came\nseverally to shore: one was found among the reeds where watchers\nofGondorlay,northwardsbelowtheinfallsoftheEntwash;theother"}
{"692": "\u2018And now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the\nlap of Denethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you\ncan tell me nothing of the cleaving of the horn?\u2019\n\u2018No, I did not know of it,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But the day when you\nheard it blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we\nparted, when I and my servant left the Company. And now your tale\nfills me with dread. For if Boromir was then in peril and was slain,\nI must fear that all my companions perished too. And they were my\nkindred and my friends.\n\u2018Will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? I am\nweary, and full of grief, and afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to\nattempt, before I too am slain. And the more need of haste, if we\ntwo halflings are all that remain of our fellowship.\n\u2018Go back, Faramir, valiant Captain of Gondor, and defend your\ncity while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.\u2019\n\u2018For me there is no comfort in our speech together,\u2019 said Faramir;\n\u2018but you surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the\npeople of Lo\u00b4rien themselves came to him, who arrayed Boromir as\nfor a funeral? Not Orcs or servants of the Nameless. Some of your\nCompany, I guess, live still.\n\u2018But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no\nlonger. If hard days have made me any judge of Men\u2019s words and\nfaces, then I may make a guess at Halflings! Though,\u2019 and now he\nsmiled, \u2018there is something strange about you, Frodo, an Elvish air,\nmaybe. But more lies upon our words together than I thought at\nfirst. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith to answer there to\nDenethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now choose a course\nthat proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste what is to be\ndone. Yet we must move hence without more delay.\u2019\nHe sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men\nwho were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went\noff this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks\nand trees. Soon only Mablung and Damrod remained.\n\u2018Now you, Frodo and Samwise, will come with me and my guards,\u2019\nsaid Faramir. \u2018You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was\nyour purpose. It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely\nwatched after this affray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I\nthink, go far today in any case, for you are weary. And so are we.\nWe are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten\nmiles from here. The Orcs and spies of the Enemy have not found\nit yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even against many. There\nwe may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In the morning"}
{"693": "There was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request,\nor order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since\nthis foray of the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more\ndangerous than ever.\nThey set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and\nFaramir with Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the\npool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed\na long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that\nmarched ever downwards and westwards. While they walked, as\nswiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.\n\u2018I broke off our speech together,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018not only because\ntime pressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because\nwe were drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly\nbefore many men. It was for that reason that I turned rather to the\nmatter of my brother and let be Isildur\u2019s Bane. You were not wholly\nfrank with me, Frodo.\u2019\n\u2018I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018I do not blame you,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018You spoke with skill in a hard\nplace, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more\nfrom you than your words said. You were not friendly with Boromir,\nor you did not part in friendship. You, and Master Samwise, too, I\nguess have some grievance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly\navenge his death, yet I knew him well. Isildur\u2019s Bane \u2013 I would hazard\nthat Isildur\u2019s Bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in\nyour Company. Clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort, and\nsuch things do not breed peace among confederates, not if aught\nmay be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit near the mark?\u2019\n\u2018Near,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018but not in the gold. There was no contention\nin our Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we\nshould take from the Emyn Muil. But be that as it may, ancient tales\nteach us also the peril of rash words concerning such things as \u2013\nheirlooms.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone.\nHe wished this thing brought to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked\nfate that seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that\nwhich I long to know: what was in his heart and thought in his latest\nhours. Whether he erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well,\nachieving some good thing. His face was more beautiful even than\nin life.\n\u2018But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur\u2019s Bane. Forgive\nme! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for\nthought. We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough"}
{"694": "is still preserved of ancient lore among the Rulers of the city that is\nnot spread abroad. We of my house are not of the line of Elendil,\nthough the blood of Nu\u00b4 menor is in us. For we reckon back our line\nto Mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king\u2019s stead when he\nwent away to war. And that was King Ea\u00a8rnur, last of the line of\nAna\u00b4rion, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards\nhave governed the city since that day, though it was many generations\nof Men ago.\n\u2018And this I remember of Boromir as a boy, when we together\nlearned the tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always\nit displeased him that his father was not king. \u2018\u2018How many hundreds\nof years needs it to make a steward a king, if the king returns not?\u2019\u2019\nhe asked. \u2018\u2018Few years, maybe, in other places of less royalty,\u2019\u2019 my\nfather answered. \u2018\u2018In Gondor ten thousand years would not suffice.\u2019\u2019\nAlas! poor Boromir. Does that not tell you something of him?\u2019\n\u2018It does,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.\u2019\n\u2018I doubt it not,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018If he were satisfied of Aragorn\u2019s\nclaim, as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch had\nnot yet come. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become\nrivals in her wars.\n\u2018But I stray. We in the house of Denethor know much ancient\nlore by long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many\nthings preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments,\nyea, and on stone, and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers\ncharacters. Some none can now read; and for the rest, few ever unlock\nthem. I can read a little in them, for I have had teaching. It was these\nrecords that brought the Grey Pilgrim to us. I first saw him when I\nwas a child, and he has been twice or thrice since then.\u2019\n\u2018The Grey Pilgrim?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Had he a name?\u2019\n\u2018Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018and he\nwas content. Many are my names in many countries, he said. Mithrandir\namong the Elves, Tharku\u02c6n to the Dwarves; Olo\u00b4rin I was in my youth in\nthe West that is forgotten, in the South Inca\u00b4nus, in the North Gandalf;\nto the East I go not.\u2019\n\u2018Gandalf !\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I thought it was he. Gandalf the Grey,\ndearest of counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in\nMoria.\u2019\n\u2018Mithrandir was lost!\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018An evil fate seems to have\npursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one of so\ngreat wisdom, and of power \u2013 for many wonderful things he did\namong us \u2013 could perish, and so much lore be taken from the world.\nAre you sure of this, and that he did not just leave you and depart"}
{"695": "\u2018I see that there is some great tale of dread in this,\u2019 said Faramir,\n\u2018which perhaps you may tell me in the evening-time. This Mithrandir\nwas, I now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the\ndeeds that are done in our time. Had he been among us to consult\nconcerning the hard words of our dream, he could have made them\nclear to us without need of messenger. Yet, maybe, he would not\nhave done so, and the journey of Boromir was doomed. Mithrandir\nnever spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal his purposes.\nHe got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the secrets\nof our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach\n(and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us\nabove all else concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon\nDagorlad in the beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not\nname was overthrown. And he was eager for stories of Isildur, though\nof him we had less to tell; for nothing certain was ever known among\nus of his end.\u2019\nNow Faramir\u2019s voice sank to a whisper. \u2018But this much I learned,\nor guessed, and I have kept it ever secret in my heart since: that\nIsildur took somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he went\naway from Gondor, never to be seen among mortal men again. Here\nI thought was the answer to Mithrandir\u2019s questioning. But it seemed\nthen a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning.\nNor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among us,\ndid I think of Isildur\u2019s Bane as being this same thing. For Isildur was\nambushed and slain by orc-arrows, according to the only legend that\nwe knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more.\n\u2018What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom\nof power and peril it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by\nthe Dark Lord. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle, I can\nwell believe that Boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever\nanxious for the victory of Minas Tirith (and his own glory therein),\nmight desire such a thing and be allured by it. Alas that ever he went\non that errand! I should have been chosen by my father and the\nelders, but he put himself forward, as being the older and the hardier\n(both true), and he would not be stayed.\n\u2018But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the\nhighway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could\nsave her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and\nmy glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.\u2019\n\u2018Neither did the Council,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Nor do I. I would have\nnothing to do with such matters.\u2019\n\u2018For myself,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018I would see the White Tree in flower"}

Almost he yielded to the desire for help\nand counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so\nwise and fair, all that was in his mind. But something held him back.\nHis heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and Sam were indeed,\nas seemed likely, all that was now left of the Nine Walkers, then he\nwas in sole command of the secret of their errand. Better mistrust\nundeserved than rash words. And the memory of Boromir, of the\ndreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in him, was\nvery present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to\nhis voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.\nThey walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green\nshadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them\nmany birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark\nleaves in the evergreen woods of Ithilien.\nSam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened;\nand at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to\nall the soft woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted,\nthat in all the talk the name of Gollum had not once come up. He\nwas glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would\nnever hear it again. He soon became aware also that though they\nwalked alone, there were many men close at hand: not only Damrod\nand Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on\neither side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place.\nOnce, looking suddenly back, as if some prickle of the skin told\nhim that he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a brief\nglimpse of a small dark shape slipping behind a tree-trunk. He opened\nhis mouth to speak and shut it again. \u2018I\u2019m not sure of it,\u2019 he said to\nhimself, \u2018and why should I remind them of the old villain, if they"}
{"697": "So they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land\nbegan to fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the right,\nand came quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same\nstream that trickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to\na swift torrent, leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed,\noverhung with ilex and dark box-woods. Looking west they could\nsee, below them in a haze of light, lowlands and broad meads, and\nglinting far off in the westering sun the wide waters of the Anduin.\n\u2018Here, alas! I must do you a discourtesy,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018I hope\nyou will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way\nto courtesy as not to slay you or to bind you. But it is a command\nthat no stranger, not even one of Rohan that fights with us, shall see\nthe path we now go with open eyes. I must blindfold you.\u2019\n\u2018As you will,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Even the Elves do likewise at need, and\nblindfolded we crossed the borders of fair Lothlo\u00b4rien. Gimli the dwarf\ntook it ill, but the hobbits endured it.\u2019\n\u2018It is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018But\nI am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.\u2019\nHe called softly and immediately Mablung and Damrod stepped\nout of the trees and came back to him. \u2018Blindfold these guests,\u2019 said\nFaramir. \u2018Securely, but not so as to discomfort them. Do not tie their\nhands. They will give their word not to try and see. I could trust\nthem to shut their eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if\nthe feet stumble. Lead them so that they do not falter.\u2019\nWith green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits\u2019\neyes, and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly\nthey took each one by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo\nand Sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guess-\ning in the dark. After a little they found that they were on a path\ndescending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single\nfile, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them\nfrom behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. Now and\nagain they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for\na while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the running\nwater was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At\nlength they were halted. Quickly Mablung and Damrod turned them\nabout, several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed\nupwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had\nbecome faint. Then they were picked up and carried down, down\nmany steps, and round a corner. Suddenly they heard the water again,\nloud now, rushing and splashing. All round them it seemed, and they\nfelt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. At last they were set on"}
{"698": "Then came the voice of Faramir close behind. \u2018Let them see!\u2019 he\nsaid. The scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and\nthey blinked and gasped.\nThey stood on a wet floor of polished stone, the doorstep, as it\nwere, of a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But\nin front a thin veil of water was hung, so near that Frodo could have\nput an outstretched arm into it. It faced westward. The level shafts\nof the setting sun behind beat upon it, and the red light was broken\ninto many flickering beams of ever-changing colour. It was as if they\nstood at the window of some elven-tower, curtained with threaded\njewels of silver and gold, and ruby, sapphire and amethyst, all kindled\nwith an unconsuming fire.\n\u2018At least by good chance we came at the right hour to reward you\nfor your patience,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018This is the Window of the Sunset,\nHenneth Annu\u02c6n, fairest of all the falls of Ithilien, land of many foun-\ntains. Few strangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall\nbehind to match it. Enter now and see!\u2019\nEven as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing\nwater. They turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At\nonce they found themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with\nan uneven stooping roof. A few torches were kindled and cast a dim\nlight on the glistening walls. Many men were already there. Others\nwere still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door\non one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits\nsaw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled\nwith great store of arms and victuals.\n\u2018Well, here is our refuge,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018Not a place of great ease,\nbut here you may pass the night in peace. It is dry at least, and there\nis food, though no fire. At one time the water flowed down through\nthis cave and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up\nthe gorge, by workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of\ndoubled height over the rocks far above. All the ways into this grot\nwere then sealed against the entry of water or aught else, all save\none. There are now but two ways out: that passage yonder by which\nyou entered blindfold, and through the Window-curtain into a deep\nbowl filled with knives of stone. Now rest a while, until the evening\nmeal is set.\u2019\nThe hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on,\nif they wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave,\nquietly and in orderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the"}
{"699": "platters, bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box-wood,\nsmooth and clean. Here and there was a cup or basin of polished\nbronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the Captain\u2019s seat in\nthe middle of the inmost table.\nFaramir went about among the men, questioning each as he came\nin, in a soft voice. Some came back from the pursuit of the Southrons;\nothers, left behind as scouts near the road, came in latest. All the\nSouthrons had been accounted for, save only the great mu\u02c6 mak: what\nhappened to him none could say. Of the enemy no movement could\nbe seen; not even an orc-spy was abroad.\n\u2018You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?\u2019 Faramir asked of the latest\ncomer.\n\u2018Well, no, lord,\u2019 said the man. \u2018No Orc at least. But I saw, or\nthought I saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk,\nwhen the eyes make things greater than they should be. So perhaps\nit may have been no more than a squirrel.\u2019 Sam pricked up his ears\nat this. \u2018Yet if so, it was a black squirrel, and I saw no tail. \u2019Twas\nlike a shadow on the ground, and it whisked behind a tree-trunk\nwhen I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could.\nYou will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, and it seemed\nno more, so I tried no arrow. It was too dark for sure shooting anyway,\nand the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling.\nBut I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I hastened\nback. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I\nturned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of\nthe Unnamed some of the beasts of Mirkwood are wandering hither\nto our woods. They have black squirrels there, \u2019tis said.\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018But that would be an ill omen, if it were\nso. We do not want the escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.\u2019 Sam fancied\nthat he gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but Sam\nsaid nothing. For a while he and Frodo lay back and watched the\ntorchlight, and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices.\nThen suddenly Frodo fell asleep.\nSam struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. \u2018He may be\nall right,\u2019 he thought, \u2018and then he may not. Fair speech may hide a\nfoul heart.\u2019 He yawned. \u2018I could sleep for a week, and I\u2019d be better for\nit. And what can I do, if I do keep awake, me all alone, and all these\ngreat Men about? Nothing, Sam Gamgee; but you\u2019ve got to keep\nawake all the same.\u2019 And somehow he managed it. The light faded\nfrom the cave door, and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and\nwas lost in gathering shadow.

It is time to eat.\u2019\nFrodo sat up and yawned and stretched. Sam, not used to being\nwaited on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed,\nholding a basin of water before him.\n\u2018Put it on the ground, master, if you please!\u2019 he said. \u2018Easier for\nme and you.\u2019 Then to the astonishment and amusement of the Men\nhe plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and\nears.\n\u2018Is it the custom in your land to wash the head before supper?\u2019\nsaid the man who waited on the hobbits.\n\u2018No, before breakfast,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But if you\u2019re short of sleep cold\nwater on the neck\u2019s like rain on a wilted lettuce. There! Now I can\nkeep awake long enough to eat a bit.\u2019\nThey were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels covered with\npelts and high enough above the benches of the Men for their con-\nvenience. Before they ate, Faramir and all his men turned and faced\nwest in a moment of silence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that\nthey should do likewise.\n\u2018So we always do,\u2019 he said, as they sat down: \u2018we look towards\nNu\u00b4menor that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that\nwhich is beyond Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such\ncustom at meat?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. \u2018But if\nwe are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise\nand thank him.\u2019\n\u2018That we do also,\u2019 said Faramir.\nAfter so long journeying and camping, and days spent in the lonely\nwild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale\nyellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted\nmeats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and\nclean knives and plates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything\nthat was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping. The wine\ncoursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of\nheart as they had not done since they left the land of Lo\u00b4 rien.\nWhen all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of\nthe cave, partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were\nbrought there. A little earthenware lamp burned in a niche."}
{"701": "of blunting the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not\nknow. But it is not good to sleep too soon after meat, and that\nfollowing a fast. Let us talk a while. On your journey from Rivendell\nthere must have been many things to tell. And you, too, would per-\nhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are.\nTell me of Boromir my brother, and of old Mithrandir, and of the\nfair people of Lothlo\u00b4 rien.\u2019\nFrodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though\nthe food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his\ncaution. Sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo\nspoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to\nmake an exclamation of agreement.\nFrodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from\nthe quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on\nthe valiant part Boromir had played in all their adventures, with the\nwolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines\nof Moria where Gandalf fell. Faramir was most moved by the story\nof the fight on the bridge.\n\u2018It must have irked Boromir to run from Orcs,\u2019 he said, \u2018or even\nfrom the fell thing you name, the Balrog \u2013 even though he was the\nlast to leave.\u2019\n\u2018He was the last,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018but Aragorn was forced to lead us.\nHe alone knew the way after Gandalf \u2019s fall. But had there not been\nus lesser folk to care for, I do not think that either he or Boromir\nwould have fled.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe, it would have been better had Boromir fallen there with\nMithrandir,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018and not gone on to the fate that waited\nabove the falls of Rauros.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe. But tell me now of your own fortunes,\u2019 said Frodo, turn-\ning the matter aside once again. \u2018For I would learn more of Minas\nIthil and Osgiliath, and Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What hope\nhave you for that city in your long war?\u2019\n\u2018What hope have we?\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018It is long since we had any\nhope. The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but\nI do not think that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless\nother help unlooked-for also comes, from Elves or Men. For the\nEnemy increases and we decrease. We are a failing people, a springless\nautumn.\n\u2018The Men of Nu\u00b4menor were settled far and wide on the shores\nand seaward regions of the Great Lands, but for the most part they\nfell into evils and follies. Many became enamoured of the Darkness\nandtheblackarts;someweregivenoverwhollytoidlenessandease,"}
{"702": "\u2018It is not said that evil arts were ever practised in Gondor, or that\nthe Nameless One was ever named in honour there; and the old\nwisdom and beauty brought out of the West remained long in the\nrealm of the sons of Elendil the Fair, and they linger there still. Yet\neven so it was Gondor that brought about its own decay, falling by\ndegrees into dotage, and thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who\nwas only banished not destroyed.\n\u2018Death was ever present, because the Nu\u00b4meno\u00b4 reans still, as they\nhad in their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life\nunchanging. Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the\nliving, and counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer\nthan the names of sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on\nheraldry; in secret chambers withered men compounded strong\nelixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the stars. And the\nlast king of the line of Ana\u00b4rion had no heir.\n\u2018But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. Wiser, for they\nrecruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea-\ncoast, and from the hardy mountaineers of Ered Nimrais. And they\nmade a truce with the proud peoples of the North, who often had\nassailed us, men of fierce valour, but our kin from afar off, unlike\nthe wild Easterlings or the cruel Haradrim.\n\u2018So it came to pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward (and\nmy father is the six and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at\nthe great Field of Celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had\nseized our northern provinces. These are the Rohirrim, as we name\nthem, masters of horses, and we ceded to them the fields of Calenard-\nhon that are since called Rohan; for that province had long been\nsparsely peopled. And they became our allies, and have ever proved\ntrue to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our northern marches\nand the Gap of Rohan.\n\u2018Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and\ntheir lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold\nby the ways of their own fathers and to their own memories, and\nthey speak among themselves their own North tongue. And we love\nthem: tall men and fair women, valiant both alike, golden-haired,\nbright-eyed, and strong; they remind us of the youth of Men, as they\nwere in the Elder Days. Indeed it is said by our lore-masters that\nthey have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from\nthose same Three Houses of Men as were the Nu\u00b4meno\u00b4 reans in their\nbeginning; not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the Elf-friend, maybe,\nyet from such of his people as went not over Sea into the West,\nrefusing the call."}
{"703": "Men of the Twilight, such as are the Rohirrim and their kin that\ndwell still far in the North; and the Wild, the Men of Darkness.\n\u2018Yet now, if the Rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to\nus, enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like\nto them, and can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are\nbecome Middle Men, of the Twilight, but with memory of other\nthings. For as the Rohirrim do, we now love war and valour as things\ngood in themselves, both a sport and an end; and though we still\nhold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only\nthe craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, nonetheless,\nabove men of other crafts. Such is the need of our days. So even was\nmy brother, Boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted\nthe best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of\nMinas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into\nbattle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.\u2019 Faramir sighed\nand fell silent for a while.\n\u2018You don\u2019t say much in all your tales about the Elves, sir,\u2019 said\nSam, suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that Faramir\nseemed to refer to Elves with reverence, and this even more than his\ncourtesy, and his food and wine, had won Sam\u2019s respect and quieted\nhis suspicions.\n\u2018No indeed, Master Samwise,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018for I am not learned\nin Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we\nhave changed, declining from Nu\u00b4menor to Middle-earth. For as you\nmay know, if Mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken\nwith Elrond, the Edain, the Fathers of the Nu\u00b4meno\u00b4 reans, fought\nbeside the Elves in the first wars, and were rewarded by the gift of\nthe kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of Elvenhome. But\nin Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days of\ndarkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time\nin which each kind walked further down their sundered roads. Men\nnow fear and misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And\nwe of Gondor grow like other Men, like the men of Rohan; for even\nthey, who are foes of the Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of\nthe Golden Wood with dread.\n\u2018Yet there are among us still some who have dealings with the\nElves when they may, and ever and anon one will go in secret to\nLo\u00b4 rien, seldom to return. Not I. For I deem it perilous now for mortal\nman wilfully to seek out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have\nspoken with the White Lady.\u2019\n\u2018The Lady of Lo\u00b4rien! Galadriel!\u2019 cried Sam. \u2018You should see her,"}
{"704": "\u2013 not at making it: a bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps, now and again,\nyou know, but not real poetry \u2013 so I can\u2019t tell you what I mean. It\nought to be sung. You\u2019d have to get Strider, Aragorn that is, or old\nMr. Bilbo, for that. But I wish I could make a song about her.\nBeautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great tree in flower,\nsometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like. Hard\nas di\u2019monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost in\nthe stars. Proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any\nlass I ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. But that\u2019s a lot\no\u2019 nonsense, and all wide of my mark.\u2019\n\u2018Then she must be lovely indeed,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018Perilously fair.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know about perilous,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It strikes me that folk\ntakes their peril with them into Lo\u00b4 rien, and finds it there because\nthey\u2019ve brought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because\nshe\u2019s so strong in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on\nher, like a ship on a rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a river.\nBut neither rock nor river would be to blame. Now Boro\u2014\u2014\u2019 He\nstopped and went red in the face.\n\u2018Yes? Now Boromir you would say?\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018What would\nyou say? He took his peril with him?\u2019\n\u2018Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a fine man as your brother was,\nif I may say so. But you\u2019ve been warm on the scent all along. Now\nI watched Boromir and listened to him, from Rivendell all down the\nroad \u2013 looking after my master, as you\u2019ll understand, and not meaning\nany harm to Boromir \u2013 and it\u2019s my opinion that in Lo\u00b4rien he first\nsaw clearly what I guessed sooner: what he wanted. From the moment\nhe first saw it he wanted the Enemy\u2019s Ring!\u2019\n\u2018Sam!\u2019 cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen deep into his own\nthoughts for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.\n\u2018Save me!\u2019 said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet.\n\u2018There I go again! When ever you open your big mouth you put your\nfoot in it the Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear,\nO dear!\n\u2018Now look here, sir!\u2019 He turned, facing up to Faramir with all the\ncourage that he could muster. \u2018Don\u2019t you go taking advantage of my\nmaster because his servant\u2019s no better than a fool. You\u2019ve spoken\nvery handsome all along, put me off my guard, talking of Elves and\nall. But handsome is as handsome does we say. Now\u2019s a chance to show\nyour quality.\u2019\n\u2018So it seems,\u2019 said Faramir, slowly and very softly, with a strange\nsmile. \u2018So that is the answer to all the riddles! The One Ring that\nwas thought to have perished from the world. And Boromir tried to"}
{"705": "call, and the Ring of Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for\nFaramir, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality! Ha!\u2019 He stood up,\nvery tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting.\nFrodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side\nby side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts.\nThere was a silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and\nlooked towards them in wonder. But Faramir sat down again in his\nchair and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave\nagain.\n\u2018Alas for Boromir! It was too sore a trial!\u2019 he said. \u2018How you have\nincreased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country,\nbearing the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of\nHalflings. We are truth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast sel-\ndom, and then perform, or die in the attempt. Not if I found it on the\nhighway would I take it I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire\nthis thing, and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was\nwhen I spoke, still I should take those words as a vow, and be held\nby them.\n\u2018But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that\nthere are some perils from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And\nbe comforted, Samwise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it\nwas fated to be so. Your heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw\nclearer than your eyes. For strange though it may seem, it was safe\nto declare this to me. It may even help the master that you love. It\nshall turn to his good, if it is in my power. So be comforted. But do\nnot even name this thing again aloud. Once is enough.\u2019\nThe hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. Men\nturned back to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain\nhad had some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over.\n\u2018Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,\u2019 said Fara-\nmir. \u2018If you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others\u2019 asking,\nthen you have pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to\nkeep it hid and not to use it. You are a new people and a new world\nto me. Are all your kin of like sort? Your land must be a realm of\npeace and content, and there must gardeners be in high honour.\u2019\n\u2018Not all is well there,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018but certainly gardeners are\nhonoured.\u2019\n\u2018But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all\nthings under the Sun of this world. And you are far from home and\nwayworn. No more tonight. Sleep, both of you \u2013 in peace, if you\ncan. Fear not! I do not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of"}

In the\nmorning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us.\u2019\nFrodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed.\nNow a great weariness came down on him like a cloud. He could\ndissemble and resist no longer.\n\u2018I was going to find a way into Mordor,\u2019 he said faintly. \u2018I was\ngoing to Gorgoroth. I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the\nthing into the gulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall\never get there.\u2019\nFaramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then\nsuddenly he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried\nhim to the bed and laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once\nhe fell into a deep sleep.\nAnother bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for\na moment, then bowing very low: \u2018Good night, Captain, my lord,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018You took the chance, sir.\u2019\n\u2018Did I so?\u2019 said Faramir.\n\u2018Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.\u2019\nFaramir smiled. \u2018A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the\npraise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught\nin this to praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.\u2019\n\u2018Ah well, sir,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018you said my master had an Elvish air;\nand that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too,\nsir, that reminds me of, of \u2013 well, Gandalf, of wizards.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018Maybe you discern from far away the air\nof Nu\u00b4 menor.

For a second old\nfears seized him and he sat up and shrank away.\n\u2018There is nothing to fear,\u2019 said Faramir.\n\u2018Is it morning already?\u2019 said Frodo yawning.\n\u2018Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is\nsetting. Will you come and see it? Also there is a matter on which I\ndesire your counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you\ncome?\u2019\n\u2018I will,\u2019 said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm\nblanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of\nthe water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed\nFaramir.\nSam, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw first\nhis master\u2019s empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw two dark\nfigures, Frodo and a man, framed against the archway, which was\nnow filled with a pale white light. He hurried after them, past rows\nof men sleeping on mattresses along the wall. As he went by the\ncave-mouth he saw that the Curtain was now become a dazzling veil\nof silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight. But\nhe did not pause to admire it, and turning aside he followed his\nmaster through the narrow doorway in the wall of the cave.\nThey went first along a black passage, then up many wet steps,\nand so came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the\npale sky, gleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here\ntwo flights of steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high\nbank of the stream; the other turning away to the left. This they\nfollowed. It wound its way up like a turret-stair.\nAt last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about.\nThey were on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right,\neastwards, the torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then,\npouring down a steep race, it filled a smooth-hewn channel with a\ndark force of water flecked with foam, and curling and rushing almost\nat their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon their\nleft.

A black darkness loomed beyond,\nand in it glinted, here and there, cold, sharp, remote, white as the\nteeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of\nthe realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow.\nFor a while Frodo stood there on the high stone, and a shiver ran\nthrough him, wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the nightlands\nhis old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist.\nWhy was he brought here out of forgetful sleep?\nSam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not\nrefrain himself from muttering, for his master\u2019s ear alone as he\nthought: \u2018It\u2019s a fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the\nheart, not to mention the bones! What\u2019s going on?\u2019\nFaramir heard and answered. \u2018Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil,\nas he goes from Middle-earth, glances upon the white locks of old\nMindolluin. It is worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought\nyou to see \u2013 though as for you, Samwise, you were not brought, and\ndo but pay the penalty of your watchfulness. A draught of wine shall\namend it. Come, look now!\u2019\nHe stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge, and\nFrodo followed. Sam hung back. He already felt insecure enough on\nthis high wet platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below\nthem they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then\nswirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks, until they found\ntheir way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming\nand chattering, into calmer and more level reaches. The moonlight\nstill slanted down to the fall\u2019s foot and gleamed on the ripples of the\nbasin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near\nbank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just beyond\nthe boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the black water as neatly as\nan arrow or an edgewise stone.\nFaramir turned to the man at his side. \u2018Now what would you say\nthat it is, Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black king-\nfishers in the night-pools of Mirkwood?\u2019\n\u2018\u2019Tis not a bird, whatever else it be,\u2019 answered Anborn. \u2018It has\nfour limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows,\ntoo. What is it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our\nhidings? It seems we are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and\nI have posted other archers, nigh as good marksmen as myself, on\neither bank.

Why does he\nso?\u2019\n\u2018There are two answers, I think,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018For one thing, he\nknows little of Men, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden\nthat perhaps he does not know that Men are concealed here. For\nanother, I think he is allured here by a mastering desire, stronger\nthan his caution.\u2019\n\u2018He is lured here, you say?\u2019 said Faramir in a low voice. \u2018Can he,\ndoes he then know of your burden?\u2019\n\u2018Indeed yes.

A little black head appeared\nat the far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks.\nThere was a brief silver glint, and a swirl of tiny ripples. It swam to\nthe side, and then with marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed\nout of the water and up the bank. At once it sat down and began to\ngnaw at the small silver thing that glittered as it turned: the last rays\nof the moon were now falling behind the stony wall at the pool\u2019s end.\nFaramir laughed softly. \u2018Fish!\u2019 he said. \u2018It is a less perilous hunger.\nOr maybe not: fish from the pool of Henneth Annu\u02c6n may cost him\nall he has to give.\u2019\n\u2018Now I have him at the arrow-point,\u2019 said Anborn. \u2018Shall I not\nshoot, Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.\u2019\n\u2018Wait, Anborn,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018This is a harder matter than it\nseems. What have you to say now, Frodo?

And forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you\nmay not see them.\u2019\nFrodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way\nand to steady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and\nsmooth but slippery. He halted listening. At first he could hear no\nsound but the unceasing rush of the fall behind him. Then presently\nhe heard, not far ahead, a hissing murmur.\n\u2018Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last,\nyes. Now we can eat fish in peace. No, not in peace, precious. For\nPrecious is lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left\nus, gollum; and Precious is gone. Only poor Sme\u00b4agol all alone. No\nPrecious. Nasty Men, they\u2019ll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We\nhates them. Fissh, nice fissh. Makes us strong. Makes eyes bright,\nfingers tight, yes. Throttle them, precious.

They would\nprobably get close enough, while Gollum was gorging and off his\nguard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be rid of the miserable\nvoice for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now. The servant\nhas a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. They would\nhave foundered in the Dead Marshes but for Gollum.

Come,\nSme\u00b4agol!\u2019 There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath.\n\u2018Come, Sme\u00b4agol!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018We are in danger. Men will kill\nyou, if they find you here. Come quickly, if you wish to escape death.\nCome to Master!\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said the voice. \u2018Not nice Master. Leaves poor Sme\u00b4agol and\ngoes with new friends. Master can wait. Sme\u00b4agol hasn\u2019t finished.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s no time,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Bring fish with you. Come!\u2019\n\u2018No! Must finish fish.\u2019\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol!\u2019 said Frodo desperately. \u2018Precious will be angry. I shall\ntake Precious, and I shall say: make him swallow the bones and\nchoke. Never taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting!\u2019\nThere was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness Gollum came\ncrawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. He had a\nhalf-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close\nto Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. His pale eyes were\nshining. Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up.\n\u2018Nice Master!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Nice hobbit, come back to poor\nSme\u00b4agol. Good Sme\u00b4agol comes.

I will go with\nyou as I promised. I promise again. But not now. You are not safe\nyet. I will save you, but you must trust me.\u2019\n\u2018We must trust Master?\u2019 said Gollum doubtfully. \u2018Why? Why not\ngo at once? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is\nhe?\u2019\n\u2018Away up there,\u2019 said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. \u2018I am not\ngoing without him. We must go back to him.\u2019 His heart sank.

They went through\nthe opening behind the bushes, and back, down the stairs and pass-\nages, into the cave. Two or three torches had been lit. Men were\nstirring. Sam was there, and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle\nthat the men carried. \u2018Got him?\u2019 he said to Frodo.\n\u2018Yes. Well no, I didn\u2019t get him. He came to me, because he trusted\nme at first, I\u2019m afraid. I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it\nwill be all right; but I hate the whole business.\u2019\n\u2018So do I,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And nothing will ever be all right where that\npiece of misery is.\u2019\nA man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the\nrecess at the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in his chair,\nand the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He\nsigned to them to sit down on the stools beside him. \u2018Bring wine for\nthe guests,\u2019 he said. \u2018And bring the prisoner to me.\u2019\nThe wine was brought, and then Anborn came carrying Gollum."}

Nine Lords there were, and after the\nreturn of their Master, which they aided and prepared in secret, they\ngrew strong again.

Gollum ate nothing.\nThe sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and\nthe light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they\nwalked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. The\nbirds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb.\nDarkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of\nnight they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more\nfrom Henneth Annu\u02c6n. Frodo lay and slept away the night on the\ndeep mould beneath an ancient tree. Sam beside him was more\nuneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of Gollum,\nwho had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. Whether\nhe had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered rest-\nlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned\nwith the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions.\n\u2018Must get up, yes they must!\u2019 he said. \u2018Long ways to go still, south\nand east. Hobbits must make haste!\u2019\nThat day passed much as the day before had gone, except that\nthe silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be\nstifling under the trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. Gollum\noften paused, sniffing the air, and then he would mutter to himself\nand urge them to greater speed.\nAs the third stage of their day\u2019s march drew on and afternoon\nwaned, the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more\nscattered. Great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide\nglades with here and there among them hoary ash-trees, and giant\noaks just putting out their brown-green buds. About them lay long\nlaunds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones, white\nand blue, now folded for sleep; and there were acres populous with\nthe leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were\nthrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or bird, was\nto be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and they\nwalked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another."}
{"721": "snakes down a steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before\nthem. On its further side the woods gathered again, blue and grey\nunder the sullen evening, and marched on southwards. To the right\nthe Mountains of Gondor glowed, remote in the West, under a fire-\nflecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the towering walls of Mordor;\nand out of that darkness the long valley came, falling steeply in an\never-widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom ran a\nhurrying stream: Frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through\nthe silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding\ndown like a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of\nsunset touched. There it seemed to Frodo that he descried far off,\nfloating as it were on a shadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken\npinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark.\nHe turned to Gollum. \u2018Do you know where we are?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Yes, Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower\nof the Moon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the\nRiver. The ruined city, yes, very nasty place, full of enemies. We\nshouldn\u2019t have taken Men\u2019s advice. Hobbits have come a long way\nout of the path. Must go east now, away up there.\u2019 He waved his\nskinny arm towards the darkling mountains. \u2018And we can\u2019t use this\nroad. Oh no! Cruel peoples come this way, down from the Tower.\u2019\nFrodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving\non it now. It appeared lonely and forsaken, running down to empty\nruins in the mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things\nmight indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see. Frodo\nshuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling\ninto night, and the sound of the water seemed cold and cruel: the\nvoice of Morgulduin, the polluted stream that flowed from the Valley\nof the Wraiths.\n\u2018What shall we do?\u2019 he said. \u2018We have walked long and far. Shall\nwe look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden?\u2019\n\u2018No good hiding in the dark,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018It\u2019s in day that hobbits\nmust hide now, yes in day.\u2019\n\u2018Oh come!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018We must rest for a bit, even if we get up\nagain in the middle of the night. There\u2019ll still be hours of dark then,\ntime enough for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.\u2019\nGollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the\ntrees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the\nwood. He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and\nafter some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large\nholm-oak, whose thick branches springing together from the trunk\nmade a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell"}
{"722": "Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits did not\nshut their eyes.\nIt must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up:\nsuddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them.\nHe listened and sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before,\nhis usual method of discovering the time of night.\n\u2018Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?\u2019 he said. \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\n\u2018We aren\u2019t, and we haven\u2019t,\u2019 growled Sam. \u2018But we\u2019ll go if we\nmust.\u2019\nGollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all\nfours, and the hobbits followed more slowly.\nAs soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum lead-\ning, eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for\nthe night was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems\nof trees before they stumbled against them. The ground became more\nbroken and walking was more difficult, but Gollum seemed in no\nway troubled. He led them through thickets and wastes of brambles;\nsometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit, sometimes down\ninto black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but if ever they\nwent a little downward, always the further slope was longer and\nsteeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first halt they looked\nback, and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had\nleft behind, lying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the\ndark blank sky. There seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly\nout of the East, eating up the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking\nmoon escaped from the pursuing cloud, but it was ringed all about\nwith a sickly yellow glare.\nAt last Gollum turned to the hobbits. \u2018Day soon,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hobbits\nmust hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste!\u2019\nHe quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. Soon they\nbegan to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part\nit was covered with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and\nlow tough thorns, though here and there clearings opened, the scars\nof recent fires. The gorse-bushes became more frequent as they got\nnearer the top; very old and tall they were, gaunt and leggy below but\nthick above, and already putting out yellow flowers that glimmered in\nthe gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall were the spiny thickets\nthat the hobbits could walk upright under them, passing through\nlong dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould.\nOn the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march\nand crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns. Their"}

There they lay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and\npeering out through the holes in the covert they watched for the slow\ngrowth of day.\nBut no day came, only a dead brown twilight. In the East there\nwas a dull red glare under the lowering cloud: it was not the red of\ndawn. Across the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel\nDu\u00b4ath frowned at them, black and shapeless below where night lay\nthick and did not pass away, above with jagged tops and edges out-\nlined hard and menacing against the fiery glow. Away to their right\na great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark and black amid\nthe shadows, thrusting westward.\n\u2018Which way do we go from here?\u2019 asked Frodo. \u2018Is that the opening\nof \u2013 of the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass?\u2019\n\u2018Need we think about it yet?\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Surely we\u2019re not going\nto move any more today, if day it is?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps not, perhaps not,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018But we must go soon,\nto the Cross-roads. Yes, to the Cross-roads. That\u2019s the way over\nthere, yes, Master.\u2019\nThe red glare over Mordor died away. The twilight deepened as\ngreat vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and\nSam took a little food and then lay down, but Gollum was restless.\nHe would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and\nthen crawled about under the bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then\nsuddenly he disappeared.\n\u2018Off hunting, I suppose,\u2019 said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to\nsleep first, and he was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was\nback in the Bag End garden looking for something; but he had a\nheavy pack on his back, which made him stoop. It all seemed very\nweedy and rank somehow, and thorns and bracken were invading\nthe beds down near the bottom hedge.\n\u2018A job of work for me, I can see; but I\u2019m so tired,\u2019 he kept on\nsaying. Presently he remembered what he was looking for. \u2018My pipe!\u2019\nhe said, and with that he woke up.\n\u2018Silly!\u2019 he said to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered\nwhy he was lying down under the hedge. \u2018It\u2019s in your pack all the\ntime!\u2019 Then he realized, first that the pipe might be in his pack but\nhe had no leaf, and next that he was hundreds of miles from Bag\nEnd. He sat up. It seemed to be almost dark. Why had his master\nlet him sleep on out of turn, right on till evening?\n\u2018Haven\u2019tyouhadnosleep,Mr.Frodo?\u2019hesaid.\u2018What\u2019sthetime?"}
{"724": "lighter: darker and darker. As far as I can tell, it isn\u2019t midday yet,\nand you\u2019ve only slept for about three hours.\u2019\n\u2018I wonder what\u2019s up,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Is there a storm coming? If so\nit\u2019s going to be the worst there ever was. We shall wish we were down\na deep hole, not just stuck under a hedge.\u2019 He listened. \u2018What\u2019s that?\nThunder, or drums, or what is it?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It\u2019s been going on for a good while\nnow. Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems\nto be the heavy air throbbing in your ears.\u2019\nSam looked round. \u2018Where\u2019s Gollum?\u2019 he said. \u2018Hasn\u2019t he come\nback yet?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018There\u2019s not been a sign or sound of him.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I can\u2019t abide him,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018In fact, I\u2019ve never taken\nanything on a journey that I\u2019d have been less sorry to lose on the\nway. But it would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to\ngo and get lost now, just when we shall need him most \u2013 that is, if\nhe\u2019s ever going to be any use, which I doubt.\u2019\n\u2018You forget the Marshes,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I hope nothing has hap-\npened to him.\u2019\n\u2018And I hope he\u2019s up to no tricks. And anyway I hope he doesn\u2019t\nfall into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we shall\nsoon be in for trouble.\u2019\nAt that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again,\nlouder now and deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their\nfeet. \u2018I think we are in for trouble anyhow,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I\u2019m afraid\nour journey is drawing to an end.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Sam; \u2018but where there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope, as my gaffer\nused to say; and need of vittles, as he mostways used to add. You have\na bite, Mr. Frodo, and then a bit of sleep.\u2019\nThe afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Look-\ning out from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world,\nfading slowly into a featureless, colourless gloom. It felt stifling but\nnot warm. Frodo slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes\nmurmuring. Twice Sam thought he heard him speaking Gandalf \u2019s\nname. The time seemed to drag interminably. Suddenly Sam heard\na hiss behind him, and there was Gollum on all fours, peering at\nthem with gleaming eyes.\n\u2018Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Wake up!\nNo time to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to\nlose!\u2019\nSam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited."}
{"725": "\u2018Silly!\u2019 hissed Gollum. \u2018We\u2019re not in decent places. Time\u2019s running\nshort, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up,\nMaster, wake up!\u2019 He clawed at Frodo; and Frodo, startled out of\nsleep, sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm. Gollum tore himself\nloose and backed away.\n\u2018They mustn\u2019t be silly,\u2019 he hissed. \u2018We must go. No time to lose!\u2019\nAnd nothing more could they get out of him. Where he had been,\nand what he thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he\nwould not say. Sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it;\nbut Frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. He sighed,\nhoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathering\ndarkness.\nVery stealthily Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under\ncover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the\nground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that\neven a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the\nhobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor heard them, walking as\nwarily as the little people can. Without the crack of a twig or the\nrustle of a leaf they passed and vanished.\nFor about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed\nby the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only\nnow and again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-\nbeats in some hollow of the hills. Down from their hiding-place they\nwent, and then turning south they steered as straight a course as\nGollum could find across a long broken slope that leaned up towards\nthe mountains. Presently, not far ahead, looming up like a black wall,\nthey saw a belt of trees. As they drew nearer they became aware that\nthese were of vast size, very ancient it seemed, and still towering\nhigh, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as if tempest and\nlightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill them or\nto shake their fathomless roots.\n\u2018The Cross-roads, yes,\u2019 whispered Gollum, the first words that\nhad been spoken since they left their hiding-place. \u2018We must go that\nway.\u2019 Turning eastward now, he led them up the slope; and then\nsuddenly there it was before them: the Southward Road, winding its\nway about the outer feet of the mountains, until presently it plunged\ninto the great ring of trees.\n\u2018This is the only way,\u2019 whispered Gollum. \u2018No paths beyond the\nroad. No paths. We must go to the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be\nsilent!\u2019\nAs furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they"}

At length they reached the trees, and found that they\nstood in a great roofless ring, open in the middle to the sombre sky;\nand the spaces between their immense boles were like the great dark\narches of some ruined hall. In the very centre four ways met. Behind\nthem lay the road to the Morannon; before them it ran out again\nupon its long journey south; to their right the road from old Osgiliath\ncame climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into darkness:\nthe fourth way, the road they were to take.\nStanding there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware\nthat a light was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam\u2019s face beside him.\nTurning towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to\nOsgiliath running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down,\ndown, into the West. There, far away, beyond sad Gondor now\noverwhelmed in shade, the Sun was sinking, finding at last the hem\nof the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling in an ominous fire\ntowards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a huge sitting\nfigure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The\nyears had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was\ngone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone,\nrudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with\none large red eye in the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and\nmighty chair, and all about the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with\nthe foul symbols that the maggot-folk of Mordor used.\nSuddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king\u2019s\nhead: it was lying rolled away by the roadside. \u2018Look, Sam!\u2019 he cried,\nstartled into speech. \u2018Look! The king has got a crown again!\u2019\nThe eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about\nthe high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A\ntrailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself\nacross the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the\ncrevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.\n\u2018They cannot conquer for ever!\u2019 said Frodo. And then suddenly\nthe brief glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and as if\nat the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell."}
{"727": "Chapter 8\nTHE STAIRS OF CIRITH UNGOL\nGollum was tugging at Frodo\u2019s cloak and hissing with fear and\nimpatience. \u2018We must go,\u2019 he said. \u2018We mustn\u2019t stand here. Make\nhaste!\u2019\nReluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as\nhis guide led him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the\nring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains. This\nroad, too, ran straight for a while, but soon it began to bend away\nsouthwards, until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that\nthey had seen from the distance. Black and forbidding it loomed\nabove them, darker than the dark sky behind. Crawling under its\nshadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east again and\nbegan to climb steeply.\nFrodo and Sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer\nable to care greatly about their peril. Frodo\u2019s head was bowed; his\nburden was dragging him down again. As soon as the great Cross-\nroads had been passed, the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien,\nhad begun to grow once more. Now, feeling the way become steep\nbefore his feet, he looked wearily up; and then he saw it, even as\nGollum had said that he would: the city of the Ringwraiths. He\ncowered against the stony bank.\nA long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the\nmountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley\u2019s arms,\nhigh on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath, stood\nthe walls and tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and\nsky, but it was lit with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling\nthrough the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon,\nfair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon\nailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and\nblowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that\nilluminated nothing. In the walls and tower windows showed, like\ncountless black holes looking inward into emptiness; but the topmost\ncourse of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then another,\na huge ghostly head leering into the night. For a moment the three\ncompanions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes.\nGollum was the first to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently,\nbut he spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step"}
{"728": "So they came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming\nfaintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went\non, winding deviously up towards the city\u2019s gate: a black mouth\nopening in the outer circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on\neither bank, shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous\nthese were too, beautiful and yet horrible of shape, like the demented\nforms in an uneasy dream; and they gave forth a faint sickening\ncharnel-smell; an odour of rottenness filled the air. From mead to\nmead the bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its head, carven with\ncunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and loathsome.\nThe water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the vapour\nthat rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly\ncold. Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then\nsuddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he\nbegan to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his\nhead lolling from side to side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him.\nSam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell,\nright on the threshold of the bridge.\n\u2018Not that way! No, not that way!\u2019 whispered Gollum, but the\nbreath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a\nwhistle, and he cowered to the ground in terror.\n\u2018Hold up, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 muttered Sam in Frodo\u2019s ear. \u2018Come back!\nNot that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.\u2019\nFrodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away\nfrom the city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and\nhe fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road\ntowards its gate. At last with an effort he turned back, and as he did\nso, he felt the Ring resisting him, dragging at the chain about his\nneck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment\nto have been blinded. The darkness before him was impenetrable.\nGollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was\nalready vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his\nstumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far\nfrom the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall\nbeside the road. Through this they passed, and Sam saw that they\nwere on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road\ndid, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and\nwent dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the\nvalley.\nAlong this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see\nGollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon\nthemon.Thenhiseyesshonewithagreen-whitelight,reflectingthe"}

As they rose above the stench and vapours\nof the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads\nclearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked\nall night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy\ntide of water. At last they could go no further without a halt.\nFrodo stopped and sat down on a stone. They had now climbed\nup to the top of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was\na bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went\non, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the\nsheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it\ndisappeared into the blackness above.\n\u2018I must rest a while, Sam,\u2019 whispered Frodo. \u2018It\u2019s heavy on me,\nSam lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry it? Anyway I must\nrest before we venture on to that.\u2019 He pointed to the narrow way\nahead.\n\u2018Sssh! ssh!\u2019 hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. \u2018Sssh!\u2019 His\nfingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging at\nFrodo\u2019s sleeve, he pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not\nmove.\n\u2018Not yet,\u2019 he said, \u2018not yet.\u2019 Weariness and more than weariness\noppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind\nand body. \u2018I must rest,\u2019 he muttered.\nAt this Gollum\u2019s fear and agitation became so great that he spoke\nagain, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from un-\nseen listeners in the air. \u2018Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes\ncan see us. When they come to the bridge they will see us. Come\naway! Climb, climb! Come!\u2019\n\u2018Come, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018He\u2019s right again. We can\u2019t stay\nhere.\u2019\n\u2018All right,\u2019 said Frodo in a remote voice, as of one speaking half\nasleep. \u2018I will try.\u2019 Wearily he got to his feet.\nBut it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled\nbeneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before,\nrolled in the ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with searing\nsuddenness there came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern\nmountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowering clouds with\ncrimson. In that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it seemed\nunbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of stone and ridges like notched\nknives sprang out in staring black against the uprushing flame in"}
{"730": "forks of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the en-\ncircling hills into the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of\nthe city there came a cry. Mingled with harsh high voices as of birds\nof prey, and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and fear,\nthere came a rending screech, shivering, rising swiftly to a piercing\npitch beyond the range of hearing. The hobbits wheeled round\ntowards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon their\nears.\nAs the terrible cry ended, falling back through a long sickening\nwail to silence, Frodo slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley,\nnow almost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood,\nand its cavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming\nteeth, was gaping wide. And out of the gate an army came.\nAll that host was clad in sable, dark as the night. Against the wan\nwalls and the luminous pavement of the road Frodo could see them,\nsmall black figures in rank upon rank, marching swiftly and silently,\npassing outwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great\ncavalry of horsemen moving like ordered shadows, and at their head\nwas one greater than all the rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his\nhooded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered with a perilous\nlight. Now he was drawing near the bridge below, and Frodo\u2019s staring\neyes followed him, unable to wink or to withdraw. Surely there was\nthe Lord of the Nine Riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly\nhost to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king whose\ncold hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife.\nThe old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards\nFrodo\u2019s heart.\nEven as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him\nbound as with a spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right before the\nentrance of the bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There\nwas a pause, a dead silence. Maybe it was the Ring that called to the\nWraith-lord, and for a moment he was troubled, sensing some other\npower within his valley. This way and that turned the dark head\nhelmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the shadows with its unseen\neyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a snake, unable to\nmove. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever before, the\ncommand that he should put on the Ring. But great as the pressure\nwas, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the Ring\nwould only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the\npower to face the Morgul-king \u2013 not yet. There was no longer any\nanswer to that command in his own will, dismayed by terror though\nit was, and he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from"}
{"731": "it moved the hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck.\nThen his own will stirred; slowly it forced the hand back and set it\nto find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his breast. Cold and\nhard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of Galadriel, so long\ntreasured, and almost forgotten till that hour. As he touched it, for\na while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind. He\nsighed and bent his head.\nAt that moment the Wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and\nrode across the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe\nthe elven-hoods defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small\nenemy, being strengthened, had turned aside his thought. But he was\nin haste. Already the hour had struck, and at his great Master\u2019s\nbidding he must march with war into the West.\nSoon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding\nroad, and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So\ngreat an army had never issued from that vale since the days of\nIsildur\u2019s might; no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed\nthe fords of Anduin; and yet it was but one and not the greatest of\nthe hosts that Mordor now sent forth.\nFrodo stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to Faramir. \u2018The\nstorm has burst at last,\u2019 he thought. \u2018This great array of spears and\nswords is going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He\nguessed it, but did he know the hour? And who can now hold the\nfords when the King of the Nine Riders comes? And other armies\nwill come. I am too late. All is lost. I tarried on the way. All is lost.\nEven if my errand is performed, no one will ever know. There will\nbe no one I can tell. It will be in vain.\u2019 Overcome with weakness he\nwept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge.\nThen at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the\nShire, some sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were\nopening, he heard Sam\u2019s voice speaking. \u2018Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake\nup!\u2019 Had the voice added: \u2018Your breakfast is ready,\u2019 he would hardly\nhave been surprised. Certainly Sam was urgent. \u2018Wake up, Mr.\nFrodo! They\u2019re gone,\u2019 he said.\nThere was a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed.\nThe last rank of spears had vanished down the road. The tower still\ngrinned across the valley, but the light was fading in it. The whole\ncity was falling back into a dark brooding shade, and silence. Yet still\nit was filled with watchfulness.\n\u2018Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They\u2019re gone, and we\u2019d better go too.\nThere\u2019s something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a"}
{"732": "Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left\nhim, but the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling\nnow as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what\nhe had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir\nor Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever\nknew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in one hand\nand the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was\nalready welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and\nheld it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now\nno more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take\nthe upward road.\nGollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the dark-\nness beyond, when the gates of Minas Morgul opened, leaving the\nhobbits where they lay. He now came creeping back, his teeth\nchattering and his fingers snapping. \u2018Foolish! Silly!\u2019 he hissed. \u2018Make\nhaste! They mustn\u2019t think danger has passed. It hasn\u2019t. Make haste!\u2019\nThey did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing\nledge. It was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing\nso many other perils; but it did not last long. Soon the path reached\na rounded angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and\nthere it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock. They had\ncome to the first stair that Gollum had spoken of. The darkness was\nalmost complete, and they could see nothing much beyond their\nhands\u2019 stretch; but Gollum\u2019s eyes shone pale, several feet above, as\nhe turned back towards them.\n\u2018Careful!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful!\u2019\nCare was certainly needed. Frodo and Sam at first felt easier,\nhaving now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep\nas a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and\nmore aware of the long black fall behind them. And the steps were\nnarrow, spaced unevenly, and often treacherous: they were worn and\nsmooth at the edges, and some were broken, and some cracked as\nfoot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled on, until at last they\nwere clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead, and forcing\ntheir aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as the stair cut\nits way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher\nand higher above their heads.\nAt length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they\nsaw Gollum\u2019s eyes peering down at them again. \u2018We\u2019re up,\u2019 he whis-\npered. \u2018First stair\u2019s past. Clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever\nhobbits. Just a few more little steps and that\u2019s all, yes.\u2019"}
{"733": "in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though\nat a gentler slope and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest\nlong.\n\u2018There\u2019s another stair still,\u2019 he said. \u2018Much longer stair. Rest when\nwe get to the top of next stair. Not yet.\u2019\nSam groaned. \u2018Longer, did you say?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018Yes, yess, longer,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018But not so difficult. Hobbits\nhave climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.\u2019\n\u2018And what after that?\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018We shall see,\u2019 said Gollum softly. \u2018O yes, we shall see!\u2019\n\u2018I thought you said there was a tunnel,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Isn\u2019t there a\ntunnel or something to go through?\u2019\n\u2018O yes, there\u2019s a tunnel,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018But hobbits can rest before\nthey try that. If they get through that, they\u2019ll be nearly at the top.\nVery nearly, if they get through. O yes!\u2019\nFrodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now he felt\ncold and clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage,\nblowing down from the invisible heights above. He got up and shook\nhimself. \u2018Well, let\u2019s go on!\u2019 he said. \u2018This is no place to sit in.\u2019\nThe passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air\nflowed over them, rising as they went on to a bitter wind. The moun-\ntains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to\nturn them back from the secrets of the high places, or to blow them\naway into the darkness behind. They only knew that they had come\nto the end, when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand. They\ncould see very little. Great black shapeless masses and deep grey\nshadows loomed above them and about them, but now and again a\ndull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a\nmoment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side,\nlike pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have\nclimbed up many hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on\ntheir left and a chasm on their right.\nGollum led the way close under the cliff. For the present they\nwere no longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and\ndangerous in the dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen\nstone in the way. Their going was slow and cautious. How many\nhours had passed since they had entered the Morgul Vale neither\nSam nor Frodo could any longer guess. The night seemed endless.\nAt length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and\nonce more a stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and\nagain they began to climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this"}
{"734": "it. At one point it crawled sideways right to the edge of the dark\nchasm, and Frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit\nthe great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley. Down in its depths\nglimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the dead\ncity to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away.\nStill on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a\nfinal flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another\nlevel. The path had veered away from the main pass in the great\nravine, and it now followed its own perilous course at the bottom of\na lesser cleft among the higher regions of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath. Dimly\nthe hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on\neither side, between which were great crevices and fissures blacker\nthan the night, where forgotten winters had gnawed and carved the\nsunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed stronger;\nthough they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed\ncoming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame\nof some great violence of Sauron in the torment of Gorgoroth beyond.\nStill far ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he\nguessed, the very crown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness\nof the eastern sky a cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow,\ndeep-cloven between two black shoulders; and on either shoulder\nwas a horn of stone.\nHe paused and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left\nwas tall and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light\nin the land beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it was\na black tower poised above the outer pass. He touched Sam\u2019s arm\nand pointed.\n\u2018I don\u2019t like the look of that!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018So this secret way of\nyours is guarded after all,\u2019 he growled, turning to Gollum. \u2018As you\nknew all along, I suppose?\u2019\n\u2018All ways are watched, yes,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018Of course they are. But\nhobbits must try some way. This may be least watched. Perhaps\nthey\u2019ve all gone away to big battle, perhaps!\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 grunted Sam. \u2018Well, it still seems a long way off, and\na long way up before we get there. And there\u2019s still the tunnel. I\nthink you ought to rest now, Mr. Frodo. I don\u2019t know what time of\nday or night it is, but we\u2019ve kept going for hours and hours.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, we must rest,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Let us find some corner out of\nthe wind, and gather our strength \u2013 for the last lap.\u2019 For so he felt\nit to be. The terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be\ndone there, seemed remote, too far off yet to trouble him. All his"}
{"735": "errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark\nhour of weariness, still labouring in the stony shadows under Cirith\nUngol.\nIn a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down:\nFrodo and Sam a little way within, and Gollum crouched upon the\nground near the opening. There the hobbits took what they expected\nwould be their last meal before they went down into the Nameless\nLand, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. Some of\nthe food of Gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the Elves,\nand they drank a little. But of their water they were sparing and took\nonly enough to moisten their dry mouths.\n\u2018I wonder when we\u2019ll find water again?\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But I suppose\neven over there they drink? Orcs drink, don\u2019t they?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, they drink,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But do not let us speak of that.\nSuch drink is not for us.\u2019\n\u2018Then all the more need to fill our bottles,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But there\nisn\u2019t any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have I heard. And\nanyway Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.\u2019\n\u2018No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,\u2019 said\nFrodo. \u2018We are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring\nit would be flowing into it and not out of it.\u2019\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t trust it,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018not till I was dying of thirst. There\u2019s\na wicked feeling about this place.\u2019 He sniffed. \u2018And a smell, I fancy.\nDo you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don\u2019t like it.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t like anything here at all,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018step or stone, breath\nor bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is\nlaid.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, that\u2019s so,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And we shouldn\u2019t be here at all, if we\u2019d\nknown more about it before we started. But I suppose it\u2019s often\nthat way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo:\nadventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were\nthings the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for,\nbecause they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was\na bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that\u2019s not the way\nof it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the\nmind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually \u2013 their\npaths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of\nchances, like us, of turning back, only they didn\u2019t. And if they had,\nwe shouldn\u2019t know, because they\u2019d have been forgotten. We hear\nabout those as just went on \u2013 and not all to a good end, mind you;\nat least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good"}
{"736": "best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed\nin! I wonder what sort of a tale we\u2019ve fallen into?\u2019\n\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But I don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s the way of\na real tale. Take any one that you\u2019re fond of. You may know, or\nguess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the\npeople in it don\u2019t know. And you don\u2019t want them to.\u2019\n\u2018No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going\nto get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet\nhe did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours.\nBut that\u2019s a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and\ninto grief and beyond it \u2013 and the Silmaril went on and came to\nEa\u00a8rendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We\u2019ve got \u2013\nyou\u2019ve got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave\nyou! Why, to think of it, we\u2019re in the same tale still! It\u2019s going on.\nDon\u2019t the great tales never end?\u2019\n\u2018No, they never end as tales,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But the people in them\ncome, and go when their part\u2019s ended. Our part will end later \u2013 or\nsooner.\u2019\n\u2018And then we can have some rest and some sleep,\u2019 said Sam. He\nlaughed grimly. \u2018And I mean just that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain\nordinary rest, and sleep, and waking up to a morning\u2019s work in the\ngarden. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I\u2019m hoping for all the time. All the big\nimportant plans are not for my sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever\nbe put into songs or tales. We\u2019re in one, of course; but I mean: put\ninto words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big\nbook with red and black letters, years and years afterwards. And\npeople will say: \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s hear about Frodo and the Ring!\u2019\u2019 And they\u2019ll\nsay: \u2018\u2018Yes, that\u2019s one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave,\nwasn\u2019t he, dad?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and\nthat\u2019s saying a lot.\u2019\u2019 \u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s saying a lot too much,\u2019 said Frodo, and he laughed, a long\nclear laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in\nthose places since Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly\nit seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning\nover them. But Frodo did not heed them; he laughed again. \u2018Why,\nSam,\u2019 he said, \u2018to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the\nstory was already written. But you\u2019ve left out one of the chief charac-\nters: Samwise the stouthearted. \u2018\u2018I want to hear more about Sam,\ndad. Why didn\u2019t they put in more of his talk, dad? That\u2019s what I\nlike, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn\u2019t have got far without\nSam, would he, dad?\u2019\u2019 \u2019\n\u2018Now, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t make fun. I was"}
{"737": "fast. You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story,\nand it is all too likely that some will say at this point: \u2018\u2018Shut the book\nnow, dad; we don\u2019t want to read any more.\u2019\u2019 \u2019\n\u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018but I wouldn\u2019t be one to say that. Things\ndone and over and made into part of the great tales are different.\nWhy, even Gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have\nby you, anyway. And he used to like tales himself once, by his own\naccount. I wonder if he thinks he\u2019s the hero or the villain?\n\u2018Gollum!\u2019 he called. \u2018Would you like to be the hero \u2013 now where\u2019s\nhe got to again?\u2019\nThere was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the\nshadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual,\naccepted a mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up\nfor a sleep. They had supposed that one at any rate of his objects in\nhis long absence the day before had been to hunt for food to his own\nliking; and now he had evidently slipped off again while they talked.\nBut what for this time?\n\u2018I don\u2019t like his sneaking off without saying,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And least\nof all now. He can\u2019t be looking for food up here, not unless there\u2019s\nsome kind of rock he fancies. Why, there isn\u2019t even a bit of moss!\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s no good worrying about him now,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018We couldn\u2019t\nhave got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and\nso we\u2019ll have to put up with his ways. If he\u2019s false, he\u2019s false.\u2019\n\u2018All the same, I\u2019d rather have him under my eye,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018All\nthe more so, if he\u2019s false. Do you remember he never would say if\nthis pass was guarded or no? And now we see a tower there \u2013 and it\nmay be deserted, and it may not. Do you think he\u2019s gone to fetch\nthem, Orcs or whatever they are?\u2019\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 answered Frodo. \u2018Even if he\u2019s up to some\nwickedness, and I suppose that\u2019s not unlikely. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that:\nnot to fetch Orcs, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now,\nand go through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the\nland he fears? He could probably have betrayed us to Orcs many\ntimes since we met him. No, if it\u2019s anything, it will be some little\nprivate trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I suppose you\u2019re right, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Not that it\ncomforts me mightily. I don\u2019t make no mistake: I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019d\nhand me over to Orcs as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting\n\u2013 his Precious. No, I suppose the whole time it\u2019s been The Precious\nfor poor Sme\u00b4agol. That\u2019s the one idea in all his little schemes, if he\nhas any.

And in the other part, perhaps, he\u2019s just biding his time and\nwaiting on chance.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, Slinker and Stinker, as I\u2019ve said before,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But the\nnearer they get to the Enemy\u2019s land the more like Stinker Slinker\nwill get. Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won\u2019t let us\nreally take the precious thing over the border without making some\nkind of trouble.\u2019\n\u2018We haven\u2019t got there yet,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018No, but we\u2019d better keep our eyes skinned till we do. If we\u2019re\ncaught napping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but\nwhat it would be safe for you to have a wink now, master. Safe, if\nyou lay close to me.

Lay your head in my lap.\u2019\nAnd so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawl-\ning and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat\npropped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breath-\ning heavy. In his lap lay Frodo\u2019s head, drowned deep in sleep; upon\nhis white forehead lay one of Sam\u2019s brown hands, and the other lay\nsoftly upon his master\u2019s breast. Peace was in both their faces.\nGollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean\nhungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and\ngrey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he\nturned away, peering back up towards the pass, shaking his head, as\nif engaged in some interior debate. Then he came back, and slowly\nputting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched Frodo\u2019s\nknee \u2013 but almost the touch was a caress. For a fleeting moment,\ncould one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought\nthat they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had\ncarried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the\nfields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.\nBut at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep,\nand immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was\nGollum \u2013 \u2018pawing at master,\u2019 as he thought.\n\u2018Hey you!\u2019 he said roughly. \u2018What are you up to?\u2019\n\u2018Nothing, nothing,\u2019 said Gollum softly. \u2018Nice Master!\u2019"}
{"739": "Gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his\nheavy lids. Almost spider-like he looked now, crouched back on his\nbent limbs, with his protruding eyes.

Very nice friends, O yes my precious, very nice.\u2019\nSam felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. \u2018Sorry,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I shouldn\u2019t\nhave been sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. But Mr. Frodo,\nhe\u2019s that tired, I asked him to have a wink; and well, that\u2019s how it\nis. Sorry. But where have you been to?\u2019\n\u2018Sneaking,\u2019 said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his eyes.\n\u2018O very well,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018have it your own way! I don\u2019t suppose\nit\u2019s so far from the truth. And now we\u2019d better all be sneaking along\ntogether. What\u2019s the time? Is it today or tomorrow?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s tomorrow,\u2019 said Gollum, \u2018or this was tomorrow when hobbits\nwent to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous \u2013 if poor Sme\u00b4agol wasn\u2019t\nsneaking about to watch.\u2019\n\u2018I think we shall get tired of that word soon,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But never\nmind. I\u2019ll wake master up.\u2019 Gently he smoothed the hair back from\nFrodo\u2019s brow, and bending down spoke softly to him.\n\u2018Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up!\u2019\nFrodo stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing Sam\u2019s face\nbending over him. \u2018Calling me early aren\u2019t you, Sam?\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s\ndark still!\u2019\n\u2018Yes it\u2019s always dark here,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But Gollum\u2019s come back,\nMr. Frodo, and he says it\u2019s tomorrow. So we must be walking on.\nThe last lap.\u2019\nFrodo drew a deep breath and sat up. \u2018The last lap!\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Hullo, Sme\u00b4agol! Found any food? Have you had any rest?\u2019\n\u2018No food, no rest, nothing for Sme\u00b4agol,\u2019 said Gollum. \u2018He\u2019s a\nsneak.\u2019\nSam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself.\n\u2018Don\u2019t take names to yourself, Sme\u00b4agol,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It\u2019s unwise,\nwhether they are true or false.\u2019\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol has to take what\u2019s given him,\u2019 answered Gollum. \u2018He\nwas given that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows\nso much.\u2019\nFrodo looked at Sam. \u2018Yes sir,\u2019 he said. \u2018I did use the word, waking\nup out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. I said I"}

{"741": "Chapter 9\nSHELOB\u2019S LAIR\nIt may indeed have been daytime now, as Gollum said, but the\nhobbits could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky\nabove was less utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while\ninstead of the darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks\nand holes, a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about\nthem. They passed on, Gollum in front and the hobbits now side by\nside, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and\nweathered rock, standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand.\nThere was no sound. Some way ahead, a mile or so, perhaps, was a\ngreat grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain-stone.\nDarker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it\ntowered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay\nbeyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air.\n\u2018Ugh! That smell!\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s getting stronger and stronger.\u2019\nPresently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of\nit they saw the opening of a cave. \u2018This is the way in,\u2019 said Gollum\nsoftly. \u2018This is the entrance to the tunnel.\u2019 He did not speak its name:\nTorech Ungol, Shelob\u2019s Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly\nodour of decay in the meads of Morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth\nunnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.\n\u2018Is this the only way, Sme\u00b4agol?\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 he answered. \u2018Yes, we must go this way now.\u2019\n\u2018D\u2019you mean to say you\u2019ve been through this hole?\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018Phew! But perhaps you don\u2019t mind bad smells.\u2019\nGollum\u2019s eyes glinted. \u2018He doesn\u2019t know what we minds, does he,\nprecious? No, he doesn\u2019t. But Sme\u00b4agol can bear things. Yes. He\u2019s\nbeen through. O yes, right through. It\u2019s the only way.\u2019\n\u2018And what makes the smell, I wonder,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It\u2019s like \u2013 well,\nI wouldn\u2019t like to say. Some beastly hole of the Orcs, I\u2019ll warrant,\nwith a hundred years of their filth in it.\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018Orcs or no, if it\u2019s the only way, we must take\nit.\u2019\nDrawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were\nin utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of\nMoria had Frodo or Sam known such darkness, and if possible here"}

They walked as it were in a black vapour wrought\nof veritable darkness itself that, as it was breathed, brought blindness\nnot only to the eyes but to the mind, so that even the memory of\ncolours and of forms and of any light faded out of thought. Night\nalways had been, and always would be, and night was all.\nBut for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their\nfeet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls\nfelt, to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and\nagain, was straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope.\nThe tunnel was high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits\nwalked abreast, only touching the side-walls with their outstretched\nhands, they were separated, cut off alone in the darkness.\nGollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead.\nWhile they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear\nhis breath hissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time\ntheir senses became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow\nnumb, and they kept on, groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the\nforce of the will with which they had entered, will to go through and\ndesire to come at last to the high gate beyond.\nBefore they had gone very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon\npassed out of his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling the wall, was\naware that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught\na faint breath of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by.\n\u2018There\u2019s more than one passage here,\u2019 he whispered with an effort:\nit seemed hard to make his breath give any sound. \u2018It\u2019s as orc-like a\nplace as ever there could be!\u2019\nAfter that, first he on the right, and then Frodo on the left, passed\nthree or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there\nwas as yet no doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not\nturn, and still went steadily up. But how long was it, how much\nmore of this would they have to endure, or could they endure? The\nbreathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed; and now they\nseemed often in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker than\nthe foul air. As they thrust forward they felt things brush against their\nheads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or hanging growths\nperhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the stench grew.\nIt grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear\nsense left to them, and that was for their torment. One hour, two\nhours, three hours: how many had they passed in this lightless hole?\nHours \u2013 days, weeks rather. Sam left the tunnel-side and shrank\ntowards Frodo, and their hands met and clasped, and so together\nthey still went on."}
{"743": "opening in the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out\nof it came a reek so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense,\nthat Frodo reeled. And at that moment Sam too lurched and fell\nforwards.\nFighting off both the sickness and the fear, Frodo gripped Sam\u2019s\nhand. \u2018Up!\u2019 he said in a hoarse breath without voice. \u2018It all comes\nfrom here, the stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick!\u2019\nCalling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam\nto his feet, and forced his own limbs to move. Sam stumbled beside\nhim. One step, two steps, three steps \u2013 at last six steps. Maybe they\nhad passed the dreadful unseen opening, but whether that was so or\nnot, suddenly it was easier to move, as if some hostile will for the\nmoment had released them. They struggled on, still hand in hand.\nBut almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel\nforked, or so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which\nwas the wider way, or which kept nearer to the straight. Which should\nthey take, the left, or the right? They knew of nothing to guide them,\nyet a false choice would almost certainly be fatal.\n\u2018Which way has Gollum gone?\u2019 panted Sam. \u2018And why didn\u2019t he\nwait?\u2019\n\u2018Sme\u00b4agol!\u2019 said Frodo, trying to call. \u2018Sme\u00b4agol!\u2019 But his voice\ncroaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. There was\nno answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air.\n\u2018He\u2019s really gone this time, I fancy,\u2019 muttered Sam. \u2018I guess this\nis just exactly where he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands\non you again, you\u2019ll be sorry for it.\u2019\nPresently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the\nopening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some\ngreat stone had fallen in the passage. \u2018This can\u2019t be the way,\u2019 Frodo\nwhispered. \u2018Right or wrong, we must take the other.\u2019\n\u2018And quick!\u2019 Sam panted. \u2018There\u2019s something worse than Gollum\nabout. I can feel something looking at us.\u2019\nThey had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them\ncame a sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a\ngurgling, bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled\nround, but nothing could be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring,\nwaiting for they did not know what.\n\u2018It\u2019s a trap!\u2019 said Sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his\nsword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow\nwhence it came. \u2018I wish old Tom was near us now!\u2019 he thought.\nThen, as he stood, darkness about him and a blackness of despair\nand anger in his heart, it seemed to him that he saw a light: a light"}
{"744": "green, gold, silver, white. Far off, as in a little picture drawn by\nelven-fingers, he saw the Lady Galadriel standing on the grass in\nLo\u00b4rien, and gifts were in her hands. And you, Ring-bearer, he heard\nher say, remote but clear, for you I have prepared this.\nThe bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of\nsome great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark.\nA reek came on before it. \u2018Master, master!\u2019 cried Sam, and life and\nurgency came back into his voice. \u2018The Lady\u2019s gift! The star-glass!\nA light to you in dark places, she said it was to be. The star-glass!\u2019\n\u2018The star-glass?\u2019 muttered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep,\nhardly comprehending. \u2018Why yes! Why had I forgotten it? A light\nwhen all other lights go out! And now indeed light alone can help us.\u2019\nSlowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the\nPhial of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a rising star\nstruggling in heavy earthward mists, and then as its power waxed,\nand hope grew in Frodo\u2019s mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a\nsilver flame, a minute heart of dazzling light, as though Ea\u00a8rendil had\nhimself come down from the high sunset paths with the last Silmaril\nupon his brow. The darkness receded from it, until it seemed to shine\nin the centre of a globe of airy crystal, and the hand that held it\nsparkled with white fire.\nFrodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he had so\nlong carried, not guessing its full worth and potency. Seldom had he\nremembered it on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and\nnever had he used it for fear of its revealing light. Aiya Ea\u00a8rendil Elenion\nAncalima! he cried, and knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed\nthat another voice spoke through his, clear, untroubled by the foul\nair of the pit.\nBut other potencies there are in Middle-earth, powers of night,\nand they are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness\nhad heard the Elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and\nshe had not heeded it, and it did not daunt her now. Even as Frodo\nspoke he felt a great malice bent upon him, and a deadly regard\nconsidering him. Not far down the tunnel, between them and the\nopening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was aware of eyes\ngrowing visible, two great clusters of many-windowed eyes \u2013 the\ncoming menace was unmasked at last. The radiance of the star-glass\nwas broken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind\nthe glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame\nkindled in some deep pit of evil thought. Monstrous and abominable\neyes they were, bestial and yet filled with purpose and with hideous"}
{"745": "Frodo and Sam, horror-stricken, began slowly to back away, their\nown gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they\nbacked so the eyes advanced. Frodo\u2019s hand wavered, and slowly the\nPhial drooped. Then suddenly, released from the holding spell to\nrun a little while in vain panic for the amusement of the eyes, they\nboth turned and fled together; but even as they ran Frodo looked\nback and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up\nbehind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him.\n\u2018Stand! stand!\u2019 he cried desperately. \u2018Running is no use.\u2019\nSlowly the eyes crept nearer.\n\u2018Galadriel!\u2019 he called, and gathering his courage he lifted up the\nPhial once more. The eyes halted. For a moment their regard relaxed,\nas if some hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo\u2019s heart flamed\nwithin him, and without thinking what he did, whether it was folly\nor despair or courage, he took the Phial in his left hand, and with\nhis right hand drew his sword. Sting flashed out, and the sharp elven-\nblade sparkled in the silver light, but at its edges a blue fire flickered.\nThen holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced, Frodo,\nhobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to meet the eyes.\nThey wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached.\nOne by one they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No brightness\nso deadly had ever afflicted them before. From sun and moon and\nstar they had been safe underground, but now a star had descended\ninto the very earth. Still it approached, and the eyes began to quail.\nOne by one they all went dark; they turned away, and a great bulk,\nbeyond the light\u2019s reach, heaved its huge shadow in between. They\nwere gone.\n\u2018Master, master!\u2019 cried Sam. He was close behind, his own sword\ndrawn and ready. \u2018Stars and glory! But the Elves would make a song\nof that, if ever they heard of it! And may I live to tell them and hear\nthem sing. But don\u2019t go on, master! Don\u2019t go down to that den!\nNow\u2019s our only chance. Now let\u2019s get out of this foul hole!\u2019\nAnd so back they turned once more, first walking and then run-\nning; for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with\nevery stride they climbed higher above the stenches of the unseen\nlair, and strength returned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of\nthe Watcher lurked behind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but\nundefeated, still bent on death. And now there came a flow of air to\nmeet them, cold and thin. The opening, the tunnel\u2019s end, at last it\nwas before them. Panting, yearning for a roofless place, they flung\nthemselvesforward;andtheninamazementtheystaggered,tumbling"}

Across the width and height of the tunnel a\nvast web was spun, orderly as the web of some huge spider, but\ndenser-woven and far greater, and each thread was as thick as rope.\nSam laughed grimly. \u2018Cobwebs!\u2019 he said. \u2018Is that all? Cobwebs!\nBut what a spider! Have at \u2019em, down with \u2019em!\u2019\nIn a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he\nstruck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a\nplucked bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and\narm. Three times Sam struck with all his force, and at last one single\ncord of all the countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and\nwhipping through the air. One end of it lashed Sam\u2019s hand, and he\ncried out in pain, starting back and drawing his hand across his\nmouth.\n\u2018It will take days to clear the road like this,\u2019 he said. \u2018What\u2019s to\nbe done? Have those eyes come back?\u2019\n\u2018No, not to be seen,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But I still feel that they are\nlooking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, per-\nhaps. If this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly\ncome again.\u2019\n\u2018Trapped in the end!\u2019 said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above\nweariness and despair. \u2018Gnats in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite\nthat Gollum and bite him quick!\u2019\n\u2018That would not help us now,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Come! Let us see what\nSting can do. It is an elven-blade.

The blue-gleaming\nblade shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they leaped\nand writhed and then hung loose. A great rent was made.\nStroke after stroke he dealt, until at last all the web within his\nreach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a\nloose veil in the incoming wind.

The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and\nthe last hours of a sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor\nhad died away in sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked\nupon a morning of sudden hope. Almost he had reached the summit\nof the wall. Only a little higher now. The Cleft, Cirith Ungol, was\nbefore him, a dim notch in the black ridge, and the horns of rock\ndarkling in the sky on either side. A short race, a sprinter\u2019s course,\nand he would be through!\n\u2018The pass, Sam!\u2019 he cried, not heeding the shrillness of his voice,\nthat released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high\nand wild. \u2018The pass! Run, run, and we\u2019ll be through \u2013 through before\nanyone can stop us!\u2019\nSam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as\nhe was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing\nback at the dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape\nbeyond his imagining, spring out in pursuit. Too little did he or his\nmaster know of the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her\nlair.\nThere agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even\nsuch as once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West\nthat is now under the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains\nof Terror in Doriath, and so came to Lu\u00b4thien upon the green sward\namid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago. How Shelob came\nthere, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the Dark Years few\ntales have come. But still she was there, who was there before Sauron,\nand before the first stone of Barad-du\u02c6r; and she served none but\nherself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat\nwith endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all\nliving things were her food, and her vomit darkness. Far and wide\nher lesser broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring,\nthat she slew, spread from glen to glen, from the Ephel Du\u00b4ath to the\neastern hills, to Dol Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But\nnone could rival her, Shelob the Great, last child of Ungoliant to\ntrouble the unhappy world.\nAlready, years before, Gollum had beheld her, Sme\u00b4agol who pried\ninto all dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped\nher, and the darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of\nhis weariness beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret.\nAnd he had promised to bring her food. But her lust was not his\nlust. Little she knew of or cared for towers, or rings, or anything"}
{"748": "mountains could no longer hold her up and the darkness could not\ncontain her.\nBut that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been\nhungry, lurking in her den, while the power of Sauron grew, and\nlight and living things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley\nwas dead, and no Elf or Man came near, only the unhappy Orcs.\nPoor food and wary. But she must eat, and however busily they\ndelved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower,\never she found some way to snare them. But she lusted for sweeter\nmeat. And Gollum had brought it to her.\n\u2018We\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u2019 he said often to himself, when the evil mood\nwas on him, as he walked the dangerous road from Emyn Muil to\nMorgul Vale, \u2018we\u2019ll see. lt may well be, O yes, it may well be that\nwhen She throws away the bones and the empty garments, we shall\nfind it, we shall get it, the Precious, a reward for poor Sme\u00b4agol who\nbrings nice food. And we\u2019ll save the Precious, as we promised. O\nyes. And when we\u2019ve got it safe, then She\u2019ll know it, O yes, then\nwe\u2019ll pay Her back, my precious. Then we\u2019ll pay everyone back!\u2019\nSo he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still\nhoped to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and\nhad bowed low before her while his companions slept.\nAnd as for Sauron: he knew where she lurked. It pleased him that\nshe should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure\nwatch upon that ancient path into his land than any other that his\nskill could have devised. And Orcs, they were useful slaves, but he\nhad them in plenty. If now and again Shelob caught them to stay\nher appetite, she was welcome: he could spare them. And sometimes\nas a man may cast a dainty to his cat (his cat he calls her, but she\nowns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better\nuses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report brought\nback to him of the play she made.\nSo they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no\nassault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had\nany fly escaped from Shelob\u2019s webs, and the greater now was her\nrage and hunger.\nBut nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them\ndid poor Sam know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace\nwhich he could not see; and such a weight did it become that it was\na burden to him to run, and his feet seemed leaden.\nDread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and\nhismasterwasinafeymoodrunningheedlesslytomeetthem.Turn-"}

His master was gaining on him; already he was some twenty\nstrides ahead, flitting on like a shadow; soon he would be lost to sight\nin that grey world.\nHardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came.\nA little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a\nblack hole of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he\nhad ever beheld, horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most\nlike a spider she was, but huger than the great hunting beasts, and\nmore terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless\neyes. Those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated,\nthere they were lit with a fell light again, clustering in her out-thrust\nhead. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was\nher huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging\nbetween her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid marks,\nbut the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a\nstench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her\nback, and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg\u2019s end\nthere was a claw.\nAs soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its\nfolded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a\nhorrible speed, now running on her creaking legs, now making a\nsudden bound. She was between Sam and his master. Either she did\nnot see Sam, or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of\nthe light, and fixed all her intent upon one prey, upon Frodo, bereft\nof his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet of his peril.\nSwiftly he ran, but Shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she would have\nhim.\nSam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. \u2018Look\nout behind!\u2019 he yelled. \u2018Look out, master! I\u2019m\u2019 \u2013 but suddenly his\ncry was stifled.\nA long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught"}
{"750": "\u2018Got him!\u2019 hissed Gollum in his ear. \u2018At last, my precious, we\u2019ve\ngot him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She\u2019ll get the other.\nO yes, Shelob will get him, not Sme\u00b4agol: he promised; he won\u2019t\nhurt Master at all. But he\u2019s got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!\u2019\nHe spat on Sam\u2019s neck.\nFury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master\nwas in deadly peril, gave to Sam a sudden violence and strength that\nwas far beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow\nstupid hobbit, as he thought him. Not Gollum himself could have\ntwisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on Sam\u2019s mouth\nslipped, and Sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear\naway from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in his hand, and\non his left arm, hanging by its thong, was Faramir\u2019s staff. Desperately\nhe tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum was too quick. His\nlong right arm shot out, and he grabbed Sam\u2019s wrist: his fingers were\nlike a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward,\ntill with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground;\nand all the while Gollum\u2019s other hand was tightening on Sam\u2019s throat.\nThen Sam played his last trick. With all his strength he pulled\naway and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs\nagainst the ground and with his whole force hurled himself back-\nwards.\nNot expecting even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell over\nwith Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in\nhis stomach. A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his\nhand upon Sam\u2019s throat loosened; but his fingers still gripped the\nsword-hand. Sam tore himself forward and away, and stood up, and\nthen quickly he wheeled away to his right, pivoted on the wrist held\nby Gollum. Laying hold of the staff with his left hand, Sam swung\nit up, and down it came with a whistling crack on Gollum\u2019s out-\nstretched arm, just below the elbow.\nWith a squeal Gollum let go. Then Sam waded in; not waiting to\nchange the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick\nas a snake Gollum slithered aside, and the stroke aimed at his head\nfell across his back. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough\nfor him. Grabbing from behind was an old game of his, and seldom\nhad he failed in it. But this time, misled by spite, he had made the\nmistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his\nvictim\u2019s neck. Everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan,\nsince that horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness.\nAnd now he was face to face with a furious enemy, little less than\nhis own size. This fight was not for him. Sam swept up his sword"}
{"751": "Sam could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back\ntowards the tunnel.\nSword in hand Sam went after him. For the moment he had\nforgotten everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire\nto kill Gollum. But before he could overtake him, Gollum was gone.\nThen as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to\nmeet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of Frodo and the monster\nsmote upon Sam\u2019s mind. He spun round, and rushed wildly up the\npath, calling and calling his master\u2019s name. He was too late. So far\nGollum\u2019s plot had succeeded."}
{"752": "Chapter 10\nTHE CHOICES OF\nMASTER SAMWISE\nFrodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was\nbending over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed\nof Sam and his cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he\nsaw that Frodo was already bound in cords, wound about him from\nankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was begin-\nning half to lift, half to drag his body away.\nOn the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-\nblade, where it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait\nto wonder what was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal,\nor filled with rage. He sprang forward with a yell, and seized his\nmaster\u2019s sword in his left hand. Then he charged. No onslaught\nmore fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts, where some\ndesperate small creature armed with little teeth, alone, will spring\nupon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate.\nDisturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she\nturned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost\nbefore she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she\nhad known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot\nand shore away the claw. Sam sprang in, inside the arches of her\nlegs, and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the\nclustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great eye went dark.\nNow the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment\nout of the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was\nabove him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote\nhim down. Still his fury held for one more blow, and before she\ncould sink upon him, smothering him and all his little impudence of\ncourage, he slashed the bright elven-blade across her with desperate\nstrength.\nBut Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save\nonly her eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old\nhide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth.\nThe blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds\ncould not be pierced by any strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf\nshould forge the steel or the hand of Beren or of Tu\u00b4rin wield it. She"}
{"753": "Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again.\nToo soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own\nsword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fend-\ning off that ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her\nown cruel will, with strength greater than any warrior\u2019s hand, thrust\nherself upon a bitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed\nslowly to the ground.\nNo such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing,\nin all her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old\nGondor, nor the most savage Orc entrapped, had ever thus endured\nher, or set blade to her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her.\nHeaving up again, wrenching away from the pain, she bent her writh-\ning limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap.\nSam had fallen to his knees by Frodo\u2019s head, his senses reeling in\nthe foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword.\nThrough the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo\u2019s face,\nand stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out\nof the swoon that was upon him. Slowly he raised his head and saw\nher, only a few paces away, eyeing him, her beak drabbling a spittle\nof venom, and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye.\nThere she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground,\nthe great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself for\nanother spring \u2013 this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite\nof poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then\nto rend.\nEven as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in\nher eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken,\nand he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he\nsought: cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom\nworld of horror, the Phial of Galadriel.\n\u2018Galadriel!\u2019 he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but\nclear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the\nbeloved shadows of the Shire, and the music of the Elves as it came\nthrough his sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond.\nGilthoniel A Elbereth!\nAnd then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language\nwhich he did not know:\nA Elbereth Gilthoniel\no menel palan-diriel,"}
{"754": "And with that he staggered to his feet and was Samwise the hobbit,\nHamfast\u2019s son, again.\n\u2018Now come, you filth!\u2019 he cried. \u2018You\u2019ve hurt my master, you\nbrute, and you\u2019ll pay for it. We\u2019re going on; but we\u2019ll settle with you\nfirst. Come on, and taste it again!\u2019\nAs if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass\nblazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star\nthat leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable\nlight. No such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob\u2019s face\nbefore. The beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored\nit with unbearable pain, and the dreadful infection of light spread\nfrom eye to eye. She fell back beating the air with her forelegs, her\nsight blasted by inner lightnings, her mind in agony. Then turning\nher maimed head away, she rolled aside and began to crawl, claw by\nclaw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind.\nSam came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came\non. And Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered\nas she tried to hasten from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing\ndown, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as\nSam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the\nground.\nShelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her\nmalice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself\nfrom within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like\ndeath she spun once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the\nMountains of Shadow, this tale does not tell.\nSam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening of the Nameless Land\nfell upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master.\n\u2018Master, dear master,\u2019 he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he\nhad run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous\nspeed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in\nthe neck. He lay now pale, and heard no voice, and did not move.\n\u2018Master, dear master!\u2019 said Sam, and through a long silence waited,\nlistening in vain.\nThen as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and\nlaid his head upon Frodo\u2019s breast and to his mouth, but no stir of\nlife could he find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he\nchafed his master\u2019s hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all\nwere cold.\n\u2018Frodo, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he called. \u2018Don\u2019t leave me here alone! It\u2019s\nyourSamcalling.Don\u2019tgowhereIcan\u2019tfollow!Wakeup,Mr.Frodo!"}
{"755": "Then anger surged over him, and he ran about his master\u2019s body\nin a rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting\nchallenges. Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo\u2019s\nface, pale beneath him in the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was\nin the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in\nLo\u00b4rien: Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark\ncliff. Or fast asleep he had thought then. \u2018He\u2019s dead!\u2019 he said. \u2018Not\nasleep, dead!\u2019 And as he said it, as if the words had set the venom\nto its work again, it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid\ngreen.\nAnd then black despair came down on him, and Sam bowed to\nthe ground, and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came\ninto his heart, and he knew no more.\nWhen at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows\nwere about him; but for how many minutes or hours the world had\ngone dragging on he could not tell. He was still in the same place,\nand still his master lay beside him dead. The mountains had not\ncrumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin.\n\u2018What shall I do, what shall I do?\u2019 he said. \u2018Did I come all this\nway with him for nothing?\u2019 And then he remembered his own voice\nspeaking words that at the time he did not understand himself, at\nthe beginning of their journey: I have something to do before the end. I\nmust see it through, sir, if you understand.\n\u2018But what can I do? Not leave Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on the\ntop of the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?\u2019 he repeated,\nand for a moment doubt and fear shook him. \u2018Go on? Is that what\nI\u2019ve got to do? And leave him?\u2019\nThen at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed\nhis body, and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped\nhis cloak about him; and he laid his own sword at one side, and the\nstaff that Faramir had given at the other.\n\u2018If I\u2019m to go on,\u2019 he said, \u2018then I must take your sword, by your\nleave, Mr. Frodo, but I\u2019ll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the\nold king in the barrow; and you\u2019ve got your beautiful mithril coat\nfrom old Mr. Bilbo. And your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it\nto me and I\u2019ll need it, for I\u2019ll be always in the dark now. It\u2019s too good\nfor me, and the Lady gave it to you, but maybe she\u2019d understand. Do\nyou understand, Mr. Frodo? I\u2019ve got to go on.\u2019\nBut he could not go, not yet.

{"756": "lonely journey \u2013 for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would\nbear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him\nat last: Gollum. Then Gollum would die in a corner. But that was\nnot what he had set out to do. It would not be worth while to leave\nhis master for that. It would not bring him back. Nothing would.\nThey had better both be dead together. And that too would be a\nlonely journey.\nHe looked on the bright point of the sword. He thought of the\nplaces behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into\nnothingness. There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing,\nnot even to grieve. That was not what he had set out to do. \u2018What\nam I to do then?\u2019 he cried again, and now he seemed plainly to know\nthe hard answer: see it through. Another lonely journey, and the worst.\n\u2018What? Me, alone, go to the Crack of Doom and all?\u2019 He quailed\nstill, but the resolve grew. \u2018What? Me take the Ring from him? The\nCouncil gave it to him.\u2019\nBut the answer came at once: \u2018And the Council gave him com-\npanions, so that the errand should not fail. And you are the last of\nall the Company. The errand must not fail.\u2019\n\u2018I wish I wasn\u2019t the last,\u2019 he groaned. \u2018I wish old Gandalf was here,\nor somebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind? I\u2019m sure\nto go wrong. And it\u2019s not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself\nforward.\u2019\n\u2018But you haven\u2019t put yourself forward; you\u2019ve been put forward.\nAnd as for not being the right and proper person, why, Mr. Frodo\nwasn\u2019t, as you might say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn\u2019t choose them-\nselves.\u2019\n\u2018Ah well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But\nI\u2019ll be sure to go wrong: that\u2019d be Sam Gamgee all over.\n\u2018Let me see now: if we\u2019re found here, or Mr. Frodo\u2019s found, and\nthat Thing\u2019s on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that\u2019s the end\nof all of us, of Lo\u00b4 rien, and Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And\nthere\u2019s no time to lose, or it\u2019ll be the end anyway.

No, it\u2019s\nsit here till they come and kill me over master\u2019s body, and gets It;\nor take It and go.\u2019 He drew a deep breath. \u2018Then take It, it is!\u2019\nHe stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped\nhis hand inside Frodo\u2019s tunic; then with his other hand raising the\nhead, he kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over it.\nAnd then the head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came"}
{"757": "\u2018Good-bye, master, my dear!\u2019 he murmured. \u2018Forgive your Sam.\nHe\u2019ll come back to this spot when the job\u2019s done \u2013 if he manages it.\nAnd then he\u2019ll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and\nmay no foul creature come anigh you! And if the Lady could hear\nme and give me one wish, I would wish to come back and find you\nagain. Good-bye!\u2019\nAnd then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at\nonce his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring,\nas if a great stone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight\nbecame less, or new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and\nthen with a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk\nand bear his burden. And for a moment he lifted up the Phial and\nlooked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the\nsoft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and in that light Frodo\u2019s\nface was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an Elvish beauty,\nas of one who has long passed the shadows. And with the bitter\ncomfort of that last sight Sam turned and hid the light and stumbled\non into the growing dark.\nHe had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft\na couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the\ndusk, a deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in\na long trough with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly.\nSoon Sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the\norc-tower was right above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye\nglowed. Now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it. He was\ncoming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft at last.\n\u2018I\u2019ve made up my mind,\u2019 he kept saying to himself. But he had\nnot. Though he had done his best to think it out, what he was doing\nwas altogether against the grain of his nature. \u2018Have I got it wrong?\u2019\nhe muttered. \u2018What ought I to have done?\u2019\nAs the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached\nthe actual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending\ninto the Nameless Land, he turned. For a moment, motionless in\nintolerable doubt, he looked back. He could still see, like a small blot\nin the gathering gloom, the mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he\ncould see or guess where Frodo lay. He fancied there was a glimmer\non the ground down there, or perhaps it was some trick of his tears,\nas he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen\nin ruin.\n\u2018If only I could have my wish, my one wish,\u2019 he sighed, \u2018to go back\nandfind him!\u2019Thenat lastheturnedto theroadin frontandtook a"}

Tramping feet and shouts behind.\nHe wheeled round. He saw small red lights, torches, winking away\nbelow there as they issued from the tunnel. At last the hunt was up.\nThe red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught.\nNow the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead\nwas very near. In a minute they would reach the top and be on him.\nHe had taken too long in making up his mind, and now it was no\ngood. How could he escape, or save himself, or save the Ring? The\nRing. He was not aware of any thought or decision. He simply found\nhimself drawing out the chain and taking the Ring in his hand. The\nhead of the orc-company appeared in the Cleft right before him.\nThen he put it on.\nThe world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with\nan hour of thought. At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened\nwhile sight was dimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob\u2019s lair. All\nthings about him now were not dark but vague; while he himself was\nthere in a grey hazy world, alone, like a small black solid rock, and\nthe Ring, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold.\nHe did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and uniquely visible; and\nhe knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him.\nHe heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in\nMorgul Vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of\nShelob, groping, lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dun-\ngeons of the tower; and the cries of the Orcs as they came out of the\ntunnel; and deafening, roaring in his ears, the crash of the feet and\nthe rending clamour of the Orcs before him. He shrank against the\ncliff. But they marched up like a phantom company, grey distorted\nfigures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands.\nAnd they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep away into some\ncranny and to hide.\nHe listened. The Orcs from the tunnel and the others marching\ndown had sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying\nand shouting. He heard them both clearly, and he understood what\nthey said.

Then he drew\nhis sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears.\n\u2018Curse the filth!\u2019 he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.\nIt no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was\nas if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His weariness\nwas growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could\nsee the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he\ncould not catch them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel\nthey knew well; for in spite of Shelob they were forced to use it often\nas the swiftest way from the Dead City over the mountains. In what\nfar-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made,\nwhere Shelob had taken up her abode in ages past, they did not\nknow; but many byways they had themselves delved about it on either\nside, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business\nof their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far down, but were\nhastening to find a side-passage that led back to their watch-tower on\nthe cliff. Most of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had\nfound and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after\nthe fashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices,\nflat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices\nfrom among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The\ncaptains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating\nas they went.\n\u2018Can\u2019t you stop your rabble making such a racket, Shagrat?\u2019"}
{"761": "the other. \u2018But let the lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for\na bit, I reckon. She\u2019s sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan\u2019t cry about\nthat. Didn\u2019t you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed\ncrack of hers? If we\u2019ve stopped it once, we\u2019ve stopped it a hundred\ntimes. So let \u2019em laugh. And we\u2019ve struck a bit of luck at last: got\nsomething that Lugbu\u00b4 rz wants.\u2019\n\u2018Lugbu\u00b4rz wants it, eh? What is it, d\u2019you think? Elvish it looked to\nme, but undersized. What\u2019s the danger in a thing like that?\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t know till we\u2019ve had a look.\u2019\n\u2018Oho! So they haven\u2019t told you what to expect? They don\u2019t tell us\nall they know, do they? Not by half. But they can make mistakes,\neven the Top Ones can.\u2019\n\u2018Sh, Gorbag!\u2019 Shagrat\u2019s voice was lowered, so that even with his\nstrangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just catch what was said.\n\u2018They may, but they\u2019ve got eyes and ears everywhere; some among\nmy lot, as like as not. But there\u2019s no doubt about it, they\u2019re troubled\nabout something. The Nazgu\u02c6l down below are, by your account; and\nLugbu\u00b4rz is too. Something nearly slipped.\u2019\n\u2018Nearly, you say!\u2019 said Gorbag.\n\u2018All right,\u2019 said Shagrat, \u2018but we\u2019ll talk of that later. Wait till we\nget to the Under-way. There\u2019s a place there where we can talk a bit,\nwhile the lads go on.\u2019\nShortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then there was\na rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he\ncould guess the Orcs had turned and gone into the very opening\nwhich Frodo and he had tried and found blocked. It was still blocked.\nThere seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the Orcs had\ngot through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other\nside. They were still running along, deeper and deeper into the moun-\ntain, back towards the tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying\noff his master\u2019s body for some foul purpose and he could not follow.\nHe thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himself against it,\nbut it did not yield. Then not far inside, or so he thought, he heard\nthe two captains\u2019 voices talking again. He stood still listening for a\nlittle, hoping perhaps to learn something useful. Perhaps Gorbag,\nwho seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and he\ncould then slip in.\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Gorbag\u2019s voice. \u2018The messages go through\nquicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don\u2019t enquire how\nit\u2019s done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgu\u02c6l give me the creeps. And\nthey skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all\ncold in the dark on the other side. But He likes \u2019em; they\u2019re His"}
{"762": "\u2018You should try being up here with Shelob for company,\u2019 said\nShagrat.\n\u2018I\u2019d like to try somewhere where there\u2019s none of \u2019em. But the war\u2019s\non now, and when that\u2019s over things may be easier.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s going well, they say.\u2019\n\u2018They would,\u2019 grunted Gorbag. \u2018We\u2019ll see. But anyway, if it does\ngo well, there should be a lot more room. What d\u2019you say? \u2013 if we\nget a chance, you and me\u2019ll slip off and set up somewhere on our\nown with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there\u2019s good loot nice\nand handy, and no big bosses.\u2019\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Shagrat. \u2018Like old times.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gorbag. \u2018But don\u2019t count on it. I\u2019m not easy in my\nmind. As I said, the Big Bosses, ay,\u2019 his voice sank almost to a\nwhisper, \u2018ay, even the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly\nslipped, you say. I say, something has slipped. And we\u2019ve got to look\nout. Always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. But\ndon\u2019t forget: the enemies don\u2019t love us any more than they love Him,\nand if they get topsides on Him, we\u2019re done too. But see here: when\nwere you ordered out?\u2019\n\u2018About an hour ago, just before you saw us. A message came:\nNazgu\u02c6l uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head\nof Stairs. I came at once.\u2019\n\u2018Bad business,\u2019 said Gorbag. \u2018See here \u2013 our Silent Watchers were\nuneasy more than two days ago, that I know. But my patrol wasn\u2019t\nordered out for another day, nor any message sent to Lugbu\u00b4rz either:\nowing to the Great Signal going up, and the High Nazgu\u02c6l going off\nto the war, and all that. And then they couldn\u2019t get Lugbu\u00b4rz to pay\nattention for a good while, I\u2019m told.\u2019\n\u2018The Eye was busy elsewhere, I suppose,\u2019 said Shagrat. \u2018Big things\ngoing on away west, they say.\u2019\n\u2018I daresay,\u2019 growled Gorbag. \u2018But in the meantime enemies have\ngot up the Stairs. And what were you up to? You\u2019re supposed to\nkeep watch, aren\u2019t you, special orders or no? What are you for?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s enough! Don\u2019t try and teach me my job. We were awake\nall right. We knew there were funny things going on.\u2019\n\u2018Very funny!\u2019\n\u2018Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But Shelob was on\nthe go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.\u2019\n\u2018Her Sneak? What\u2019s that?\u2019\n\u2018You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider\nhimself, or perhaps more like a starved frog.

{"763": "with Her Ladyship. I suppose he\u2019s no good to eat: she wouldn\u2019t worry\nabout words from High Up. But a fine guard you keep in the valley:\nhe was up here a day before all this racket. Early last night we saw\nhim. Anyway my lads reported that Her Ladyship was having some\nfun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came.\nI thought her Sneak had brought her a toy, or that you\u2019d perhaps\nsent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. I don\u2019t interfere\nwhen she\u2019s playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when she\u2019s on the hunt.\u2019\n\u2018Nothing, say you! Didn\u2019t you use your eyes back there? I tell you\nI\u2019m not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by.\nIt cut her web and got clean out of the hole. That\u2019s something to\nthink about!\u2019\n\u2018Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn\u2019t she?\u2019\n\u2018Got him? Got who? This little fellow? But if he was the only one,\nthen she\u2019d have had him off to her larder long before, and there he\u2019d\nbe now. And if Lugbu\u00b4rz wanted him, you\u2019d have to go and get him.\nNice for you. But there was more than one.\u2019\nAt this point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his\near against the stone.\n\u2018Who cut the cords she\u2019d put round him, Shagrat? Same one as\ncut the web. Didn\u2019t you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her\nLadyship? Same one, I reckon. And where is he? Where is he,\nShagrat?\u2019\nShagrat made no reply.\n\u2018You may well put your thinking cap on, if you\u2019ve got one. It\u2019s no\nlaughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before,\nas you should know well enough. There\u2019s no grief in that; but think\n\u2013 there\u2019s someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any\nother damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since\nthe Great Siege. Something has slipped.\u2019\n\u2018And what is it then?\u2019 growled Shagrat.\n\u2018By all the signs, Captain Shagrat, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a large warrior\nloose, Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well\nmaybe; and he\u2019s loose in your bounds, too, and you\u2019ve never spotted\nhim. Very funny indeed!\u2019 Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this\ndescription of himself.\n\u2018Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view,\u2019 said Shagrat. \u2018You\ncan read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to\nexplain them. Anyhow, I\u2019ve got watchers at every point, and I\u2019m\ngoing to deal with one thing at a time. When I\u2019ve had a look at the\nfellow we have caught, then I\u2019ll begin to worry about something\nelse.\u2019"}

We\u2019ve talked enough. Let\u2019s go and have\na look at the prisoner!\u2019\n\u2018What are you going to do with him? Don\u2019t forget I spotted him\nfirst. If there\u2019s any game, me and my lads must be in it.\u2019\n\u2018Now, now,\u2019 growled Shagrat, \u2018I have my orders. And it\u2019s more\nthan my belly\u2019s worth, or yours, to break \u2019em. Any trespasser found\nby the guard is to be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped.\nFull description of every article, garment, weapon, letter, ring, or\ntrinket is to be sent to Lugbu\u00b4rz at once, and to Lugbu\u00b4rz only. And\nthe prisoner is to be kept safe and intact, under pain of death for\nevery member of the guard, until He sends or comes Himself. That\u2019s\nplain enough, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\n\u2018Stripped, eh?\u2019 said Gorbag. \u2018What, teeth, nails, hair, and all?\u2019\n\u2018No, none of that. He\u2019s for Lugbu\u00b4rz, I tell you. He\u2019s wanted safe\nand whole.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019ll find that difficult,\u2019 laughed Gorbag. \u2018He\u2019s nothing but car-\nrion now. What Lugbu\u00b4rz will do with such stuff I can\u2019t guess. He\nmight as well go in the pot.\u2019\n\u2018You fool,\u2019 snarled Shagrat. \u2018You\u2019ve been talking very clever, but\nthere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know, though most other folk do. You\u2019ll be\nfor the pot or for Shelob, if you don\u2019t take care. Carrion! Is that all\nyou know of Her Ladyship? When she binds with cords, she\u2019s after\nmeat. She doesn\u2019t eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow\nisn\u2019t dead!\u2019\nSam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if the whole dark\nworld was turning upside down. So great was the shock that he almost\nswooned, but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep\ninside him he was aware of the comment: \u2018You fool, he isn\u2019t dead,\nand your heart knew it. Don\u2019t trust your head, Samwise, it is not the\nbest part of you. The trouble with you is that you never really had\nany hope. Now what is to be done?\u2019 For the moment nothing, but\nto prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen, listen to the\nvile orc-voices.\n\u2018Garn!\u2019 said Shagrat. \u2018She\u2019s got more than one poison. When she\u2019s\nhunting, she just gives \u2019em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as\nboned fish, and then she has her way with them. D\u2019you remember\nold Ufthak? We lost him for days.

{"765": "few hours; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a bit, he\u2019ll be all right.\nOr would be, if Lugbu\u00b4rz would let him alone. And of course, beyond\nwondering where he is and what\u2019s happened to him.\u2019\n\u2018And what\u2019s going to happen to him,\u2019 laughed Gorbag. \u2018We can\ntell him a few stories at any rate, if we can\u2019t do anything else. I don\u2019t\nsuppose he\u2019s ever been in lovely Lugbu\u00b4 rz, so he may like to know\nwhat to expect. This is going to be more funny than I thought.

He was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury\nwas on him. \u2018I got it all wrong!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I knew I would. Now\nthey\u2019ve got him, the devils! the filth! Never leave your master, never,\nnever: that was my right rule. And I knew it in my heart. May I be\nforgiven! Now I\u2019ve got to get back to him. Somehow, somehow!\u2019\nHe drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but\nit only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so brightly\nnow that he could see dimly in its light. To his surprise he noticed\nthat the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than\ntwice his own height. Above it was a dark blank space between the\ntop and the low arch of the opening. It was probably only meant to\nbe a stop against the intrusion of Shelob, fastened on the inside with\nsome latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. With his remain-\ning strength Sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and\ndropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a\nbend and up a winding tunnel.\nThe news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort\nbeyond thought of weariness. He could not see anything ahead, for\nthis new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he\nwas catching the two Orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again.\nNow they seemed quite close.\n\u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u2019 said Shagrat in angry tones. \u2018Put\nhim right up in the top chamber.\u2019\n\u2018What for?\u2019 growled Gorbag. \u2018Haven\u2019t you any lock-ups down\nbelow?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019sgoingoutofharm\u2019sway,Itellyou,\u2019answeredShagrat.\u2018See?"}

He could see them\nnow, black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at\nlast, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double\ndoors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn\nof the tower. Already the Orcs with their burden had passed inside.\nGorbag and Shagrat were drawing near the gate.\nSam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging\nof gongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on\nthe threshold.\nSam yelled and brandished Sting, but his little voice was drowned\nin the tumult. No one heeded him.\nThe great doors slammed to. Boom. The bars of iron fell into\nplace inside. Clang. The gate was shut. Sam hurled himself against\nthe bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He was out\nin the darkness.

{"771": "Chapter 1\nMINAS TIRITH\nPippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf \u2019s cloak. He wondered\nif he was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in\nwhich he had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. The\ndark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He\ncould see nothing but the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast\nshadows against the sky where the mountains of the South marched\npast. Sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of their journey,\nbut his memory was drowsy and uncertain.\nThere had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and\nthen in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had\ncome to the silent town and the great empty house on the hill. And\nhardly had they reached its shelter when the winged shadow had\npassed over once again, and men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had\nspoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but\nuneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and\nGandalf giving orders. And then again riding, riding in the night.\nThis was the second, no, the third night since he had looked in the\nStone. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered,\nand the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.\nA light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark bar-\nriers. Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what\ndreadful country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and\nthen he saw that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows,\nnow almost at the full. So the night was not yet old and for hours\nthe dark journey would go on. He stirred and spoke.\n\u2018Where are we, Gandalf ?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018In the realm of Gondor,\u2019 the wizard answered. \u2018The land of\nAno\u00b4rien is still passing by.\u2019\nThere was a silence again for a while. Then, \u2018What is that?\u2019 cried\nPippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf \u2019s cloak. \u2018Look! Fire, red fire!\nAre there dragons in this land? Look, there is another!\u2019\nFor answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. \u2018On, Shadowfax! We\nmust hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight,\ncalling for aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon D\u02c6\u0131n,\nand flame on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol,\nErelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad, and the Halifirien on the borders"}
{"772": "he lifted up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the\nanswering neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of\nhoofs was heard, and three riders swept up and passed like flying\nghosts in the moon and vanished into the West. Then Shadowfax\ngathered himself together and sprang away, and the night flowed over\nhim like a roaring wind.\nPippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf\ntelling him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City\nhad beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of\nthe great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh\nhorses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan\nin the North, or to Belfalas in the South. \u2018It is long since the beacons\nof the North were lit,\u2019 he said; \u2018and in the ancient days of Gondor\nthey were not needed, for they had the Seven Stones.\u2019 Pippin stirred\nuneasily.\n\u2018Sleep again, and do not be afraid!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018For you are not\ngoing like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will\nbe as safe as you can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or\nthe Ring is taken, then the Shire will be no refuge.\u2019\n\u2018You do not comfort me,\u2019 said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept\nover him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep\ndream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating\nisles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon.\nHe wondered where Frodo was, and if he was already in Mordor, or\nif he was dead; and he did not know that Frodo from far away looked\non that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the\nday.\nPippin woke to the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a\nnight of journey had fleeted by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was\nat hand again, and chill grey mists were about them. Shadowfax stood\nsteaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no\nsign of weariness. Many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him,\nand behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. Partly ruinous\nit seemed, but already before the night was passed the sound of\nhurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels,\nand the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and\nthere in the fog. Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his\nway, and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was\nbeing discussed.\n\u2018Yea truly, we know you, Mithrandir,\u2019 said the leader of the men,\n\u2018and you know the pass-words of the Seven Gates and are free to go"}

He has\npassed through more battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though\nyou be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of\nIsengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on him,\nor I would wake him. His name is Peregrin, a very valiant man.\u2019\n\u2018Man?\u2019 said Ingold dubiously, and the others laughed.\n\u2018Man!\u2019 cried Pippin, now thoroughly roused. \u2018Man! Indeed not! I\nam a hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now\nand again by necessity. Do not let Gandalf deceive you!\u2019\n\u2018Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,\u2019 said Ingold. \u2018But\nwhat is a hobbit?\u2019\n\u2018A Halfling,\u2019 answered Gandalf. \u2018Nay, not the one that was spoken\nof,\u2019 he added seeing the wonder in the men\u2019s faces. \u2018Not he, yet one\nof his kindred.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, and one who journeyed with him,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018And Boromir\nof your City was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the North,\nand at the last he was slain defending me from many foes.\u2019\n\u2018Peace!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The news of that grief should have been\ntold first to the father.\u2019\n\u2018It has been guessed already,\u2019 said Ingold; \u2018for there have been\nstrange portents here of late. But pass on now quickly!

Courage will now be your best\ndefence against the storm that is at hand \u2013 that and such hope as I\nbring. For not all the tidings that I bring are evil.

For\nten leagues or more it ran from the mountains\u2019 feet and so back\nagain, enclosing in its fence the fields of the Pelennor: fair and fertile\ntownlands on the long slopes and terraces falling to the deep levels\nof the Anduin. At its furthest point from the Great Gate of the City,\nnorth-eastward, the wall was four leagues distant, and there from a\nfrowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river, and men\nhad made it high and strong; for at that point, upon a walled cause-\nway, the road came in from the fords and bridges of Osgiliath and\npassed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its\nnearest point the wall was little more than one league from the City,\nand that was south-eastward. There Anduin, going in a wide knee\nabout the hills of Emyn Arnen in South Ithilien, bent sharply west,\nand the out-wall rose upon its very brink; and beneath it lay the\nquays and landings of the Harlond for craft that came upstream from\nthe southern fiefs.\nThe townlands were rich, with wide tilth and many orchards, and\nhomesteads there were with oast and garner, fold and byre, and many\nrills rippling through the green from the highlands down to Anduin.\nYet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many,\nand the most part of the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles\nof the City, or in the high vales of the mountain-borders, in Lossar-\nnach, or further south in fair Lebennin with its five swift streams.\nThere dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea. They\nwere reckoned men of Gondor, yet their blood was mingled, and\nthere were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came\nmore from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills\nin the Dark Years ere the coming of the kings. But beyond, in the\ngreat fief of Belfalas, dwelt Prince Imrahil in his castle of Dol Amroth\nby the sea, and he was of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and\nproud with sea-grey eyes.\nNow after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew\nin the sky, and Pippin roused himself and looked up.

Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of\nEcthelion, standing high within the topmost wall, shone out against\nthe sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and\nshapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals;\nand white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the\nmorning breeze, and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver\ntrumpets.\nSo Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate of the Men of\nGondor at the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before\nthem.\n\u2018Mithrandir! Mithrandir!\u2019 men cried. \u2018Now we know that the storm\nis indeed nigh!\u2019\n\u2018It is upon you,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I have ridden on its wings. Let me\npass!

Let me pass!\u2019\nThen men fell back before the command of his voice and ques-\ntioned him no further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit\nthat sat before him and at the horse that bore him. For the people\nof the City used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their\nstreets, save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord. And\nthey said: \u2018Surely that is one of the great steeds of the King of Rohan?\nMaybe the Rohirrim will come soon to strengthen us.\u2019 But Shadowfax\nwalked proudly up the long winding road.\nFor the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven\nlevels, each delved into the hill, and about each was set a wall, and\nin each wall was a gate.

Up it rose, even to the level of the topmost circle, and\nthere was crowned by a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might,\nlike mariners in a mountainous ship, look from its peak sheer down\nupon the Gate seven hundred feet below. The entrance to the Citadel\nalso looked eastward, but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence\na long lamp-lit slope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus men reached\nat last the High Court, and the Place of the Fountain before the feet\nof the White Tower: tall and shapely, fifty fathoms from its base to\nthe pinnacle, where the banner of the Stewards floated a thousand\nfeet above the plain.\nA strong citadel it was indeed, and not to be taken by a host of\nenemies, if there were any within that could hold weapons; unless\nsome foe could come behind and scale the lower skirts of Mindolluin,\nand so come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard\nto the mountain mass. But that shoulder, which rose to the height\nof the fifth wall, was hedged with great ramparts right up to the\nprecipice that overhung its western end; and in that space stood the\nhouses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords, for ever silent\nbetween the mountain and the tower.\nPippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and\nmore splendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and\nstronger than Isengard, and far more beautiful. Yet it was in truth\nfalling year by year into decay; and already it lacked half the men\nthat could have dwelt at ease there. In every street they passed some\ngreat house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carved\nmany fair letters of strange and ancient shapes: names Pippin guessed\nof great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there; and yet now\nthey were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements, nor\nvoice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from door or\nempty window.\nAt last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate, and the warm\nsun that shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades\nof Ithilien, glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and\nthe great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and\nkingly head.

A sweet foun-\ntain played there in the morning sun, and a sward of bright green\nlay about it; but in the midst, drooping over the pool, stood a dead\ntree, and the falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and broken\nbranches back into the clear water.\nPippin glanced at it as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mourn-\nful, he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this\nplace where everything else was well tended.\nSeven stars and seven stones and one white tree.\nThe words that Gandalf had murmured came back into his mind.\nAnd then he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath\nthe gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent\ndoor-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of\nstone.\nThey walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they\nwent Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin. \u2018Be careful of your words,\nMaster Peregrin!

Pippin\nlooked into a great hall. It was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles\nat either side, beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof.\nMonoliths of black marble, they rose to great capitals carved in many\nstrange figures of beasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide\nvaulting gleamed with dull gold. The floor was of polished stone,\nwhite-gleaming, inset with flowing traceries of many colours. No\nhangings nor storied webs, nor any things of woven stuff or of wood,\nwere to be seen in that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there\nstood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone.\nSuddenly Pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of Argonath,\nand awe fell on him, as he looked down that avenue of kings long\ndead. At the far end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne\nunder a canopy of marble shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was\ncarved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower.\nBut the throne was empty. At the foot of the dais, upon the lowest\nstep which was broad and deep, there was a stone chair, black and\nunadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. In his hand\nwas a white rod with a golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly\nthey paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces\nfrom his footstool. Then Gandalf spoke.\n\u2018Hail, Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith, Denethor son of\nEcthelion! I am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.\u2019\nThen the old man looked up. Pippin saw his carven face with its\nproud bones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between\nthe dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir\nas of Aragorn. \u2018Dark indeed is the hour,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018and at\nsuch times you are wont to come, Mithrandir.

My\nBoromir! Now we have need of you.

You have had news of that ere we came?\u2019\n\u2018I have received this,\u2019 said Denethor, and laying down his rod he\nlifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. In each hand\nhe held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a\nwild-ox horn bound with silver.\n\u2018That is the horn that Boromir always wore!\u2019 cried Pippin.\n\u2018Verily,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018And in my turn I bore it, and so did each\neldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the\nfailing of the kings, since Vorondil father of Mardil hunted the wild\nkine of Araw in the far fields of Rhu\u02c6n. I heard it blowing dim upon\nthe northern marches thirteen days ago, and the River brought it to\nme, broken: it will wind no more.\u2019 He paused and there was a heavy\nsilence.

Then I swooned and was made captive.\nI saw him no more, and know no more. But I honour his memory,\nfor he was very valiant. He died to save us, my kinsman Meriadoc\nand myself, waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the Dark Lord;\nand though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.\u2019\nThen Pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred\nstrangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that"}

Men think much\nabout the stories of old days in Gondor; and Denethor has given\nlong thought to the rhyme and to the words Isildur\u2019s Bane, since\nBoromir went away.\n\u2018He is not as other men of this time, Pippin, and whatever be his\ndescent from father to son, by some chance the blood of Westernesse\nruns nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet\ndid not in Boromir whom he loved best. He has long sight. He can\nperceive, if he bends his will thither, much of what is passing in the\nminds of men, even of those that dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive\nhim, and dangerous to try.\n\u2018Remember that! For you are now sworn to his service. I do not\nknow what put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. But it\nwas well done. I did not hinder it, for generous deed should not be\nchecked by cold counsel. It touched his heart, as well (may I say it)\nas pleasing his humour. And at least you are free now to move about\nas you will in Minas Tirith \u2013 when you are not on duty. For there is\nanother side to it. You are at his command; and he will not forget.\nBe wary still!\u2019\nHe fell silent and sighed. \u2018Well, no need to brood on what\ntomorrow may bring. For one thing, tomorrow will be certain to\nbring worse than today, for many days to come. And there is nothing\nmore that I can do to help it. The board is set, and the pieces are"}
{"784": "had no time to gather news. I must go, Pippin. I must go to this\nlords\u2019 council and learn what I can. But the Enemy has the move,\nand he is about to open his full game. And pawns are likely to see\nas much of it as any, Peregrin son of Paladin, soldier of Gondor.\nSharpen your blade!\u2019\nGandalf went to the door, and there he turned. \u2018I am in haste,\nPippin,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do me a favour when you go out. Even before you\nrest, if you are not too weary. Go and find Shadowfax and see how\nhe is housed. These people are kindly to beasts, for they are a good\nand wise folk, but they have less skill with horses than some.\u2019\nWith that Gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note\nof a clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. Three strokes\nit rang, like silver in the air, and ceased: the third hour from the\nrising of the sun.\nAfter a minute Pippin went to the door and down the stair and\nlooked about the street. The sun was now shining warm and bright,\nand the towers and tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward.\nHigh in the blue air Mount Mindolluin lifted its white helm and\nsnowy cloak. Armed men went to and fro in the ways of the City, as\nif going at the striking of the hour to changes of post and duty.\n\u2018Nine o\u2019clock we\u2019d call it in the Shire,\u2019 said Pippin aloud to himself.\n\u2018Just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring\nsunshine. And how I should like breakfast! Do these people ever have\nit, or is it over? And when do they have dinner, and where?\u2019\nPresently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along\nthe narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. Pippin\nfelt lonely and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but\nhe had no need. The man came straight up to him.\n\u2018You are Peregrin the Halfling?\u2019 he said. \u2018I am told that you have\nbeen sworn to the service of the Lord and of the City. Welcome!\u2019\nHe held out his hand and Pippin took it.\n\u2018I am named Beregond son of Baranor. I have no duty this morn-\ning, and I have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and\nto tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to\nknow. And for my part, I would learn of you also. For never before\nhave we seen a halfling in this land and though we have heard rumour\nof them, little is said of them in any tale that we know. Moreover\nyou are a friend of Mithrandir. Do you know him well?\u2019\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I have known of him all my short life, as you\nmight say; and lately I have travelled far with him. But there is much\nto read in that book, and I cannot claim to have seen more than a"}
{"785": "\u2018Aragorn?\u2019 said Beregond. \u2018Who is he?\u2019\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 stammered Pippin, \u2018he was a man who went about with us.\nI think he is in Rohan now.\u2019\n\u2018You have been in Rohan, I hear. There is much that I would ask\nyou of that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have\nin its people. But I am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer\nwhat you would ask. What would you know, Master Peregrin?\u2019\n\u2018Er well,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018if I may venture to say so, rather a burning\nquestion in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all\nthat? I mean, what are the meal-times, if you understand me, and\nwhere is the dining-room, if there is one? And the inns? I looked,\nbut never a one could I see as we rode up, though I had been borne\nup by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes\nof wise and courtly men.\u2019\nBeregond looked at him gravely. \u2018An old campaigner, I see,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018They say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next\nhope of food and of drink; though I am not a travelled man myself.\nThen you have not yet eaten today?\u2019\n\u2018Well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018But no more\nthan a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your\nlord; but he racked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is\nhungry work.\u2019\nBeregond laughed. \u2018At the table small men may do the greater\ndeeds, we say. But you have broken your fast as well as any man in\nthe Citadel, and with greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower\nof guard and is now in posture of war. We rise ere the Sun, and take\na morsel in the grey light, and go to our duties at the opening hour.\nBut do not despair!\u2019 He laughed again, seeing the dismay in Pippin\u2019s\nface. \u2018Those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their\nstrength in the mid-morning. Then there is the nuncheon, at noon\nor after as duties allow; and men gather for the daymeal, and such\nmirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset.\n\u2018Come! We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment,\nand eat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.\u2019\n\u2018One moment!\u2019 said Pippin blushing. \u2018Greed, or hunger by your\ncourtesy, put it out of my mind. But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call\nhim, asked me to see to his horse \u2013 Shadowfax, a great steed of\nRohan, and the apple of the king\u2019s eye, I am told, though he has\ngiven him to Mithrandir for his services. I think his new master loves\nthe beast better than he loves many men, and if his good will is of\nany value to this city, you will treat Shadowfax with all honour: with\ngreater kindness than you have treated this hobbit, if it is possible.\u2019"}
{"786": "\u2018I am glad to learn it,\u2019 said Beregond, \u2018for now I may say that\nstrange accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken\nfolk. But come! You shall make me acquainted with this good horse.\nI love beasts, and we see them seldom in this stony city; for my\npeople came from the mountain-vales, and before that from Ithilien.\nBut fear not! The visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and\nwe will go thence to the butteries.\u2019\nPippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended.\nFor in the sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were\nsome fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the\nlodgings of the errand-riders of the Lord: messengers always ready\nto go at the urgent command of Denethor or his chief captains. But\nnow all the horses and the riders were out and away.\nShadowfax whinnied as Pippin entered the stable and turned his\nhead. \u2018Good morning!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Gandalf will come as soon as\nhe may. He is busy, but he sends greetings, and I am to see that all\nis well with you; and you resting, I hope, after your long labours.\u2019\nShadowfax tossed his head and stamped. But he allowed Beregond\nto handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.\n\u2018He looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come\nfrom a great journey,\u2019 said Beregond. \u2018How strong and proud he is!\nWhere is his harness? It should be rich and fair.\u2019\n\u2018None is rich and fair enough for him,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018He will have\nnone. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not,\nwell, no bit, bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. Farewell, Shadow-\nfax! Have patience. Battle is coming.\u2019\nShadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook,\nand they covered their ears. Then they took their leave, seeing that\nthe manger was well filled.\n\u2018And now for our manger,\u2019 said Beregond, and he led Pippin back\nto the citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower.\nThere they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with\nlamps. There were hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these\nwas open.\n\u2018This is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the Guard,\u2019\nsaid Beregond. \u2018Greetings, Targon!\u2019 he called through the hatch. \u2018It\nis early yet, but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his\nservice. He has ridden long and far with a tight belt, and has had\nsore labour this morning, and he is hungry.

From there they could look out on the morning\nover the world.\nThey ate and drank; and they talked now of Gondor and its ways\nand customs, now of the Shire and the strange countries that Pippin\nhad seen. And ever as they talked Beregond was more amazed, and\nlooked with greater wonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as\nhe sat on the seat, or standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at\nthe lands below.\n\u2018I will not hide from you, Master Peregrin,\u2019 said Beregond, \u2018that\nto us you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers\nor so; and yet you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of\nour greybeards could boast of. I thought it was the whim of our Lord\nto take him a noble page, after the manner of the kings of old, they\nsay. But I see that it is not so, and you must pardon my foolishness.\u2019\n\u2018I do,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Though you are not far wrong. I am still little\nmore than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be\nfour years yet before I \u2018\u2018come of age\u2019\u2019, as we say in the Shire. But\ndo not bother about me. Come and look and tell me what I can see.\u2019\nThe sun was now climbing, and the mists in the vale below had\nbeen drawn up. The last of them were floating away, just overhead,\nas wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the East,\nthat was now flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of\nthe citadel. Away down in the valley-bottom, five leagues or so as\nthe eye leaps, the Great River could now be seen grey and glittering,\ncoming out of the north-west, and bending in a mighty sweep south\nand west again, till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer, far\nbeyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away.\nPippin could see all the Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into\nthe distance with farmsteads and little walls, barns and byres, but\nnowhere could he see any kine or other beasts. Many roads and tracks\ncrossed the green fields, and there was much coming and going:\nwains moving in lines towards the Great Gate, and others passing\nout. Now and again a horseman would ride up, and leap from the\nsaddle and hasten into the City. But most of the traffic went out\nalong the chief highway, and that turned south, and then bending\nswifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from sight.\nIt was wide and well-paved, and along its eastern edge ran a broad\ngreen riding-track, and beyond that a wall.

They must all\nbe gone from the Gate and the road clear for a league before noon:\nthat was the order. It is a sad necessity.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018Few, maybe, of\nthose now sundered will meet again. And there were always too few\nchildren in this city; but now there are none \u2013 save some young lads\nthat will not depart, and may find some task to do: my own son is\none of them.\u2019\nThey fell silent for a while. Pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if\nat any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the\nfields. \u2018What can I see there?\u2019 he asked, pointing down to the middle\nof the great curve of the Anduin. \u2018Is that another city, or what is it?\u2019\n\u2018It was a city,\u2019 said Beregond, \u2018the chief city of Gondor, of which\nthis was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath on either\nside of Anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet\nwe won it back in the days of the youth of Denethor: not to dwell\nin, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage\nof our arms. And then came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.\u2019\n\u2018The Black Riders?\u2019 said Pippin, opening his eyes, and they were\nwide and dark with an old fear re-awakened.\n\u2018Yes, they were black,\u2019 said Beregond, \u2018and I see that you know\nsomething of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of\nyour tales.\u2019\n\u2018I know of them,\u2019 said Pippin softly, \u2018but I will not speak of them\nnow, so near, so near.\u2019 He broke off and lifted his eyes above the\nRiver, and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and\nthreatening shadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge\nof sight, their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of\nmisty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and beyond that again a\nyet deeper gloom. But even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that\nthe gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, slowly rising to\nsmother the regions of the sun.\n\u2018So near to Mordor?\u2019 said Beregond quietly. \u2018Yes, there it lies. We\nseldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow:\nsometimes it seems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and\ndarker. It is growing and darkening now; and therefore our fear and\ndisquietgrowtoo.AndtheFellRiders,lessthanayearagotheywon"}
{"789": "we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. For a little while. But we\nawait now a new onslaught there. Maybe the chief onslaught of the\nwar that comes.\u2019\n\u2018When?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Have you a guess? For I saw the beacons\ntwo nights ago and the errand-riders; and Gandalf said that it was a\nsign that war had begun. He seemed in a desperate hurry. But now\neverything seems to have slowed up again.\u2019\n\u2018Only because everything is now ready,\u2019 said Beregond. \u2018It is but\nthe deep breath before the plunge.\u2019\n\u2018But why were the beacons lit two nights ago?\u2019\n\u2018It is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged,\u2019\nanswered Beregond. \u2018But I do not know the counsel of the Lord and\nhis captains. They have many ways of gathering news. And the Lord\nDenethor is unlike other men: he sees far. Some say that as he sits\nalone in his high chamber in the Tower at night, and bends his\nthought this way and that, he can read somewhat of the future; and\nthat he will at times search even the mind of the Enemy, wrestling\nwith him. And so it is that he is old, worn before his time. But\nhowever that may be, my lord Faramir is abroad, beyond the River\non some perilous errand, and he may have sent tidings.\n\u2018But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze, it was\nthe news that came that eve out of Lebennin. There is a great fleet\ndrawing near to the mouths of Anduin, manned by the corsairs of\nUmbar in the South. They have long ceased to fear the might of\nGondor, and they have allied them with the Enemy, and now make a\nheavy stroke in his cause. For this attack will draw off much of the help\nthat we looked to have from Lebennin and Belfalas, where folk are\nhardy and numerous. All the more do our thoughts go north to Rohan;\nand the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you bring.\n\u2018And yet\u2019 \u2013 he paused and stood up, and looked round, north,\neast, and south \u2013 \u2018the doings at Isengard should warn us that we are\ncaught now in a great net and strategy. This is no longer a bickering\nat the fords, raiding from Ithilien and from Ano\u00b4 rien, ambushing and\npillaging. This is a great war long-planned, and we are but one piece\nin it, whatever pride may say. Things move in the far East beyond\nthe Inland Sea, it is reported; and north in Mirkwood and beyond;\nand south in Harad. And now all realms shall be put to the test, to\nstand, or fall \u2013 under the Shadow.\n\u2018Yet, Master Peregrin, we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt\nof the chief hatred of the Dark Lord, for that hatred comes down\nout of the depths of time and over the deeps of the Sea.

{"790": "Pippin did not answer. He looked at the great walls, and the towers\nand brave banners, and the sun in the high sky, and then at the\ngathering gloom in the East; and he thought of the long fingers of\nthat Shadow: of the orcs in the woods and the mountains, the treason\nof Isengard, the birds of evil eye, and the Black Riders even in the\nlanes of the Shire \u2013 and of the winged terror, the Nazgu\u02c6l. He shud-\ndered, and hope seemed to wither. And even at that moment the sun\nfor a second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark wing had\npassed across it. Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high\nand far up in the heavens, a cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and\ncold. He blanched and cowered against the wall.\n\u2018What was that?\u2019 asked Beregond. \u2018You also felt something?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 muttered Pippin. \u2018It is the sign of our fall, and the shadow\nof doom, a Fell Rider of the air.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, the shadow of doom,\u2019 said Beregond. \u2018I fear that Minas\nTirith shall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems\nstolen away.\u2019\nFor a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak.\nThen suddenly Pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining\nand the banners still streaming in the breeze. He shook himself. \u2018It\nis passed,\u2019 he said. \u2018No, my heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell\nand has returned and is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg,\nor at least be left still upon our knees.\u2019\n\u2018Rightly said!\u2019 cried Beregond, rising and striding to and fro. \u2018Nay,\nthough all things must come utterly to an end in time, Gondor shall\nnot perish yet. Not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that\nwill build a hill of carrion before them. There are still other fastnesses,\nand secret ways of escape into the mountains. Hope and memory\nshall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green.\u2019\n\u2018All the same, I wish it was over for good or ill,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I\nam no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting\non the edge of one that I can\u2019t escape is worst of all. What a long\nday it seems already! I should be happier, if we were not obliged to\nstand and watch, making no move, striking nowhere first. No stroke\nwould have been struck in Rohan, I think, but for Gandalf.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!\u2019 said\nBeregond. \u2018But things may change when Faramir returns. He is bold,\nmore bold than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe\nthat a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song,\nas he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field.\nBut such is Faramir. Less reckless and eager than Boromir, but not"}
{"791": "cannot strike till some foe comes within it. Then our hand must be\nheavy!\u2019 He smote the hilt of his sword.\nPippin looked at him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men\nthat he had yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he\nthought of the battle. \u2018Alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather,\u2019\nhe thought, but he said nothing. \u2018A pawn did Gandalf say? Perhaps;\nbut on the wrong chessboard.\u2019\nSo they talked until the sun reached its height, and suddenly the\nnoon-bells were rung, and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save\nthe watchmen were going to their meal.\n\u2018Will you come with me?\u2019 said Beregond. \u2018You may join my mess\nfor this day. I do not know to what company you will be assigned;\nor the Lord may hold you at his own command. But you will be\nwelcome. And it will be well to meet as many men as you may, while\nthere is yet time.\u2019\n\u2018I shall be glad to come,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I am lonely, to tell you the\ntruth. I left my best friend behind in Rohan, and I have had no one\nto talk to or jest with. Perhaps I could really join your company? Are\nyou the captain? If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?\u2019\n\u2018Nay, nay,\u2019 Beregond laughed, \u2018I am no captain. Neither office\nnor rank nor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the\nThird Company of the Citadel. Yet, Master Peregrin, to be only a\nman of arms of the Guard of the Tower of Gondor is held worthy\nin the City, and such men have honour in the land.\u2019\n\u2018Then it is far beyond me,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Take me back to our\nroom, and if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like \u2013 as your\nguest.\u2019\nGandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so Pippin\nwent with Beregond and was made known to the men of the Third\nCompany. And it seemed that Beregond got as much honour from\nit as his guest, for Pippin was very welcome. There had already been\nmuch talk in the citadel about Mithrandir\u2019s companion and his long\ncloseting with the Lord; and rumour declared that a Prince of the\nHalflings had come out of the North to offer allegiance to Gondor\nand five thousand swords. And some said that when the Riders came\nfrom Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small\nmaybe, but doughty.\nThough Pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he\ncould not be rid of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to one\nbefriended by Boromir and honoured by the Lord Denethor; and"}

The day was\nstill fine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for March,\neven so far southwards. Pippin felt sleepy, but the lodging seemed\ncheerless, and he decided to go down and explore the City. He took a\nfew morsels that he had saved to Shadowfax, and they were graciously\naccepted, though the horse seemed to have no lack. Then he walked\non down many winding ways.\nPeople stared much as he passed. To his face men were gravely\ncourteous, saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head\nand hands upon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls, as\nthose out of doors cried to others within to come and see the Prince\nof the Halflings, the companion of Mithrandir. Many used some\nother tongue than the Common Speech, but it was not long before\nhe learned at least what was meant by Ernil i Pheriannath and knew\nthat his title had gone down before him into the City.\nHe came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pave-\nments to the lowest and widest circle, and there he was directed to\nthe Lampwrights\u2019 Street, a broad way running towards the Great\nGate. In it he found the Old Guesthouse, a large building of grey\nweathered stone with two wings running back from the street, and\nbetween them a narrow greensward, behind which was the many-\nwindowed house, fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch\nand a flight of steps down on to the grass. Boys were playing among\nthe pillars, the only children that Pippin had seen in Minas Tirith,\nand he stopped to look at them. Presently one of them caught sight\nof him, and with a shout he sprang across the grass and came into\nthe street, followed by several others.

But then my father is a Guard,\none of the tallest. What is your father?\u2019\n\u2018Which question shall I answer first?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018My father farms\nthe lands round Whitwell near Tuckborough in the Shire. I am nearly\ntwenty-nine, so I pass you there; though I am but four feet, and not\nlikely to grow any more, save sideways.\u2019\n\u2018Twenty-nine!\u2019 said the lad and whistled. \u2018Why, you are quite old!\nAs old as my uncle Iorlas. Still,\u2019 he added hopefully, \u2018I wager I could\nstand you on your head or lay you on your back.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe you could, if I let you,\u2019 said Pippin with a laugh. \u2018And\nmaybe I could do the same to you: we know some wrestling tricks\nin my little country. Where, let me tell you, I am considered uncom-\nmonly large and strong; and I have never allowed anyone to stand\nme on my head. So if it came to a trial and nothing else would serve,\nI might have to kill you. For when you are older, you will learn that\nfolk are not always what they seem; and though you may have taken\nme for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey, let me warn you: I am not,\nI am a halfling, hard, bold, and wicked!\u2019 Pippin pulled such a grim\nface that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he returned with\nclenched fists and the light of battle in his eye.\n\u2018No!\u2019 Pippin laughed. \u2018Don\u2019t believe what strangers say of them-\nselves either! I am not a fighter. But it would be politer in any case\nfor the challenger to say who he is.\u2019\nThe boy drew himself up proudly. \u2018I am Bergil son of Beregond\nof the Guards,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018So I thought,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018for you look like your father. I know\nhim and he sent me to find you.\u2019\n\u2018Then why did you not say so at once?\u2019 said Bergil, and suddenly\na look of dismay came over his face. \u2018Do not tell me that he has\nchanged his mind, and will send me away with the maidens! But no,\nthe last wains have gone.\u2019\n\u2018His message is less bad than that, if not good,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018He\nsays that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head, you might\nshow me round the City for a while and cheer my loneliness. I can\ntell you some tales of far countries in return.\u2019\nBergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. \u2018All is well,\u2019 he\ncried. \u2018Come then! We were soon going to the Gate to look on. We\nwill go now.\u2019\n\u2018What is happening there?\u2019\n\u2018The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Road"}
{"794": "Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had\nsince he parted from Merry, and soon they were laughing and talking\ngaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances\nthat men gave them. Before long they found themselves in a throng\ngoing towards the Great Gate. There Pippin went up much in the\nesteem of Bergil, for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the\nguard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more,\nhe allowed him to take his companion with him.\n\u2018That is good!\u2019 said Bergil. \u2018We boys are no longer allowed to pass\nthe Gate without an elder. Now we shall see better.\u2019\nBeyond the Gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the\nroad and of the great paved space into which all the ways to Minas\nTirith ran. All eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur\nrose: \u2018There is dust away there! They are coming!\u2019\nPippin and Bergil edged their way forward to the front of the\ncrowd, and waited. Horns sounded at some distance, and the noise\nof cheering rolled towards them like a gathering wind. Then there\nwas a loud trumpet-blast, and all about them people were shouting.\n\u2018Forlong! Forlong!\u2019 Pippin heard men calling. \u2018What do they say?\u2019\nhe asked.\n\u2018Forlong has come,\u2019 Bergil answered; \u2018old Forlong the Fat, the\nLord of Lossarnach. That is where my grandsire lives. Hurrah! Here\nhe is. Good old Forlong!\u2019\nLeading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse,\nand on it sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and\ngrey-bearded, yet mail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long\nheavy spear. Behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men, well-\narmed and bearing great battle-axes; grim-faced they were, and\nshorter and somewhat swarthier than any men that Pippin had yet\nseen in Gondor.\n\u2018Forlong!\u2019 men shouted. \u2018True heart, true friend! Forlong!\u2019 But\nwhen the men of Lossarnach had passed they muttered: \u2018So few!\nTwo hundreds, what are they? We hoped for ten times the number.\nThat will be the new tidings of the black fleet. They are sparing only\na tithe of their strength. Still every little is a gain.\u2019\nAnd so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and\npassed through the Gate, men of the Outlands marching to defend\nthe City of Gondor in a dark hour; but always too few, always less\nthan hope looked for or need asked.

Fisher-folk of the Ethir, some hun-\ndred or more spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green\nHills from Pinnath Gelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad\nmen. And last and proudest, Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, kinsman\nof the Lord, with gilded banners bearing his token of the Ship and\nthe Silver Swan, and a company of knights in full harness riding grey\nhorses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms, tall as lords,\ngrey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came.\nAnd that was all, less than three thousands full told. No more\nwould come. Their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the\nCity and died away. The onlookers stood silent for a while. Dust\nhung in the air, for the wind had died and the evening was heavy.\nAlready the closing hour was drawing nigh, and the red sun had gone\nbehind Mindolluin. Shadow came down on the City.\nPippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown\nashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light\ncame dully through it. But in the West the dying sun had set all the\nfume on fire, and now Mindolluin stood black against a burning\nsmoulder flecked with embers. \u2018So ends a fair day in wrath!\u2019 he said,\nforgetful of the lad at his side.\n\u2018So it will, if I have not returned before the sundown-bells,\u2019 said\nBergil. \u2018Come! There goes the trumpet for the closing of the Gate.\u2019\nHand in hand they went back into the City, the last to pass the\nGate before it was shut; and as they reached the Lampwrights\u2019 Street\nall the bells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights sprang in many\nwindows, and from the houses and wards of the men at arms along\nthe walls there came the sound of song.\n\u2018Farewell for this time,\u2019 said Bergil. \u2018Take my greetings to my\nfather, and thank him for the company that he sent. Come again\nsoon, I beg. Almost I wish now that there was no war, for we might\nhave had some merry times. We might have journeyed to Lossarnach,\nto my grandsire\u2019s house; it is good to be there in spring, the woods\nand fields are full of flowers. But maybe we will go thither together\nyet. They will never overcome our Lord, and my father is very valiant.\nFarewell and return!\u2019\nThey parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel. It\nseemed a long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night\nclosed down swift and dark. Not a star pricked the sky. He was late\nfor the daymeal in the mess, and Beregond greeted him gladly,"}
{"796": "was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf again.\n\u2018Can you find your way?\u2019 said Beregond at the door of the small\nhall, on the north side of the citadel, where they had sat. \u2018It is a black\nnight, and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be\ndimmed within the City, and none are to shine out from the walls.\nAnd I can give you news of another order: you will be summoned to\nthe Lord Denethor early tomorrow. I fear you will not be for the\nThird Company. Still we may hope to meet again. Farewell and sleep\nin peace!\u2019\nThe lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table.\nGandalf was not there. Gloom settled still more heavily on Pippin.\nHe climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it\nwas like looking into a pool of ink. He got down and closed the\nshutter and went to bed. For a while he lay and listened for sounds\nof Gandalf \u2019s return, and then he fell into an uneasy sleep.\nIn the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that Gandalf\nhad come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain\nof the alcove. There were candles on the table and rolls of parchment.\nHe heard the wizard sigh, and mutter: \u2018When will Faramir return?\u2019\n\u2018Hullo!\u2019 said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain. \u2018I thought\nyou had forgotten all about me. I am glad to see you back. It has\nbeen a long day.\u2019\n\u2018But the night will be too short,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I have come back\nhere, for I must have a little peace, alone. You should sleep, in a bed\nwhile you still may. At the sunrise I shall take you to the Lord\nDenethor again. No, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. The\nDarkness has begun. There will be no dawn.\u2019"}
{"797": "Chapter 2\nTHE PASSING OF THE\nGREY COMPANY\nGandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost\nin the night, when Merry came back to Aragorn. He had only a light\nbundle, for he had lost his pack at Parth Galen, and all he had was\na few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of Isengard.\nHasufel was already saddled. Legolas and Gimli with their horse\nstood close by.\n\u2018So four of the Company still remain,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We will ride\non together. But we shall not go alone, as I thought. The king is now\ndetermined to set out at once. Since the coming of the winged\nshadow, he desires to return to the hills under cover of night.\u2019\n\u2018And then whither?\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018I cannot say yet,\u2019 Aragorn answered. \u2018As for the king, he will go\nto the muster that he commanded at Edoras, four nights from now.\nAnd there, I think, he will hear tidings of war, and the Riders of\nRohan will go down to Minas Tirith. But for myself, and any that\nwill go with me...\u2019\n\u2018I for one!\u2019 cried Legolas. \u2018And Gimli with him!\u2019 said the Dwarf.\n\u2018Well, for myself,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018it is dark before me. I must go\ndown also to Minas Tirith, but I do not yet see the road. An hour\nlong prepared approaches.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t leave me behind!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I have not been of much\nuse yet; but I don\u2019t want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called\nfor when all is over. I don\u2019t think the Riders will want to be bothered\nwith me now. Though, of course, the king did say that I was to sit\nby him when he came to his house and tell him all about the Shire.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018and your road lies with him, I think, Merry.\nBut do not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere\nThe\u00b4oden sits at ease again in Meduseld. Many hopes will wither in\nthis bitter Spring.\u2019\nSoon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with Gimli\nbehind Legolas, and Merry in front of Aragorn. Presently they were\nriding swiftly through the night. They had not long passed the\nmounds at the Fords of Isen, when a Rider galloped up from the"}
{"798": "we crossed the fords I thought that I heard them. Now we are sure.\nThey are overtaking us, riding hard.\u2019\nThe\u00b4oden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized\ntheir spears. Aragorn dismounted and set Merry on the ground, and\ndrawing his sword he stood by the king\u2019s stirrup. E\u00b4omer and his\nesquire rode back to the rear. Merry felt more like unneeded baggage\nthan ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do.\nSupposing the king\u2019s small escort was trapped and overcome, but he\nescaped into the darkness \u2013 alone in the wild fields of Rohan with\nno idea of where he was in all the endless miles? \u2018No good!\u2019 he\nthought. He drew his sword and tightened his belt.\nThe sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but\nsuddenly it rode out clear again. Then they all heard the sound of\nhoofs, and at the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly\non the path from the fords. The moonlight glinted here and there\non the points of spears. The number of the pursuers could not be\ntold, but they seemed no fewer than the king\u2019s escort, at the least.\nWhen they were some fifty paces off, E\u00b4 omer cried in a loud voice:\n\u2018Halt! Halt! Who rides in Rohan?\u2019\nThe pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand. A silence\nfollowed; and then in the moonlight, a horseman could be seen dis-\nmounting and walking slowly forward. His hand showed white as he\nheld it up, palm outward, in token of peace; but the king\u2019s men\ngripped their weapons. At ten paces the man stopped. He was tall,\na dark standing shadow. Then his clear voice rang out.\n\u2018Rohan? Rohan did you say? That is a glad word. We seek that\nland in haste from long afar.\u2019\n\u2018You have found it,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018When you crossed the fords\nyonder you entered it. But it is the realm of The\u00b4oden the King. None\nride here save by his leave. Who are you? And what is your haste?\u2019\n\u2018Halbarad Du\u00b4nadan, Ranger of the North I am,\u2019 cried the man.\n\u2018We seek one Aragorn son of Arathorn, and we heard that he was in\nRohan.\u2019\n\u2018And you have found him also!\u2019 cried Aragorn. Giving his reins to\nMerry, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. \u2018Halbarad!\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018Of all joys this is the least expected!\u2019\nMerry breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some\nlast trick of Saruman\u2019s, to waylay the king while he had only a few\nmen about him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in\nThe\u00b4oden\u2019s defence, not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword.\n\u2018All is well,\u2019 said Aragorn, turning back. \u2018Here are some of my\nown kin from the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and"}
{"799": "that could be gathered in haste; but the brethren Elladan and Elrohir\nhave ridden with us, desiring to go to the war. We rode as swiftly as\nwe might when your summons came.\u2019\n\u2018But I did not summon you,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018save only in wish. My\nthoughts have often turned to you, and seldom more than tonight;\nyet I have sent no word. But come! All such matters must wait. You\nfind us riding in haste and danger. Ride with us now, if the king will\ngive his leave.\u2019\nThe\u00b4oden was indeed glad of the news. \u2018It is well!\u2019 he said. \u2018If these\nkinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord Aragorn, thirty such\nknights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.\u2019\nThen the Riders set out again, and Aragorn for a while rode with\nthe Du\u00b4nedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the North\nand in the South, Elrohir said to him:\n\u2018I bring word to you from my father: The days are short. If thou art\nin haste, remember the Paths of the Dead.\u2019\n\u2018Always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my\ndesire,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018But great indeed will be my haste ere I\ntake that road.\u2019\n\u2018That will soon be seen,\u2019 said Elrohir. \u2018But let us speak no more\nof these things upon the open road!\u2019\nAnd Aragorn said to Halbarad: \u2018What is that that you bear, kins-\nman?\u2019 For he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it\nwere a standard, but it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about\nwith many thongs.\n\u2018It is a gift that I bring you from the Lady of Rivendell,\u2019 answered\nHalbarad. \u2018She wrought it in secret, and long was the making. But\nshe also sends word to you: The days now are short. Either our hope\ncometh, or all hope\u2019s end. Therefore I send thee what I have made for thee.\nFare well, Elfstone!\u2019\nAnd Aragorn said: \u2018Now I know what you bear. Bear it still for\nme a while!\u2019 And he turned and looked away to the North under the\ngreat stars, and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night\u2019s\njourney lasted.\nThe night was old and the East grey when they rode up at last\nfrom Deeping-coomb and came back to the Hornburg. There they\nwere to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel.\nMerry slept until he was roused by Legolas and Gimli. \u2018The Sun\nis high,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018All others are up and doing. Come, Master\nSluggard, and look at this place while you may!\u2019"}
{"800": "and see how it was! And there are caves, Merry, caves of wonder!\nShall we visit them, Legolas, do you think?\u2019\n\u2018Nay! There is no time,\u2019 said the Elf. \u2018Do not spoil the wonder\nwith haste! I have given you my word to return hither with you, if a\nday of peace and freedom comes again. But it is now near to noon,\nand at that hour we eat, and then set out again, I hear.\u2019\nMerry got up and yawned. His few hours\u2019 sleep had not been\nnearly enough; he was tired and rather dismal. He missed Pippin,\nand felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans\nfor speed in a business that he did not fully understand. \u2018Where is\nAragorn?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018In a high chamber of the Burg,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018He has neither\nrested nor slept, I think. He went thither some hours ago, saying that\nhe must take thought, and only his kinsman, Halbarad, went with\nhim; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.\u2019\n\u2018They are a strange company, these newcomers,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Stout\nmen and lordly they are, and the Riders of Rohan look almost as\nboys beside them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered\nrocks for the most part, even as Aragorn himself; and they are silent.\u2019\n\u2018But even as Aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence,\u2019\nsaid Legolas. \u2018And have you marked the brethren Elladan and\nElrohir? Less sombre is their gear than the others\u2019, and they are fair\nand gallant as Elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the\nsons of Elrond of Rivendell.\u2019\n\u2018Why have they come? Have you heard?\u2019 asked Merry. He had\nnow dressed, and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and\nthe three passed out together towards the ruined gate of the Burg.\n\u2018They answered a summons, as you heard,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Word\ncame to Rivendell, they say: Aragorn has need of his kindred. Let the\nDu\u00b4nedain ride to him in Rohan! But whence this message came they\nare now in doubt. Gandalf sent it, I would guess.\u2019\n\u2018Nay, Galadriel,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Did she not speak through Gandalf\nof the ride of the Grey Company from the North?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, you have it,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018The Lady of the Wood! She read\nmany hearts and desires. Now why did not we wish for some of our\nown kinsfolk, Legolas?\u2019\nLegolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away\nnorth and east, and his fair face was troubled. \u2018I do not think that\nany would come,\u2019 he answered. \u2018They have no need to ride to war;\nwar already marches on their own lands.\u2019\nFor a while the three companions walked together, speaking of"}
{"801": "the road, until they stood on Helm\u2019s Dike and looked into the\nCoomb. The Death Down already stood there, black and tall and\nstony, and the great trampling and scoring of the grass by the Huorns\ncould be plainly seen. The Dunlendings and many men of the garri-\nson of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about\nthe battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary\nvalley resting after a great storm. Soon they turned back and went\nto the midday meal in the hall of the Burg.\nThe king was already there, and as soon as they entered he called\nfor Merry and had a seat set for him at his side. \u2018It is not as I would\nhave it,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden; \u2018for this is little like my fair house in Edoras.\nAnd your friend is gone, who should also be here. But it may be long\nere we sit, you and I, at the high table in Meduseld; there will be no\ntime for feasting when I return thither. But come now! Eat and drink,\nand let us speak together while we may. And then you shall ride with\nme.\u2019\n\u2018May I?\u2019 said Merry, surprised and delighted. \u2018That would be\nsplendid!\u2019 He had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words.\n\u2018I am afraid I am only in everybody\u2019s way,\u2019 he stammered; \u2018but I\nshould like to do anything I could, you know.\u2019\n\u2018I doubt it not,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I have had a good hill-pony made\nready for you. He will bear you as swift as any horse by the roads\nthat we shall take. For I will ride from the Burg by mountain paths,\nnot by the plain, and so come to Edoras by way of Dunharrow where\nthe Lady E\u00b4 owyn awaits me. You shall be my esquire, if you will. Is\nthere gear of war in this place, E\u00b4 omer, that my sword-thain could\nuse?\u2019\n\u2018There are no great weapon-hoards here, lord,\u2019 answered E\u00b4 omer.\n\u2018Maybe a light helm might be found to fit him; but we have no mail\nor sword for one of his stature.\u2019\n\u2018I have a sword,\u2019 said Merry, climbing from his seat, and drawing\nfrom its black sheath his small bright blade. Filled suddenly with love\nfor this old man, he knelt on one knee, and took his hand and kissed\nit. \u2018May I lay the sword of Meriadoc of the Shire on your lap, The\u00b4oden\nKing?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Receive my service, if you will!\u2019\n\u2018Gladly will I take it,\u2019 said the king; and laying his long old hands\nupon the brown hair of the hobbit, he blessed him. \u2018Rise now, Meria-\ndoc, esquire of Rohan of the household of Meduseld!\u2019 he said. \u2018Take\nyour sword and bear it unto good fortune!\u2019\n\u2018As a father you shall be to me,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018For a little while,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden."}
{"802": "bid men sound the horns? But where is Aragorn? His place is empty\nand he has not eaten.\u2019\n\u2018We will make ready to ride,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden; \u2018but let word be sent\nto the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.\u2019\nThe king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from\nthe gate of the Burg to where the Riders were assembling on the\ngreen. Many were already mounted. It would be a great company;\nfor the king was leaving only a small garrison in the Burg, and all\nwho could be spared were riding to the weapontake at Edoras. A\nthousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night; but still\nthere would be some five hundred more to go with the king, for the\nmost part men from the fields and dales of Westfold.\nA little apart the Rangers sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed\nwith spear and bow and sword. They were clad in cloaks of dark\ngrey, and their hoods were cast now over helm and head. Their horses\nwere strong and of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood\nthere without a rider, Aragorn\u2019s own horse that they had brought\nfrom the North; Roheryn was his name. There was no gleam of stone\nor gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness; nor did their\nriders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned\nupon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star.\nThe king mounted his horse, Snowmane, and Merry sat beside\nhim on his pony: Stybba was his name. Presently E\u00b4omer came out\nfrom the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the\ngreat staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor\nold. So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell\nthem apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad\nalike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them walked\nLegolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for Aragorn, so startling\nwas the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had\nfallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary.\n\u2018I am troubled in mind, lord,\u2019 he said, standing by the king\u2019s horse.\n\u2018I have heard strange words, and I see new perils far off. I have\nlaboured long in thought, and now I fear that I must change my\npurpose. Tell me, The\u00b4oden, you ride now to Dunharrow, how long\nwill it be ere you come there?\u2019\n\u2018It is now a full hour past noon,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018Before the night of\nthe third day from now we should come to the Hold. The Moon will\nthen be two nights past his full, and the muster that the king com-\nmanded will be held the day after. More speed we cannot make, if\nthe strength of Rohan is to be gathered.\u2019\nAragorn was silent for a moment. \u2018Three days,\u2019 he murmured,"}
{"803": "some decision; his face was less troubled. \u2018Then, by your leave, lord,\nI must take new counsel for myself and my kindred. We must ride\nour own road, and no longer in secret. For me the time of stealth\nhas passed. I will ride east by the swiftest way, and I will take the\nPaths of the Dead.\u2019\n\u2018The Paths of the Dead!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden, and trembled. \u2018Why do\nyou speak of them?\u2019 E\u00b4omer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it\nseemed to Merry that the faces of the Riders that sat within hearing\nturned pale at the words. \u2018If there be in truth such paths,\u2019 said\nThe\u00b4oden, \u2018their gate is in Dunharrow; but no living man may pass\nit.\u2019\n\u2018Alas! Aragorn my friend!\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018I had hoped that we should\nride to war together; but if you seek the Paths of the Dead, then our\nparting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again\nunder the Sun.\u2019\n\u2018That road I will take, nonetheless,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But I say to\nyou, E\u00b4omer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the\nhosts of Mordor should stand between.\u2019\n\u2018You will do as you will, my lord Aragorn,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018It is\nyour doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This\nparting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now I must\ntake the mountain-roads and delay no longer. Farewell!\u2019\n\u2018Farewell, lord!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Ride unto great renown! Farewell,\nMerry! I leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we\nhunted the orcs to Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli will still hunt with\nme, I hope; but we shall not forget you.\u2019\n\u2018Good-bye!\u2019 said Merry. He could find no more to say. He felt\nvery small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy\nwords. More than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of\nPippin. The Riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he\nwished they would start and get it over.\nNow The\u00b4oden spoke to E\u00b4omer, and he lifted up his hand and\ncried aloud, and with that word the Riders set forth. They rode over\nthe Dike and down the Coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards,\nthey took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until\nbending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from\nview. Aragorn rode to the Dike and watched till the king\u2019s men were\nfar down the Coomb. Then he turned to Halbarad.\n\u2018There go three that I love, and the smallest not the least,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018He knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would\ngo on.\u2019\n\u2018Alittlepeople,butofgreatwortharetheShire-folk,\u2019saidHalba-"}
{"804": "\u2018And now our fates are woven together,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018And yet,\nalas! here we must part. Well, I must eat a little, and then we also\nmust hasten away. Come, Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you\nas I eat.\u2019\nTogether they went back into the Burg; yet for some time Aragorn\nsat silent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to\nspeak. \u2018Come!\u2019 said Legolas at last. \u2018Speak and be comforted, and\nshake off the shadow! What has happened since we came back to\nthis grim place in the grey morning?\u2019\n\u2018A struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the\nHornburg,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018I have looked in the Stone of\nOrthanc, my friends.\u2019\n\u2018You have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry!\u2019 exclaimed\nGimli with fear and astonishment in his face. \u2018Did you say aught to\n\u2013 him? Even Gandalf feared that encounter.\u2019\n\u2018You forget to whom you speak,\u2019 said Aragorn sternly, and his\neyes glinted. \u2018What do you fear that I should say to him? Did I not\nopenly proclaim my title before the doors of Edoras? Nay, Gimli,\u2019\nhe said in a softer voice, and the grimness left his face, and he looked\nlike one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights. \u2018Nay,\nmy friends, I am the lawful master of the Stone, and I had both the\nright and the strength to use it, or so I judged. The right cannot be\ndoubted. The strength was enough \u2013 barely.\u2019\nHe drew a deep breath. \u2018It was a bitter struggle, and the weariness\nis slow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched\nthe Stone to my own will. That alone he will find hard to endure.\nAnd he beheld me. Yes, Master Gimli, he saw me, but in other guise\nthan you see me here. If that will aid him, then I have done ill. But\nI do not think so. To know that I lived and walked the earth was a\nblow to his heart, I deem; for he knew it not till now. The eyes in\nOrthanc did not see through the armour of The\u00b4oden; but Sauron\nhas not forgotten Isildur and the sword of Elendil. Now in the very\nhour of his great designs the heir of Isildur and the Sword are revealed;\nfor I showed the blade re-forged to him. He is not so mighty yet that\nhe is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.\u2019\n\u2018But he wields great dominion, nonetheless,\u2019 said Gimli; \u2018and now\nhe will strike more swiftly.\u2019\n\u2018The hasty stroke goes oft astray,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018We must press\nour Enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. See my\nfriends, when I had mastered the Stone, I learned many things. A\ngrave peril I saw coming unlooked-for upon Gondor from the South\nthat will draw off great strength from the defence of Minas Tirith. If"}
{"805": "\u2018Then lost it must be,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018For what help is there to send\nthither, and how could it come there in time?\u2019\n\u2018I have no help to send, therefore I must go myself,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018But there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me\nto the coastlands before all is lost. That is the Paths of the Dead.\u2019\n\u2018The Paths of the Dead!\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018It is a fell name; and little\nto the liking to the Men of Rohan, as I saw. Can the living use such\na road and not perish? And even if you pass that way, what will so\nfew avail to counter the strokes of Mordor?\u2019\n\u2018The living have never used that road since the coming of the\nRohirrim,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018for it is closed to them. But in this dark\nhour the heir of Isildur may use it, if he dare. Listen! This is the\nword that the sons of Elrond bring to me from their father in Rivend-\nell, wisest in lore: Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the\nPaths of the Dead.\u2019\n\u2018And what may be the words of the seer?\u2019 said Legolas.\n\u2018Thus spoke Malbeth the Seer, in the days of Arvedui, last king\nat Fornost,\u2019 said Aragorn:\nOver the land there lies a long shadow,\nwestward reaching wings of darkness.\nThe Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings\ndoom approaches. The Dead awaken;\nfor the hour is come for the oathbreakers:\nat the Stone of Erech they shall stand again\nand hear there a horn in the hills ringing.\nWhose shall the horn be? Who shall call them\nfrom the grey twilight, the forgotten people?\nThe heir of him to whom the oath they swore.\nFrom the North shall he come, need shall drive him:\nhe shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.\n\u2018Dark ways, doubtless,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018but no darker than these staves\nare to me.\u2019\n\u2018If you would understand them better, then I bid you come with\nme,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018for that way I now shall take. But I do not go\ngladly; only need drives me. Therefore, only of your free will would\nI have you come, for you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe\nworse.\u2019\n\u2018I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever\nend they may lead,\u2019 said Gimli."}
{"806": "fight,\u2019 said Gimli; \u2018for otherwise I see not why we should trouble\nthem.\u2019\n\u2018That we shall know if ever we come to Erech,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But\nthe oath that they broke was to fight against Sauron, and they must\nfight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a\nblack stone that was brought, it was said, from Nu\u00b4menor by Isildur;\nand it was set upon a hill, and upon it the King of the Mountains\nswore allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of Gondor.\nBut when Sauron returned and grew in might again, Isildur sum-\nmoned the Men of the Mountains to fulfil their oath, and they would\nnot: for they had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years.\n\u2018Then Isildur said to their king: \u2018\u2018Thou shalt be the last king. And\nif the West prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay\nupon thee and thy folk: to rest never until your oath is fulfilled. For\nthis war will last through years uncounted, and you shall be sum-\nmoned once again ere the end.\u2019\u2019 And they fled before the wrath of\nIsildur, and did not dare to go forth to war on Sauron\u2019s part; and\nthey hid themselves in secret places in the mountains and had no\ndealings with other men, but slowly dwindled in the barren hills. And\nthe terror of the Sleepless Dead lies about the Hill of Erech and all\nplaces where that people lingered. But that way I must go, since there\nare none living to help me.\u2019\nHe stood up. \u2018Come!\u2019 he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed\nin the twilit hall of the Burg. \u2018To the Stone of Erech! I seek the Paths\nof the Dead. Come with me who will!\u2019\nLegolas and Gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed\nAragorn from the hall. On the green there waited, still and silent, the\nhooded Rangers. Legolas and Gimli mounted. Aragorn sprang upon\nRoheryn. Then Halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed\nin Helm\u2019s Deep: and with that they leapt away, riding down the\nCoomb like thunder, while all the men that were left on Dike or Burg\nstared in amaze.\nAnd while The\u00b4oden went by slow paths in the hills, the Grey\nCompany passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the\nafternoon they came to Edoras; and there they halted only briefly,\nere they passed up the valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness\nfell.\nThe Lady E\u00b4owyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for\nno mightier men had she seen than the Du\u00b4nedain and the fair sons\nof Elrond; but on Aragorn most of all her eyes rested.

{"807": "in Helm\u2019s Deep and the great slaughter of their foes, and of the\ncharge of The\u00b4oden and his knights, then her eyes shone.\nBut at last she said: \u2018Lords, you are weary and shall now go to\nyour beds with such ease as can be contrived in haste. But tomorrow\nfairer housing shall be found for you.\u2019\nBut Aragorn said: \u2018Nay, lady, be not troubled for us! If we may\nlie here tonight and break our fast tomorrow, it will be enough. For\nI ride on an errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning\nwe must go.\u2019\nShe smiled on him and said: \u2018Then it was kindly done, lord, to\nride so many miles out of your way to bring tidings to E\u00b4owyn, and\nto speak with her in her exile.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,\u2019 said Aragorn;\n\u2018and yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the\nroad which I must take leads me to Dunharrow.\u2019\nAnd she answered as one that likes not what is said: \u2018Then, lord,\nyou are astray; for out of Harrowdale no road runs east or south;\nand you had best return as you came.\u2019\n\u2018Nay, lady,\u2019 said he, \u2018I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere\nyou were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that\nroad I shall take. Tomorrow I shall ride by the Paths of the Dead.\u2019\nThen she stared at him as one that is stricken, and her face\nblanched, and for long she spoke no more, while all sat silent. \u2018But,\nAragorn,\u2019 she said at last, \u2018is it then your errand to seek death? For\nthat is all that you will find on that road. They do not suffer the\nliving to pass.\u2019\n\u2018They may suffer me to pass,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018but at the least I will\nadventure it. No other road will serve.\u2019\n\u2018But this is madness,\u2019 she said. \u2018For here are men of renown and\nprowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but should\nlead to war, where men are needed. I beg you to remain and ride\nwith my brother; for then all our hearts will be gladdened, and our\nhope be the brighter.\u2019\n\u2018It is not madness, lady,\u2019 he answered; \u2018for I go on a path\nappointed. But those who follow me do so of their free will; and if\nthey wish now to remain and ride with the Rohirrim, they may do\nso. But I shall take the Paths of the Dead, alone, if needs be.\u2019\nThen they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were\never upon Aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment\nof mind. At length they arose, and took their leave of the Lady, and\nthanked her for her care, and went to their rest.\nBut as Aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with"}
{"808": "a glimmer in the night, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were\non fire.\n\u2018Aragorn,\u2019 she said, \u2018why will you go on this deadly road?\u2019\n\u2018Because I must,\u2019 he said. \u2018Only so can I see any hope of doing\nmy part in the war against Sauron. I do not choose paths of peril,\nE\u00b4 owyn. Were I to go where my heart dwells, far in the North I would\nnow be wandering in the fair valley of Rivendell.\u2019\nFor a while she was silent, as if pondering what this might mean.\nThen suddenly she laid her hand on his arm. \u2018You are a stern lord\nand resolute,\u2019 she said; \u2018and thus do men win renown.\u2019 She paused.\n\u2018Lord,\u2019 she said, \u2018if you must go, then let me ride in your following.\nFor I am weary of skulking in the hills, and wish to face peril and\nbattle.\u2019\n\u2018Your duty is with your people,\u2019 he answered.\n\u2018Too often have I heard of duty,\u2019 she cried. \u2018But am I not of the\nHouse of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited\non faltering feet long enough. Since they falter no longer, it seems,\nmay I not now spend my life as I will?\u2019\n\u2018Few may do that with honour,\u2019 he answered. \u2018But as for you,\nlady: did you not accept the charge to govern the people until their\nlord\u2019s return? If you had not been chosen, then some marshal or\ncaptain would have been set in the same place, and he could not ride\naway from his charge, were he weary of it or no.\u2019\n\u2018Shall I always be chosen?\u2019 she said bitterly. \u2018Shall I always be left\nbehind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they win\nrenown, and find food and beds when they return?\u2019\n\u2018A time may come soon,\u2019 said he, \u2018when none will return. Then\nthere will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember\nthe deeds that are done in the last defence of your homes. Yet the\ndeeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.\u2019\nAnd she answered: \u2018All your words are but to say: you are a woman,\nand your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle\nand honour, you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men\nwill need it no more. But I am of the House of Eorl and not a\nserving-woman. I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either\npain or death.\u2019\n\u2018What do you fear, lady?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018A cage,\u2019 she said. \u2018To stay behind bars, until use and old age\naccept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond\nrecall or desire.\u2019\n\u2018And yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that I\nhad chosen, because it is perilous?\u2019"}
{"809": "and victory. I would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast\naway needlessly.\u2019\n\u2018Nor would I,\u2019 he said. \u2018Therefore I say to you, lady: Stay! For\nyou have no errand to the South.\u2019\n\u2018Neither have those others who go with thee. They go only because\nthey would not be parted from thee \u2013 because they love thee.\u2019 Then\nshe turned and vanished into the night.\nWhen the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not\nyet risen above the high ridges in the East, Aragorn made ready to\ndepart. His company was all mounted, and he was about to leap into\nthe saddle, when the Lady E\u00b4 owyn came to bid them farewell. She\nwas clad as a Rider and girt with a sword. In her hand she bore a\ncup, and she set it to her lips and drank a little, wishing them good\nspeed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn, and he drank, and he\nsaid: \u2018Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of your House,\nand of you, and of all your people. Say to your brother: beyond the\nshadows we may meet again!\u2019\nThen it seemed to Gimli and Legolas who were nearby that she\nwept, and in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous.\nBut she said: \u2018Aragorn, wilt thou go?\u2019\n\u2018I will,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as I have asked?\u2019\n\u2018I will not, lady,\u2019 he said. \u2018For that I could not grant without\nleave of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until\ntomorrow. But I count now every hour, indeed every minute.\nFarewell!\u2019\nThen she fell on her knees, saying: \u2018I beg thee!\u2019\n\u2018Nay, lady,\u2019 he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her.\nThen he kissed her hand, and sprang into the saddle, and rode away,\nand did not look back; and only those who knew him well and were\nnear to him saw the pain that he bore.\nBut E\u00b4owyn stood still as a figure carven in stone, her hands\nclenched at her sides, and she watched them until they passed into\nthe shadows under the black Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain,\nin which was the Door of the Dead. When they were lost to view,\nshe turned, stumbling as one that is blind, and went back to her\nlodging. But none of her folk saw this parting, for they hid themselves\nin fear and would not come forth until the day was up, and the\nreckless strangers were gone.\nAnd some said: \u2018They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they\nbelong, into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil"}
{"810": "The light was still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed\nover the black ridges of the Haunted Mountain before them. A dread\nfell on them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones\nand so came to the Dimholt. There under the gloom of black trees\nthat not even Legolas could long endure they found a hollow place\nopening at the mountain\u2019s root, and right in their path stood a single\nmighty stone like a finger of doom.\n\u2018My blood runs chill,\u2019 said Gimli, but the others were silent, and\nhis voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet. The horses\nwould not pass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted\nand led them about. And so they came at last deep into the glen;\nand there stood a sheer wall of rock, and in the wall the Dark Door\ngaped before them like the mouth of night. Signs and figures were\ncarved above its wide arch too dim to read, and fear flowed from it\nlike a grey vapour.\nThe Company halted, and there was not a heart among them that\ndid not quail, unless it were the heart of Legolas of the Elves, for\nwhom the ghosts of Men have no terror.\n\u2018This is an evil door,\u2019 said Halbarad, \u2018and my death lies beyond\nit. I will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.\u2019\n\u2018But we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,\u2019 said\nAragorn. \u2018For if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues\nlie beyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph\nof Sauron nearer. Follow me!\u2019\nThen Aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will\nin that hour that all the Du\u00b4nedain and their horses followed him.\nAnd indeed the love that the horses of the Rangers bore for their\nriders was so great that they were willing to face even the terror of\nthe Door, if their masters\u2019 hearts were steady as they walked beside\nthem. But Arod, the horse of Rohan, refused the way, and he stood\nsweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see. Then\nLegolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went\nsoft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and Legolas\npassed in. And there stood Gimli the Dwarf left all alone.\nHis knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. \u2018Here is a thing\nunheard of !\u2019 he said. \u2018An Elf will go underground and a Dwarf dare\nnot!\u2019 With that he plunged in. But it seemed to him that he dragged\nhis feet like lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came\nupon him, even upon Gimli Glo\u00b4 in\u2019s son who had walked unafraid\nin many deep places of the world.\nAragorn had brought torches from Dunharrow, and now he went"}
{"811": "nothing but the dim flame of the torches; but if the Company halted,\nthere seemed an endless whisper of voices all about him, a murmur\nof words in no tongue that he had ever heard before.\nNothing assailed the Company nor withstood their passage, and\nyet steadily fear grew on the Dwarf as he went on: most of all because\nhe knew now that there could be no turning back; all the paths behind\nwere thronged by an unseen host that followed in the dark.\nSo time unreckoned passed, until Gimli saw a sight that he was\never afterwards loth to recall. The road was wide, as far as he could\njudge, but now the Company came suddenly into a great empty\nspace, and there were no longer any walls upon either side. The dread\nwas so heavy on him that he could hardly walk. Away to the left\nsomething glittered in the gloom as Aragorn\u2019s torch drew near. Then\nAragorn halted and went to look what it might be.\n\u2018Does he feel no fear?\u2019 muttered the Dwarf. \u2018In any other cave\nGimli Glo\u00b4in\u2019s son would have been the first to run to the gleam of\ngold. But not here! Let it lie!\u2019\nNonetheless he drew near, and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Ella-\ndan held aloft both torches. Before him were the bones of a mighty\nman. He had been clad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole;\nfor the cavern\u2019s air was as dry as dust, and his hauberk was gilded.\nHis belt was of gold and garnets, and rich with gold was the helm\nupon his bony head face downward on the floor. He had fallen near\nthe far wall of the cave, as now could be seen, and before him stood\na stony door closed fast: his finger-bones were still clawing at the\ncracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he had hewn\nat the rock in his last despair.\nAragorn did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while\nhe rose and sighed. \u2018Hither shall the flowers of simbelmyne\u00a8 come never\nunto world\u2019s end,\u2019 he murmured. \u2018Nine mounds and seven there are\nnow green with grass, and through all the long years he has lain at\nthe door that he could not unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would\nhe pass? None shall ever know!\n\u2018For that is not my errand!\u2019 he cried, turning back and speaking to\nthe whispering darkness behind. \u2018Keep your hoards and your secrets\nhidden in the Accursed Years! Speed only we ask. Let us pass, and\nthen come! I summon you to the Stone of Erech!\u2019\nThere was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful\nthan the whispers before; and then a chill blast came in which the\ntorches flickered and went out, and could not be rekindled. Of the\ntime that followed, one hour or many, Gimli remembered little."}
{"812": "rumour came after him like the shadow-sound of many feet. He\nstumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the ground and\nfelt that he could endure no more: he must either find an ending and\nescape or run back in madness to meet the following fear.\nSuddenly he heard the tinkle of water, a sound hard and clear as\na stone falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light grew, and lo! the\nCompany passed through another gateway, high-arched and broad,\nand a rill ran out beside them; and beyond, going steeply down, was\na road between sheer cliffs, knife-edged against the sky far above. So\ndeep and narrow was that chasm that the sky was dark, and in it\nsmall stars glinted. Yet as Gimli after learned it was still two hours\nere sunset of the day on which they had set out from Dunharrow;\nthough for all that he could then tell it might have been twilight in\nsome later year, or in some other world.\nThe Company now mounted again, and Gimli returned to Leg-\nolas. They rode in file, and evening came on and a deep blue dusk;\nand still fear pursued them. Legolas turning to speak to Gimli looked\nback and the Dwarf saw before his face the glitter in the Elf \u2019s bright\neyes. Behind them rode Elladan, last of the Company, but not the\nlast of those that took the downward road.\n\u2018The Dead are following,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018I see shapes of Men and\nof horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like\nwinter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, the Dead ride behind. They have been summoned,\u2019 said\nElladan.\nThe Company came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as if\nthey had issued from a crack in a wall; and there lay the uplands of\na great vale before them, and the stream beside them went down\nwith a cold voice over many falls.\n\u2018Where in Middle-earth are we?\u2019 said Gimli; and Elladan answered:\n\u2018We have descended from the uprising of the Morthond, the long\nchill river that flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of Dol\nAmroth. You will not need to ask hereafter how comes its name:\nBlackroot men call it.\u2019\nThe Morthond Vale made a great bay that beat up against the\nsheer southern faces of the mountains. Its steep slopes were grass-\ngrown; but all was grey in that hour, for the sun had gone, and far\nbelow lights twinkled in the homes of Men. The vale was rich and\nmany folk dwelt there.\nThen without turning Aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear:"}

Ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night:\n\u2018The King of the Dead ! The King of the Dead is come upon us!\u2019\nBells were ringing far below, and all men fled before the face of\nAragorn; but the Grey Company in their haste rode like hunters,\nuntil their horses were stumbling with weariness. And thus, just ere\nmidnight, and in a darkness as black as the caverns in the mountains,\nthey came at last to the Hill of Erech.\nLong had the terror of the Dead lain upon that hill and upon the\nempty fields about it. For upon the top stood a black stone, round\nas a great globe, the height of a man, though its half was buried in\nthe ground. Unearthly it looked, as though it had fallen from the\nsky, as some believed; but those who remembered still the lore of\nWesternesse told that it had been brought out of the ruin of Nu\u00b4menor\nand there set by Isildur at his landing. None of the people of the\nvalley dared to approach it, nor would they dwell near; for they said\nthat it was a trysting-place of the Shadow-men and there they would\ngather in times of fear, thronging round the Stone and whispering.\nTo that Stone the Company came and halted in the dead of night.\nThen Elrohir gave to Aragorn a silver horn, and he blew upon it;\nand it seemed to those that stood near that they heard a sound of\nanswering horns, as if it was an echo in deep caves far away. No\nother sound they heard, and yet they were aware of a great host\ngathered all about the hill on which they stood; and a chill wind like\nthe breath of ghosts came down from the mountains. But Aragorn\ndismounted, and standing by the Stone he cried in a great voice:\n\u2018Oathbreakers, why have ye come?\u2019\nAnd a voice was heard out of the night that answered him, as if\nfrom far away:\n\u2018To fulfil our oath and have peace.\u2019\nThen Aragorn said: \u2018The hour is come at last. Now I go to Pelargir\nupon Anduin, and ye shall come after me. And when all this land is\nclean of the servants of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye\nshall have peace and depart for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur\u2019s heir\nof Gondor.\u2019\nAnd with that he bade Halbarad unfurl the great standard which\nhehadbrought;andbehold!itwasblack,andiftherewasanydevice"}

No other mortal Men could have\nendured it, none but the Du\u00b4 nedain of the North, and with them\nGimli the Dwarf and Legolas of the Elves.\nThey passed Tarlang\u2019s Neck and came into Lamedon; and the\nShadow Host pressed behind and fear went on before them, until\nthey came to Calembel upon Ciril, and the sun went down like blood\nbehind Pinnath Gelin away in the West behind them. The township\nand the fords of Ciril they found deserted, for many men had gone\naway to war, and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour of\nthe coming of the King of the Dead.

{"815": "Chapter 3\nTHE MUSTER OF ROHAN\nNow all roads were running together to the East to meet the coming\nof war and the onset of the Shadow. And even as Pippin stood at\nthe Great Gate of the City and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride\nin with his banners, the King of Rohan came down out of the hills.\nDay was waning. In the last rays of the sun the Riders cast long\npointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already\ncrept beneath the murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep moun-\ntain-sides. The king rode now slowly at the end of the day. Presently\nthe path turned round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plunged into\nthe gloom of soft-sighing trees. Down, down they went in a long\nwinding file. When at last they came to the bottom of the gorge they\nfound that evening had fallen in the deep places. The sun was gone.\nTwilight lay upon the waterfalls.\nAll day far below them a leaping stream had run down from\nthe high pass behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad\nwalls; and now through a stony gate it flowed out and passed into a\nwider vale. The Riders followed it, and suddenly Harrowdale lay\nbefore them, loud with the noise of waters in the evening. There\nthe white Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went rushing,\nfuming on the stones, down to Edoras and the green hills and the\nplains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty\nStarkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but\nits jagged peak, clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the\nworld, blue-shadowed upon the East, red-stained by the sunset in\nthe West.\nMerry looked out in wonder upon this strange country, of which\nhe had heard many tales upon their long road. It was a skyless world,\nin which his eye, through dim gulfs of shadowy air, saw only ever-\nmounting slopes, great walls of stone behind great walls, and frowning\nprecipices wreathed with mist. He sat for a moment half dreaming,\nlistening to the noise of water, the whisper of dark trees, the crack\nof stone, and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound.\nHe loved mountains, or he had loved the thought of them marching\non the edge of stories brought from far away; but now he was borne\ndown by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He longed to\nshut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire."}
{"816": "days he had jogged up and down, over passes, and through long dales,\nand across many streams. Sometimes where the way was broader he\nhad ridden at the king\u2019s side, not noticing that many of the Riders\nsmiled to see the two together: the hobbit on his little shaggy grey\npony, and the Lord of Rohan on his great white horse. Then he had\ntalked to The\u00b4oden, telling him about his home and the doings of the\nShire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark and its mighty\nmen of old. But most of the time, especially on this last day, Merry\nhad ridden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and trying\nto understand the slow sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the\nmen behind him using. It was a language in which there seemed to\nbe many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly\nthan in the Shire, yet he could not piece the words together. At times\nsome Rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and Merry\nfelt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.\nAll the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at\nthe day\u2019s end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin\nhad got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and\nGimli. Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of\nFrodo and Sam. \u2018I am forgetting them!\u2019 he said to himself reproach-\nfully. \u2018And yet they are more important than all the rest of us. And\nI came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away,\nif they are still alive.\u2019 He shivered.\n\u2018Harrowdale at last!\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018Our journey is almost at an\nend.\u2019 They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply.\nOnly a glimpse, as through a tall window, could be seen of the great\nvalley in the gloaming below. A single small light could be seen\ntwinkling by the river.\n\u2018This journey is over, maybe,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden, \u2018but I have far yet\nto go. Two nights ago the moon was full, and in the morning I shall\nride to Edoras to the gathering of the Mark.\u2019\n\u2018But if you would take my counsel,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer in a low voice,\n\u2018you would then return hither, until the war is over, lost or won.\u2019\nThe\u00b4oden smiled. \u2018Nay, my son, for so I will call you, speak not\nthe soft words of Wormtongue in my old ears!\u2019 He drew himself up\nand looked back at the long line of his men fading into the dusk\nbehind. \u2018Long years in the space of days it seems since I rode west;\nbut never will I lean on a staff again. If the war is lost, what good\nwill be my hiding in the hills? And if it is won, what grief will it be,\neven if I fall, spending my last strength? But we will leave this now.\nTonight I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One evening of peace"}
{"817": "In the deepening dusk they came down into the valley. Here the\nSnowbourn flowed near to the western walls of the dale, and soon\nthe path led them to a ford where the shallow waters murmured\nloudly on the stones. The ford was guarded. As the king approached\nmany men sprang up out of the shadow of the rocks; and when they\nsaw the king they cried with glad voices: \u2018The\u00b4oden King! The\u00b4oden\nKing! The King of the Mark returns!\u2019\nThen one blew a long call on a horn. It echoed in the valley. Other\nhorns answered it, and lights shone out across the river.\nAnd suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high\nabove, sounding from some hollow place, as it seemed, that gathered\ntheir notes into one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls\nof stone.\nSo the King of the Mark came back victorious out of the West to\nDunharrow beneath the feet of the White Mountains. There he found\nthe remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon\nas his coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford,\nbearing messages from Gandalf. Du\u00b4nhere, chieftain of the folk of\nHarrowdale, was at their head.\n\u2018At dawn three days ago, lord,\u2019 he said, \u2018Shadowfax came like a\nwind out of the West to Edoras, and Gandalf brought tidings of your\nvictory to gladden our hearts. But he brought also word from you\nto hasten the gathering of the Riders. And then came the winged\nShadow.\u2019\n\u2018The winged Shadow?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018We saw it also, but that\nwas in the dead of night before Gandalf left us.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe, lord,\u2019 said Du\u00b4nhere. \u2018Yet the same, or another like to it,\na flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over Edoras\nthat morning, and all men were shaken with fear. For it stooped upon\nMeduseld, and as it came low, almost to the gable, there came a cry\nthat stopped our hearts. Then it was that Gandalf counselled us not\nto assemble in the fields, but to meet you here in the valley under\nthe mountains. And he bade us to kindle no more lights or fires than\nbarest need asked. So it has been done. Gandalf spoke with great\nauthority. We trust that it is as you would wish. Naught has been\nseen in Harrowdale of these evil things.\u2019\n\u2018It is well,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018I will ride now to the Hold, and there\nbefore I go to rest I will meet the marshals and captains. Let them\ncome to me as soon as may be!\u2019\nThe road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at\nthat point little more than half a mile in width. Flats and meads of"}
{"818": "of the great roots of the Starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past.\nOn all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. Some\nthronged to the roadside, hailing the king and the riders from the West\nwith glad cries; but stretching away into the distance behind there were\nordered rows of tents and booths, and lines of picketed horses, and\ngreat store of arms, and piled spears bristling like thickets of new-\nplanted trees. Now all the great assembly was falling into shadow, and\nyet, though the night-chill blew cold from the heights, no lanterns\nglowed, no fires were lit. Watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro.\nMerry wondered how many Riders there were. He could not guess\ntheir number in the gathering gloom, but it looked to him like a great\narmy, many thousands strong. While he was peering from side to\nside the king\u2019s party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern\nside of the valley; and there suddenly the path began to climb, and\nMerry looked up in amazement. He was on a road the like of which\nhe had never seen before, a great work of men\u2019s hands in years beyond\nthe reach of song. Upwards it wound, coiling like a snake, boring its\nway across the sheer slope of rock. Steep as a stair, it looped back-\nwards and forwards as it climbed. Up it horses could walk, and wains\ncould be slowly hauled; but no enemy could come that way, except\nout of the air, if it was defended from above. At each turn of the\nroad there were great standing stones that had been carved in the\nlikeness of men, huge and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged with\ntheir stumpy arms folded on fat bellies. Some in the wearing of the\nyears had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes that still\nstared sadly at the passers-by. The Riders hardly glanced at them.\nThe Pu\u00b4kel-men they called them, and heeded them little: no power\nor terror was left in them; but Merry gazed at them with wonder and\na feeling almost of pity, as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk.\nAfter a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed\nsome hundreds of feet above the valley, but still far below he could\ndimly see a winding line of Riders crossing the ford and filing along\nthe road towards the camp prepared for them. Only the king and his\nguard were going up into the Hold.\nAt last the king\u2019s company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing\nroad passed into a cutting between walls of rock, and so went up a\nshort slope and out on to a wide upland. The Firienfeld men called it,\na green mountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep-delved\ncourses of the Snowbourn, laid upon the lap of the great mountains\nbehind: the Starkhorn southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed\nmass of I\u00b4 rensaga, between which there faced the riders, the grim\nblack wall of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain rising out of"}

Those who dared to follow\nthat road came soon to the black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and\nthe menace of the pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the\nforbidden door.\nSuch was the dark Dunharrow, the work of long-forgotten men.\nTheir name was lost and no song or legend remembered it. For what\npurpose they had made this place, as a town or secret temple or a\ntomb of kings, none in Rohan could say. Here they laboured in the\nDark Years, before ever a ship came to the western shores, or Gondor\nof the Du\u00b4nedain was built; and now they had vanished, and only the\nold Pu\u00b4kel-men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road.\nMerry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and\nblack; some were leaning, some were fallen, some cracked or broken;\nthey looked like rows of old and hungry teeth. He wondered what\nthey could be, and he hoped that the king was not going to follow\nthem into the darkness beyond. Then he saw that there were clusters\nof tents and booths on either side of the stony way; but these were\nnot set near the trees, and seemed rather to huddle away from them\ntowards the brink of the cliff. The greater number were on the right,\nwhere the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was a smaller\ncamp, in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion. From this side a\nrider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road.\nAs they drew near Merry saw that the rider was a woman with\nlong braided hair gleaming in the twilight, yet she wore a helm and\nwas clad to the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword.\n\u2018Hail, Lord of the Mark!\u2019 she cried. \u2018My heart is glad at your\nreturning.\u2019\n\u2018And you, E\u00b4 owyn,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden, \u2018is all well with you?\u2019\n\u2018All is well,\u2019 she answered; yet it seemed to Merry that her voice\nbelied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping,\nif that could be believed of one so stern of face. \u2018All is well. It was\na weary road for the people to take, torn suddenly from their homes.\nThere were hard words, for it is long since war has driven us from\nthe green fields; but there have been no evil deeds. All is now ordered,\nas you see. And your lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full\ntidings of you and knew the hour of your coming.\u2019\n\u2018So Aragorn has come then,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018Is he still here?\u2019\n\u2018No, he is gone,\u2019 said E\u00b4 owyn turning away and looking at the\nmountains dark against the East and South.\n\u2018Whither did he go?\u2019 asked E\u00b4 omer.\n\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered. \u2018He came at night, and rode away\nyestermorn, ere the Sun had climbed over the mountain-tops.

{"820": "Tell me, did he speak of that road?\u2019 He pointed away along the\ndarkening lines of stones towards the Dwimorberg. \u2018Of the Paths of\nthe Dead?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, lord,\u2019 said E\u00b4owyn. \u2018And he has passed into the shadow from\nwhich none have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is gone.\u2019\n\u2018Then our paths are sundered,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018He is lost. We must\nride without him, and our hope dwindles.\u2019\nSlowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass,\nspeaking no more, until they came to the king\u2019s pavilion. There Merry\nfound that everything was made ready, and that he himself was not\nforgotten. A little tent had been pitched for him beside the king\u2019s\nlodging; and there he sat alone, while men passed to and fro, going\nin to the king and taking counsel with him. Night came on and the\nhalf-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars,\nbut the East was dark and blank. The marching stones faded slowly\nfrom sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded\nthe vast crouching shadow of the Dwimorberg.\n\u2018The Paths of the Dead,\u2019 he muttered to himself. \u2018The Paths of\nthe Dead? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They\nhave all gone to some doom: Gandalf and Pippin to war in the East;\nand Sam and Frodo to Mordor; and Strider and Legolas and Gimli\nto the Paths of the Dead. But my turn will come soon enough, I\nsuppose. I wonder what they are all talking about, and what the king\nmeans to do. For I must go where he goes now.\u2019\nIn the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered\nthat he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else\nin this strange camp felt the same. But at that very moment a trumpet\nsounded, and a man came summoning him, the king\u2019s esquire, to\nwait at the king\u2019s board.\nIn the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off\nwith broidered hangings, and strewn with skins; and there at a small\ntable sat The\u00b4oden with E\u00b4omer and E\u00b4owyn, and Du\u00b4nhere, lord of\nHarrowdale. Merry stood beside the king\u2019s stool and waited on him,\ntill presently the old man, coming out of deep thought, turned to\nhim and smiled.\n\u2018Come, Master Meriadoc!\u2019 he said. \u2018You shall not stand. You shall\nsit beside me, as long as I remain in my own lands, and lighten my\nheart with tales.\u2019\nRoom was made for the hobbit at the king\u2019s left hand, but no one\ncalled for any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and"}
{"821": "\u2018Twice now, lord, I have heard of the Paths of the Dead,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018What are they? And where has Strider, I mean the Lord Aragorn,\nwhere has he gone?\u2019\nThe king sighed, but no one answered, until at last E\u00b4omer spoke.\n\u2018We do not know, and our hearts are heavy,\u2019 he said. \u2018But as for the\nPaths of the Dead, you have yourself walked on their first steps. Nay,\nI speak no words of ill omen! The road that we have climbed is the\napproach to the Door, yonder in the Dimholt. But what lies beyond\nno man knows.\u2019\n\u2018No man knows,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden: \u2018yet ancient legend, now seldom\nspoken, has somewhat to report. If these old tales speak true that\nhave come down from father to son in the House of Eorl, then the\nDoor under Dwimorberg leads to a secret way that goes beneath the\nmountain to some forgotten end. But none have ever ventured in to\nsearch its secrets, since Baldor, son of Brego, passed the Door and\nwas never seen among men again. A rash vow he spoke, as he drained\nthe horn at that feast which Brego made to hallow new-built Medu-\nseld, and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir.\n\u2018Folk say that Dead Men out of the Dark Years guard the way\nand will suffer no living man to come to their hidden halls; but at\nwhiles they may themselves be seen passing out of the door like\nshadows and down the stony road. Then the people of Harrowdale\nshut fast their doors and shroud their windows and are afraid. But\nthe Dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and\ncoming death.\u2019\n\u2018Yet it is said in Harrowdale,\u2019 said E\u00b4owyn in a low voice, \u2018that in\nthe moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array\npassed by. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony\nroad and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.\u2019\n\u2018Then why has Aragorn gone that way?\u2019 asked Merry. \u2018Don\u2019t you\nknow anything that would explain it?\u2019\n\u2018Unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not\nheard,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer, \u2018none now in the land of the living can tell his\npurpose.\u2019\n\u2018Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him first in the\nking\u2019s house,\u2019 said E\u00b4owyn: \u2018grimmer, older. Fey I thought him, and\nlike one whom the Dead call.\u2019\n\u2018Maybe he was called,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden; \u2018and my heart tells me that\nI shall not see him again. Yet he is a kingly man of high destiny. And\ntake comfort in this, daughter, since comfort you seem to need in\nyour grief for this guest.

And then a voice came out of him,\nas it were out of the ground, and to their amaze it spoke in the\nwestern tongue: The way is shut.\n\u2018Then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still;\nbut he did not look at them. The way is shut, his voice said again. It\nwas made by those who are Dead, and the Dead keep it, until the time\ncomes. The way is shut.\n\u2018And when will that time be? said Baldor. But no answer did he ever\nget. For the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face; and\nno other tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our\nfolk ever learned. Yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and\nAragorn may pass.\u2019\n\u2018But how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no,\nsave by daring the Door?\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018And that way I would not go\nthough all the hosts of Mordor stood before me, and I were alone\nand had no other refuge.

Gandalf the Grey has been among us, and\neven now we are mustering for battle in the East.\u2019\n\u2018What the Lord Denethor may know or guess of all these things\nI cannot say,\u2019 answered Hirgon. \u2018But indeed our case is desperate.\nMy lord does not issue any command to you, he begs you only to\nremember old friendship and oaths long spoken, and for your own\ngood to do all that you may. It is reported to us that many kings\nhave ridden in from the East to the service of Mordor. From the\nNorth to the field of Dagorlad there is skirmish and rumour of war.\nIn the South the Haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on all our\ncoastlands, so that little help will come to us thence. Make haste!\nFor it is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time\nwill be decided, and if the tide be not stemmed there, then it will\nflow over all the fair fields of Rohan, and even in this Hold among\nthe hills there shall be no refuge.\u2019\n\u2018Dark tidings,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden, \u2018yet not all unguessed. But say to\nDenethor that even if Rohan itself felt no peril, still we would come\nto his aid. But we have suffered much loss in our battles with Saruman\nthe traitor, and we must still think of our frontier to the north and\neast, as his own tidings make clear. So great a power as the Dark\nLord seems now to wield might well contain us in battle before the\nCity and yet strike with great force across the River away beyond the\nGate of Kings.\n\u2018But we will speak no longer counsels of prudence. We will come.\nThe weapontake was set for the morrow. When all is ordered we will\nset out. Ten thousand spears I might have sent riding over the plain\nto the dismay of your foes. It will be less now, I fear; for I will not\nleave my strongholds all unguarded. Yet six thousands at the least\nshall ride behind me. For say to Denethor that in this hour the King"}
{"824": "must reach the end with strength to fight. A week it may be from\ntomorrow\u2019s morn ere you hear the cry of the Sons of Eorl coming\nfrom the North.\u2019\n\u2018A week!\u2019 said Hirgon. \u2018If it must be so, it must. But you are like\nto find only ruined walls in seven days from now, unless other help\nunlooked-for comes. Still, you may at the least disturb the Orcs and\nSwarthy Men from their feasting in the White Tower.\u2019\n\u2018At the least we will do that,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018But I myself am\nnew-come from battle and long journey, and I will now go to rest.\nTarry here this night. Then you shall look on the muster of Rohan\nand ride away the gladder for the sight, and the swifter for the rest.\nIn the morning counsels are best, and night changes many thoughts.\u2019\nWith that the king stood up, and they all rose. \u2018Go now each to your\nrest,\u2019 he said, \u2018and sleep well. And you, Master Meriadoc, I need no\nmore tonight. But be ready to my call as soon as the Sun is risen.\u2019\n\u2018I will be ready,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018even if you bid me ride with you on\nthe Paths of the Dead.\u2019\n\u2018Speak not words of omen!\u2019 said the king. \u2018For there may be more\nroads than one that could bear that name. But I did not say that I\nwould bid you ride with me on any road. Good night!\u2019\n\u2018I won\u2019t be left behind, to be called for on return!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I\nwon\u2019t be left, I won\u2019t.\u2019 And repeating this over and over again to\nhimself he fell asleep at last in his tent.\nHe was wakened by a man shaking him. \u2018Wake up, wake up,\nMaster Holbytla!\u2019 he cried; and at length Merry came out of deep\ndreams and sat up with a start. It still seemed very dark, he thought.\n\u2018What is the matter?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018The king calls for you.\u2019\n\u2018But the Sun has not risen, yet,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018No, and will not rise today, Master Holbytla. Nor ever again, one\nwould think under this cloud. But time does not stand still, though\nthe Sun be lost. Make haste!\u2019\nFlinging on some clothes, Merry looked outside. The world was\ndarkling. The very air seemed brown, and all things about were black\nand grey and shadowless; there was a great stillness. No shape of\ncloud could be seen, unless it were far away westward, where the\nfurthest groping fingers of the great gloom still crawled onwards and\na little light leaked through them. Overhead there hung a heavy roof,\nsombre and featureless, and light seemed rather to be failing than\ngrowing."}
{"825": "he made his way to the king. Hirgon the rider of Gondor was there\nbefore him, and beside him stood now another man, like him and\ndressed alike, but shorter and broader. As Merry entered he was\nspeaking to the king.\n\u2018It comes from Mordor, lord,\u2019 he said. \u2018It began last night at sunset.\nFrom the hills in the Eastfold of your realm I saw it rise and creep\nacross the sky, and all night as I rode it came behind eating up the\nstars. Now the great cloud hangs over all the land between here and\nthe Mountains of Shadow; and it is deepening. War has already\nbegun.\u2019\nFor a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. \u2018So we come to\nit in the end,\u2019 he said: \u2018the great battle of our time, in which many\nthings shall pass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding.\nWe will ride the straight way and the open road and with all our\nspeed. The muster shall begin at once, and wait for none that tarry.\nHave you good store in Minas Tirith? For if we must ride now in all\nhaste, then we must ride light, with but meal and water enough to\nlast us into battle.\u2019\n\u2018We have very great store long prepared,\u2019 answered Hirgon. \u2018Ride\nnow as light and as swift as you may!\u2019\n\u2018Then call the heralds, E\u00b4 omer,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Let the Riders be\nmarshalled!\u2019\nE\u00b4omer went out, and presently the trumpets rang in the Hold and\nwere answered by many others from below; but their voices no longer\nsounded clear and brave as they had seemed to Merry the night\nbefore. Dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air, braying\nominously.\nThe king turned to Merry. \u2018I am going to war, Master Meriadoc,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018In a little while I shall take the road. I release you from my\nservice, but not from my friendship. You shall abide here, and if you\nwill, you shall serve the Lady E\u00b4owyn, who will govern the folk in my\nstead.\u2019\n\u2018But, but, lord,\u2019 Merry stammered, \u2018I offered you my sword. I do\nnot want to be parted from you like this, The\u00b4oden King. And as all\nmy friends have gone to the battle, I should be ashamed to stay\nbehind.\u2019\n\u2018But we ride on horses tall and swift,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden; \u2018and great\nthough your heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.\u2019\n\u2018Then tie me on to the back of one, or let me hang on a stirrup,\nor something,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018It is a long way to run; but run I shall,"}
{"826": "Snowmane,\u2019 he said. \u2018But at the least you shall ride with me to Edoras\nand look on Meduseld; for that way I shall go. So far Stybba can\nbear you: the great race will not begin till we reach the plains.\u2019\nThen E\u00b4owyn rose up. \u2018Come now, Meriadoc!\u2019 she said. \u2018I will\nshow you the gear that I have prepared for you.\u2019 They went out\ntogether. \u2018This request only did Aragorn make to me,\u2019 said E\u00b4 owyn,\nas they passed among the tents, \u2018that you should be armed for battle.\nI have granted it, as I could. For my heart tells me that you will need\nsuch gear ere the end.\u2019\nNow she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king\u2019s\nguard; and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and\na round shield, and other gear.\n\u2018No mail have we to fit you,\u2019 said E\u00b4 owyn, \u2018nor any time for the\nforging of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather,\na belt, and a knife. A sword you have.\u2019\nMerry bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like\nthe shield that had been given to Gimli, and it bore on it the device\nof the white horse. \u2018Take all these things,\u2019 she said, \u2018and bear them\nto good fortune! Farewell now, Master Meriadoc! Yet maybe we shall\nmeet again, you and I.\u2019\nSo it was that amid a gathering gloom the King of the Mark made\nready to lead all his Riders on the eastward road. Hearts were heavy\nand many quailed in the shadow. But they were a stern people, loyal\nto their lord, and little weeping or murmuring was heard, even in the\ncamp in the Hold where the exiles from Edoras were housed, women\nand children and old men. Doom hung over them, but they faced it\nsilently.\nTwo swift hours passed, and now the king sat upon his white\nhorse, glimmering in the half-light. Proud and tall he seemed, though\nthe hair that flowed beneath his high helm was like snow; and many\nmarvelled at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid.\nThere on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in\nmany companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of Riders fully\narmed, and many hundreds of other men with spare horses lightly\nburdened. A single trumpet sounded. The king raised his hand, and\nthen silently the host of the Mark began to move. Foremost went\ntwelve of the king\u2019s household-men, Riders of renown. Then the king\nfollowed with E\u00b4omer on his right. He had said farewell to E\u00b4owyn\nabove in the Hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned\nhis mind to the road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry rode on\nStybba with the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again"}
{"827": "had come almost to the end of the line one looked up glancing keenly\nat the hobbit. A young man, Merry thought as he returned the glance,\nless in height and girth than most. He caught the glint of clear grey\neyes; and then he shivered, for it came suddenly to him that it was\nthe face of one without hope who goes in search of death.\nOn down the grey road they went beside the Snowbourn rushing\non its stones; through the hamlets of Underharrow and Upbourn,\nwhere many sad faces of women looked out from dark doors; and so\nwithout horn or harp or music of men\u2019s voices the great ride into the\nEast began with which the songs of Rohan were busy for many long\nlives of men thereafter.\nFrom dark Dunharrow in the dim morning\nwith thane and captain rode Thengel\u2019s son:\nto Edoras he came, the ancient halls\nof the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded;\ngolden timbers were in gloom mantled.\nFarewell he bade to his free people,\nhearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places,\nwhere long he had feasted ere the light faded.\nForth rode the king, fear behind him,\nfate before him. Fealty kept he;\noaths he had taken, all fulfilled them.\nForth rode The\u00b4oden. Five nights and days\neast and onward rode the Eorlingas\nthrough Folde and Fenmarch and the Firienwood,\nsix thousand spears to Sunlending,\nMundburg the mighty under Mindolluin,\nSea-kings\u2019 city in the South-kingdom\nfoe-beleaguered, fire-encircled.\nDoom drove them on. Darkness took them,\nhorse and horseman; hoofbeats afar\nsank into silence: so the songs tell us.\nIt was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras,\nalthough it was then but noon by the hour. There he halted only a\nshort while and strengthened his host by some three score of Riders\nthat came late to the weapontake. Now having eaten he made ready\nto set out again, and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell. But\nMerry begged for the last time not to be parted from him.\n\u2018This is no journey for such steeds as Stybba, as I have told you,\u2019\nsaidThe\u00b4oden.\u2018Andinsuchabattleaswethinktomakeonthefields"}
{"828": "\u2018As for that, who can tell?\u2019 answered Merry. \u2018But why, lord, did\nyou receive me as swordthain, if not to stay by your side? And I\nwould not have it said of me in song only that I was always left\nbehind!\u2019\n\u2018I received you for your safe-keeping,\u2019 answered The\u00b4oden; \u2018and\nalso to do as I might bid. None of my Riders can bear you as burden.\nIf the battle were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be\nremembered by the minstrels; but it is a hundred leagues and two\nto Mundburg where Denethor is lord. I will say no more.\u2019\nMerry bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of\nhorsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were\ntightening girths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some\ngazed uneasily at the lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and\nspoke softly in the hobbit\u2019s ear.\n\u2018Where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,\u2019 he whispered; \u2018and\nso I have found myself.\u2019 Merry looked up and saw that it was the\nyoung Rider whom he had noticed in the morning. \u2018You wish to go\nwhither the Lord of the Mark goes: I see it in your face.\u2019\n\u2018I do,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018Then you shall go with me,\u2019 said the Rider. \u2018I will bear you before\nme, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet\ndarker. Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any\nman, but come!\u2019\n\u2018Thank you indeed!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Thank you, sir, though I do not\nknow your name.\u2019\n\u2018Do you not?\u2019 said the Rider softly. \u2018Then call me Dernhelm.\u2019\nThus it came to pass that when the king set out, before Dernhelm\nsat Meriadoc the hobbit, and the great grey steed Windfola made\nlittle of the burden; for Dernhelm was less in weight than many men,\nthough lithe and well-knit in frame.\nOn into the shadow they rode. In the willow-thickets where Snow-\nbourn flowed into Entwash, twelve leagues east of Edoras, they\ncamped that night. And then on again through the Folde; and through\nthe Fenmarch, where to their right great oakwoods climbed on the\nskirts of the hills under the shades of dark Halifirien by the borders\nof Gondor; but away to their left the mists lay on the marshes fed\nby the mouths of Entwash. And as they rode rumour came of war\nin the North. Lone men, riding wild, brought word of foes assailing\ntheir east-borders, of orc-hosts marching in the Wold of Rohan.\n\u2018Ride on!

{"830": "Chapter 4\nTHE SIEGE OF GONDOR\nPippin was roused by Gandalf. Candles were lit in their chamber,\nfor only a dim twilight came through the windows; the air was heavy\nas with approaching thunder.\n\u2018What is the time?\u2019 said Pippin yawning.\n\u2018Past the second hour,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Time to get up and make\nyourself presentable. You are summoned to the Lord of the City to\nlearn your new duties.\u2019\n\u2018And will he provide breakfast?\u2019\n\u2018No! I have provided it: all that you will get till noon. Food is now\ndoled out by order.\u2019\nPippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and (he thought) very\ninadequate pat of butter which was set out for him, beside a cup of\nthin milk. \u2018Why did you bring me here?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018You know quite well,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018To keep you out of mischief;\nand if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought\nit on yourself.\u2019 Pippin said no more.\nBefore long he was walking with Gandalf once more down the\ncold corridor to the door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in\na grey gloom, like an old patient spider, Pippin thought; he did not\nseem to have moved since the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to\na seat, but Pippin was left for a while standing unheeded. Presently\nthe old man turned to him:\n\u2018Well, Master Peregrin, I hope that you used yesterday to your\nprofit, and to your liking? Though I fear that the board is barer in\nthis city than you could wish.\u2019\nPippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had\nsaid or done was somehow known to the Lord of the City, and much\nwas guessed of what he thought as well. He did not answer.\n\u2018What would you do in my service?\u2019\n\u2018I thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.\u2019\n\u2018I will, when I learn what you are fit for,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018But that\nI shall learn soonest, maybe, if I keep you beside me. The esquire of\nmy chamber has begged leave to go to the out-garrison, so you shall\ntake his place for a while. You shall wait on me, bear errands, and\ntalk to me, if war and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?\u2019"}
{"831": "sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain. And most of my\nsongs are about things that make us laugh; or about food and drink,\nof course.\u2019\n\u2018And why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such\nhours as these? We who have lived long under the Shadow may surely\nlisten to echoes from a land untroubled by it? Then we may feel that\nour vigil was not fruitless, though it may have been thankless.\u2019\nPippin\u2019s heart sank. He did not relish the idea of singing any song\nof the Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic ones\nthat he knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion.\nHe was however spared the ordeal for the present. He was not com-\nmanded to sing. Denethor turned to Gandalf, asking questions about\nthe Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of E\u00b4 omer, the king\u2019s\nnephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount that the Lord seemed to\nknow about a people that lived far away, though it must, he thought,\nbe many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad.\nPresently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for\na while. \u2018Go to the armouries of the Citadel,\u2019 he said, \u2018and get you\nthere the livery and gear of the Tower. It will be ready. It was com-\nmanded yesterday. Return when you are clad!\u2019\nIt was as he said; and Pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange\ngarments, all of black and silver. He had a small hauberk, its rings\nforged of steel, maybe, yet black as jet; and a high-crowned helm\nwith small raven-wings on either side, set with a silver star in the\ncentre of the circlet. Above the mail was a short surcoat of black, but\nbroidered on the breast in silver with the token of the Tree. His old\nclothes were folded and put away, but he was permitted to keep the\ngrey cloak of Lo\u00b4rien, though not to wear it when on duty. He looked\nnow, had he known it, verily Ernil i Pheriannath, the Prince of the\nHalflings, that folk had called him; but he felt uncomfortable. And\nthe gloom began to weigh on his spirits.\nIt was dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening\nthe heavy shadow had deepened, and all hearts in the City were\noppressed. Far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from\nthe Black Land, devouring light, borne upon a wind of war; but\nbelow the air was still and breathless, as if all the Vale of Anduin\nwaited for the onset of a ruinous storm.\nAbout the eleventh hour, released at last for a while from service,\nPippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his\nheavy heart and make his task of waiting more supportable. In the\nmesses he met Beregond again, who had just come from an errand"}
{"832": "indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. Now they sat side by\nside again in the embrasure looking eastward, where they had eaten\nand talked the day before.\nIt was the sunset-hour, but the great pall had now stretched far\ninto the West, and only as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun\nescape to send out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as\nFrodo saw it at the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king.\nBut to the fields of the Pelennor, under the shadow of Mindolluin,\nthere came no gleam: they were brown and drear.\nAlready it seemed years to Pippin since he had sat there before,\nin some half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit, a light-\nhearted wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through.\nNow he was one small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault,\nclad in the proud but sombre manner of the Tower of Guard.\nIn some other time and place Pippin might have been pleased with\nhis new array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he\nwas in deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril.\nThe hauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head.\nHis cloak he had cast aside upon the seat. He turned his tired gaze away\nfrom the darkling fields below and yawned, and then he sighed.\n\u2018You are weary of this day?\u2019 said Beregond.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have\nkicked my heels at the door of my master\u2019s chamber for many slow\nhours, while he has debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other\ngreat persons. And I\u2019m not used, Master Beregond, to waiting hungry\non others while they eat. It is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. No doubt\nyou will think I should feel the honour more deeply. But what is the\ngood of such honour? Indeed what is the good even of food and drink\nunder this creeping shadow? What does it mean? The very air seems\nthick and brown! Do you often have such glooms when the wind is\nin the East?\u2019\n\u2018Nay,\u2019 said Beregond, \u2018this is no weather of the world. This is\nsome device of his malice; some broil of fume from the Mountain of\nFire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth\nindeed. I wish the Lord Faramir would return. He would not be\ndismayed. But now, who knows if he will ever come back across the\nRiver out of the Darkness?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018Gandalf, too, is anxious. He was disappointed,\nI think, not to find Faramir here. And where has he got to himself ?\nHe left the Lord\u2019s council before the noon-meal, and in no good\nmood either, I thought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.\u2019"}
{"833": "his ears; but Beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement\nas he spoke of Faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with\nstarting eyes. Pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it\nwas the same that he had heard long ago in the Marish of the Shire,\nbut now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with\na poisonous despair.\nAt last Beregond spoke with an effort. \u2018They have come!\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Take courage and look! There are fell things below.\u2019\nReluctantly Pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the\nwall. The Pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce\nguessed line of the Great River. But now wheeling swiftly across it,\nlike shadows of untimely night, he saw in the middle airs below him\nfive birdlike forms, horrible as carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles,\ncruel as death. Now they swooped near, venturing almost within\nbowshot of the walls, now they circled away.\n\u2018Black Riders!\u2019 muttered Pippin. \u2018Black Riders of the air! But see,\nBeregond!\u2019 he cried. \u2018They are looking for something, surely? See\nhow they wheel and swoop, always down to that point over there!\nAnd can you see something moving on the ground? Dark little things.\nYes, men on horses: four or five. Ah! I cannot stand it! Gandalf !\nGandalf save us!\u2019\nAnother long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back\nagain from the wall, panting like a hunted animal. Faint and seem-\ningly remote through that shuddering cry he heard winding up from\nbelow the sound of a trumpet ending on a long high note.\n\u2018Faramir! The Lord Faramir! It is his call!\u2019 cried Beregond. \u2018Brave\nheart! But how can he win to the Gate, if these foul hell-hawks have\nother weapons than fear? But look! They hold on. They will make\nthe Gate. No! the horses are running mad. Look! the men are thrown;\nthey are running on foot. No, one is still up, but he rides back to the\nothers. That will be the Captain: he can master both beasts and men.\nAh! there one of the foul things is stooping on him. Help! help! Will\nno one go out to him? Faramir!\u2019\nWith that Beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom.\nAshamed of his terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of\nthe captain whom he loved, Pippin got up and peered out. At that\nmoment he caught a flash of white and silver coming from the North,\nlike a small star down on the dusky fields. It moved with the speed\nof an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight\nof the four men towards the Gate. It seemed to Pippin that a pale\nlight was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it;\nand then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo in"}

Gandalf, Gandalf !\u2019 he\nshouted wildly, like an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner\nwho is far beyond encouragement.\nBut now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer.\nOne wheeled towards him; but it seemed to Pippin that he raised his\nhand, and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards. The Nazgu\u02c6l\ngave a long wailing cry and swerved away; and with that the four\nothers wavered, and then rising in swift spirals they passed away\neastward vanishing into the lowering cloud above; and down on the\nPelennor it seemed for a while less dark.\nPippin watched, and he saw the horseman and the White Rider\nmeet and halt, waiting for those on foot. Men now hurried out to\nthem from the City; and soon they all passed from sight under the\nouter walls, and he knew that they were entering the Gate. Guessing\nthat they would come at once to the Tower and the Steward, he\nhurried to the entrance of the citadel. There he was joined by many\nothers who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls.\nIt was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading\nup from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying\nof the names of Faramir and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw\ntorches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding\nslowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight\nas if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was\nbowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took Shadowfax and the\nother horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: Gandalf\nsteadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his\neyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary\nor a wounded man.\nPippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the\ngate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his\nbreath. It was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear\nor anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave\nhe stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing\nat him saw how closely he resembled his brother Boromir \u2013 whom\nPippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man\u2019s lordly but\nkindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was strangely\nmoved with a feeling that he had not known before. Here was one\nwith an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less\nhigh perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings\nof Men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and\nsadness of the Elder Race. He knew now why Beregond spoke his\nname with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he"}

Whence...?\u2019\nBut with that Gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. \u2018He came\nwith me from the land of the Halflings,\u2019 he said. \u2018He came with me.\nBut let us not tarry here. There is much to say and to do, and you\nare weary. He shall come with us. Indeed he must, for if he does not\nforget his new duties more easily than I do, he must attend on his\nlord again within this hour. Come, Pippin, follow us!\u2019\nSo at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the\nCity. There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine\nwas brought; and there Pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair\nof Denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to\nall that was said.\nWhen Faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of\nwine, he sat upon a low chair at his father\u2019s left hand. Removed a\nlittle upon the other side sat Gandalf in a chair of carven wood; and\nhe seemed at first to be asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke\nonly of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before,\nand he brought tidings of Ithilien and of movements of the Enemy\nand his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of\nHarad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to\nhis master such matters as had often been heard before, small things\nof border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their\nrenown.\nThen suddenly Faramir looked at Pippin. \u2018But now we come to\nstrange matters,\u2019 he said. \u2018For this is not the first halfling that I have\nseen walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.\u2019\nAt that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he\nsaid nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin\u2019s\nlips. Denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in\nsign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while\nthe others sat silent and still, Faramir told his tale, with his eyes for\nthe most part on Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to\nPippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.\nAs his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant\nand of the events at Henneth Annu\u02c6n, Pippin became aware that\nGandalf \u2019s hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood.\nWhite they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them,\nsuddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin knew that Gandalf, Gandalf"}
{"836": "and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol, his voice fell, and he shook\nhis head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up.\n\u2018Cirith Ungol? Morgul Vale?\u2019 he said. \u2018The time, Faramir, the\ntime? When did you part with them? When would they reach that\naccursed valley?\u2019\n\u2018I parted with them in the morning two days ago,\u2019 said Faramir.\n\u2018It is fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the Morgulduin, if they\nwent straight south; and then they would be still five leagues westward\nof the accursed Tower. At swiftest they could not come there before\ntoday, and maybe they have not come there yet. Indeed I see what\nyou fear. But the darkness is not due to their venture. It began\nyestereve, and all Ithilien was under shadow last night. It is clear to\nme that the Enemy has long planned an assault on us, and its hour had\nalready been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping.\u2019\nGandalf paced the floor. \u2018The morning of two days ago, nigh on\nthree days of journey! How far is the place where you parted?\u2019\n\u2018Some twenty-five leagues as a bird flies,\u2019 answered Faramir. \u2018But\nI could not come more swiftly. Yestereve I lay at Cair Andros, the\nlong isle in the River northward which we hold in defence; and horses\nare kept on the hither bank. As the dark drew on I knew that haste\nwas needed, so I rode thence with three others that could also be\nhorsed. The rest of my company I sent south to strengthen the garri-\nson at the fords of Osgiliath. I hope that I have not done ill?\u2019 He\nlooked at his father.\n\u2018Ill?\u2019 cried Denethor, and his eyes flashed suddenly. \u2018Why do you\nask? The men were under your command. Or do you ask for my\njudgement on all your deeds? Your bearing is lowly in my presence,\nyet it is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel.\nSee, you have spoken skilfully, as ever; but I, have I not seen your\neye fixed on Mithrandir, seeking whether you said well or too much?\nHe has long had your heart in his keeping.\n\u2018My son, your father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear,\nas was my wont; and little of what you have half said or left unsaid\nis now hidden from me. I know the answer to many riddles. Alas,\nalas for Boromir!\u2019\n\u2018If what I have done displeases you, my father,\u2019 said Faramir\nquietly, \u2018I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so\nweighty a judgement was thrust on me.\u2019\n\u2018Would that have availed to change your judgement?\u2019 said\nDenethor. \u2018You would still have done just so, I deem. I know you\nwell. Ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as a king of\nold, gracious, gentle. That may well befit one of high race, if he sits"}
{"837": "\u2018So be it,\u2019 said Faramir.\n\u2018So be it!\u2019 cried Denethor. \u2018But not with your death only, Lord\nFaramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people,\nwhom it is your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.\u2019\n\u2018Do you wish then,\u2019 said Faramir, \u2018that our places had been\nexchanged?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I wish that indeed,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018For Boromir was loyal\nto me and no wizard\u2019s pupil. He would have remembered his father\u2019s\nneed, and would not have squandered what fortune gave. He would\nhave brought me a mighty gift.\u2019\nFor a moment Faramir\u2019s restraint gave way. \u2018I would ask you, my\nfather, to remember why it was that I, not he, was in Ithilien. On\none occasion at least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. It was\nthe Lord of the City that gave the errand to him.\u2019\n\u2018Stir not the bitterness in the cup that I mixed for myself,\u2019 said\nDenethor. \u2018Have I not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue,\nforeboding that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find.\nWould it were not so! Would that this thing had come to me!\u2019\n\u2018Comfort yourself !\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018In no case would Boromir have\nbrought it to you. He is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace!\nYet you deceive yourself. He would have stretched out his hand to\nthis thing, and taking it he would have fallen. He would have kept\nit for his own, and when he returned you would not have known\nyour son.\u2019\nThe face of Denethor set hard and cold. \u2018You found Boromir less\napt to your hand, did you not?\u2019 he said softly. \u2018But I who was his\nfather say that he would have brought it to me. You are wise, maybe,\nMithrandir, yet with all your subtleties you have not all wisdom.\nCounsels may be found that are neither the webs of wizards nor the\nhaste of fools. I have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you\ndeem.\u2019\n\u2018What then is your wisdom?\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid. To use this\nthing is perilous. At this hour, to send it in the hands of a witless\nhalfling into the land of the Enemy himself, as you have done, and\nthis son of mine, that is madness.\u2019\n\u2018And the Lord Denethor what would he have done?\u2019\n\u2018Neither. But most surely not for any argument would he have set\nthis thing at a hazard beyond all but a fool\u2019s hope, risking our utter\nruin, if the Enemy should recover what he lost. Nay, it should have\nbeen kept, hidden, hidden dark and deep. Not used, I say, unless at\ntheuttermostendofneed,butsetbeyondhisgrasp,savebyavictory"}

And for me, I pity even his slaves.\u2019\n\u2018And where will other men look for help, if Gondor falls?\u2019 answered\nDenethor. \u2018If I had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel,\nwe should not then shake with dread under this gloom, fearing the\nworst, and our counsels would be undisturbed. If you do not trust\nme to endure the test, you do not know me yet.\u2019\n\u2018Nonetheless I do not trust you,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Had I done so, I\ncould have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself\nand others much anguish. And now hearing you speak I trust you\nless, no more than Boromir. Nay, stay your wrath! I do not trust\nmyself in this, and I refused this thing, even as a freely given gift. You\nare strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, Denethor; yet\nif you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. Were\nit buried beneath the roots of Mindolluin, still it would burn your\nmind away, as the darkness grows, and the yet worse things follow\nthat soon shall come upon us.\u2019\nFor a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced\nGandalf, and Pippin felt once more the strain between their wills;\nbut now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from\neye to eye, flickering as they fenced. Pippin trembled fearing some\ndreadful stroke. But suddenly Denethor relaxed and grew cold again.\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\u2018If I had! If you had!\u2019 he said. \u2018Such words and ifs are vain. It has\ngone into the Shadow, and only time will show what doom awaits\nit, and us. The time will not be long. In what is left, let all who fight\nthe Enemy in their fashion be at one, and keep hope while they may,\nand after hope still the hardihood to die free.\u2019 He turned to Faramir.\n\u2018What think you of the garrison at Osgiliath?\u2019\n\u2018It is not strong,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018I have sent the company of Ithilien\nto strengthen it, as I have said.\u2019\n\u2018Not enough, I deem,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018It is there that the first\nblow will fall. They will have need of some stout captain there.\u2019\n\u2018There and elsewhere in many places,\u2019 said Faramir, and sighed.\n\u2018Alas for my brother, whom I too loved!\u2019 He rose. \u2018May I have your\nleave, father?\u2019 And then he swayed and leaned upon his father\u2019s chair.\n\u2018You are weary, I see,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018You have ridden fast and\nfar, and under shadows of evil in the air, I am told.\u2019\n\u2018Let us not speak of that!\u2019 said Faramir.\n\u2018Then we will not,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018Go now and rest as you may.\nTomorrow\u2019s need will be sterner.\u2019"}
{"839": "with Pippin beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their\nlodging. They did not speak until they were behind closed doors.\nThen at last Pippin took Gandalf \u2019s hand.\n\u2018Tell me,\u2019 he said, \u2018is there any hope? For Frodo, I mean; or at\nleast mostly for Frodo.\u2019\nGandalf put his hand on Pippin\u2019s head. \u2018There never was much\nhope,\u2019 he answered. \u2018Just a fool\u2019s hope, as I have been told. And\nwhen I heard of Cirith Ungol\u2014\u2014\u2019 He broke off and strode to the\nwindow, as if his eyes could pierce the night in the East. \u2018Cirith\nUngol!\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Why that way, I wonder?\u2019 He turned. \u2018Just\nnow, Pippin, my heart almost failed me, hearing that name. And yet in\ntruth I believe that the news that Faramir brings has some hope in it.\nFor it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his war at last and made\nthe first move while Frodo was still free. So now for many days he will\nhave his eye turned this way and that, away from his own land. And\nyet, Pippin, I feel from afar his haste and fear. He has begun sooner\nthan he would. Something has happened to stir him.\u2019\nGandalf stood for a moment in thought. \u2018Maybe,\u2019 he muttered.\n\u2018Maybe even your foolishness helped, my lad. Let me see: some five\ndays ago now he would discover that we had thrown down Saruman,\nand had taken the Stone. Still what of that? We could not use it to\nmuch purpose, or without his knowing. Ah! I wonder. Aragorn? His\ntime draws near. And he is strong and stern underneath, Pippin;\nbold, determined, able to take his own counsel and dare great risks\nat need. That may be it. He may have used the Stone and shown\nhimself to the Enemy, challenging him, for this very purpose. I\nwonder. Well, we shall not know the answer till the Riders of Rohan\ncome, if they do not come too late. There are evil days ahead. To\nsleep while we may!\u2019\n\u2018But,\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018But what?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Only one but will I allow tonight.\u2019\n\u2018Gollum,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018How on earth could they be going about\nwith him, even following him? And I could see that Faramir did not\nlike the place he was taking them to any more than you do. What is\nwrong?\u2019\n\u2018I cannot answer that now,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Yet my heart guessed\nthat Frodo and Gollum would meet before the end. For good, or for\nevil. But of Cirith Ungol I will not speak tonight. Treachery, treachery\nI fear; treachery of that miserable creature. But so it must be. Let us\nremember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does\nnot intend. It can be so, sometimes. Good night!\u2019"}
{"840": "again. The winged Shadows were not seen again that day, yet ever\nand anon, high above the city, a faint cry would come, and many\nwho heard it would stand stricken with a passing dread, while the\nless stout-hearted quailed and wept.\nAnd now Faramir was gone again. \u2018They give him no rest,\u2019 some\nmurmured. \u2018The Lord drives his son too hard, and now he must do\nthe duty of two, for himself and for the one that will not return.\u2019\nAnd ever men looked northward, asking: \u2018Where are the Riders of\nRohan?\u2019\nIn truth Faramir did not go by his own choosing. But the Lord\nof the City was master of his Council, and he was in no mood that\nday to bow to others. Early in the morning the Council had been\nsummoned. There all the captains judged that because of the threat\nin the South their force was too weak to make any stroke of war on\ntheir own part, unless perchance the Riders of Rohan yet should\ncome. Meanwhile they must man the walls and wait.\n\u2018Yet,\u2019 said Denethor, \u2018we should not lightly abandon the outer\ndefences, the Rammas made with so great a labour. And the Enemy\nmust pay dearly for the crossing of the River. That he cannot do, in\nforce to assail the City, either north of Cair Andros because of the\nmarshes, or southwards towards Lebennin because of the breadth of\nthe River, that needs many boats. It is at Osgiliath that he will put\nhis weight, as before when Boromir denied him the passage.\u2019\n\u2018That was but a trial,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018Today we may make the\nEnemy pay ten times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange.\nFor he can afford to lose a host better than we to lose a company.\nAnd the retreat of those that we put out far afield will be perilous, if\nhe wins across in force.\u2019\n\u2018And what of Cair Andros?\u2019 said the Prince. \u2018That, too, must be\nheld, if Osgiliath is defended. Let us not forget the danger on our\nleft. The Rohirrim may come, and they may not. But Faramir has\ntold us of great strength drawing ever to the Black Gate. More than\none host may issue from it, and strike for more than one passage.\u2019\n\u2018Much must be risked in war,\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018Cair Andros is\nmanned, and no more can be sent so far. But I will not yield the\nRiver and the Pelennor unfought \u2013 not if there is a captain here who\nhas still the courage to do his lord\u2019s will.\u2019\nThen all were silent. But at length Faramir said: \u2018I do not oppose\nyour will, sire. Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will go and do\nwhat I can in his stead \u2013 if you command it.\u2019\n\u2018I do so,\u2019 said Denethor.\n\u2018Then farewell!\u2019 saidFaramir. \u2018But if Ishould return, think better"}

Your father loves you,\nFaramir, and will remember it ere the end. Farewell!\u2019\nSo now the Lord Faramir had gone forth again, and had taken with\nhim such strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared. On\nthe walls some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and\nthey wondered what chanced there, for nothing could be seen. And\nothers, as ever, looked north and counted the leagues to The\u00b4oden in\nRohan. \u2018Will he come? Will he remember our old alliance?\u2019 they said.\n\u2018Yes, he will come,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018even if he comes too late. But\nthink! At best the Red Arrow cannot have reached him more than\ntwo days ago, and the miles are long from Edoras.\u2019\nIt was night again ere news came. A man rode in haste from the\nfords, saying that a host had issued from Minas Morgul and was\nalready drawing nigh to Osgiliath; and it had been joined by regiments\nfrom the South, Haradrim, cruel and tall. \u2018And we have learned,\u2019\nsaid the messenger, \u2018that the Black Captain leads them once again,\nand the fear of him has passed before him over the River.\u2019\nWith those ill-boding words the third day closed since Pippin came\nto Minas Tirith. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that\neven Faramir could hold the fords for long.\nThe next day, though the darkness had reached its full and grew\nno deeper, it weighed heavier on men\u2019s hearts, and a great dread was\non them. Ill news came soon again. The passage of Anduin was won\nby the Enemy. Faramir was retreating to the wall of the Pelennor,\nrallying his men to the Causeway Forts; but he was ten times out-\nnumbered.\n\u2018If he wins back at all across the Pelennor, his enemies will be on\nhis heels,\u2019 said the messenger. \u2018They have paid dear for the crossing,\nbut less dearly than we hoped. The plan has been well laid. It is now\nseen that in secret they have long been building floats and barges in\ngreat number in East Osgiliath. They swarmed across like beetles.\nBut it is the Black Captain that defeats us. Few will stand and abide\neven the rumour of his coming. His own folk quail at him, and they\nwould slay themselves at his bidding.\u2019\n\u2018Then I am needed there more than here,\u2019 said Gandalf, and rode\noff at once, and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight. And all\nthat night Pippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed"}
{"842": "The bells of day had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the\nunlightened dark, when far away he saw fires spring up, across in the\ndim spaces where the walls of the Pelennor stood. The watchmen\ncried aloud, and all men in the City stood to arms. Now ever and\nanon there was a red flash, and slowly through the heavy air dull\nrumbles could be heard.\n\u2018They have taken the wall!\u2019 men cried. \u2018They are blasting breaches\nin it. They are coming!\u2019\n\u2018Where is Faramir?\u2019 cried Beregond in dismay. \u2018Say not that he\nhas fallen!\u2019\nIt was Gandalf that brought the first tidings. With a handful of\nhorsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line\nof wains. They were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved\nfrom the wreck of the Causeway Forts. At once he went to Denethor.\nThe Lord of the City sat now in a high chamber above the Hall of the\nWhite Tower with Pippin at his side; and through the dim windows,\nnorth and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as if to pierce the\nshadows of doom that ringed him round. Most to the North he\nlooked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art\nhis ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away.\n\u2018Is Faramir come?\u2019 he asked.\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But he still lived when I left him. Yet he is\nresolved to stay with the rearguard, lest the retreat over the Pelennor\nbecome a rout. He may, perhaps, hold his men together long enough,\nbut I doubt it. He is pitted against a foe too great. For one has come\nthat I feared.\u2019\n\u2018Not \u2013 the Dark Lord?\u2019 cried Pippin, forgetting his place in his\nterror.\nDenethor laughed bitterly. \u2018Nay, not yet, Master Peregrin! He will\nnot come save only to triumph over me when all is won. He uses\nothers as his weapons. So do all great lords, if they are wise, Master\nHalfling. Or why should I sit here in my tower and think, and watch,\nand wait, spending even my sons? For I can still wield a brand.\u2019\nHe stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he\nwas clad in mail beneath, and girt with a long sword, great-hilted in\na sheath of black and silver. \u2018Thus have I walked, and thus now for\nmany years have I slept,\u2019 he said, \u2018lest with age the body should grow\nsoft and timid.\u2019\n\u2018Yet now under the Lord of Barad-du\u02c6r the most fell of all his\ncaptains is already master of your outer walls,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018King\nof Angmar long ago, Sorcerer, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgu\u02c6l, a\nspear of terror in the hand of Sauron, shadow of despair.\u2019"}
{"843": "of the Dark Tower. Is this all that you have returned to say? Or can\nit be that you have withdrawn because you are overmatched?\u2019\nPippin trembled, fearing that Gandalf would be stung to sudden\nwrath, but his fear was needless. \u2018It might be so,\u2019 Gandalf answered\nsoftly. \u2018But our trial of strength is not yet come. And if words spoken\nof old be true, not by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from\nthe Wise is the doom that awaits him. However that may be, the\nCaptain of Despair does not press forward, yet. He rules rather\naccording to the wisdom that you have just spoken, from the rear,\ndriving his slaves in madness on before.\n\u2018Nay, I came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed;\nfor the Rammas is breached far and wide, and soon the host of\nMorgul will enter in at many points. And I came chiefly to say this.\nSoon there will be battle on the fields. A sortie must be made ready.\nLet it be of mounted men. In them lies our brief hope, for in one\nthing only is the enemy still poorly provided: he has few horsemen.\u2019\n\u2018And we also have few. Now would the coming of Rohan be in\nthe nick of time,\u2019 said Denethor.\n\u2018We are likely to see other newcomers first,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Fugi-\ntives from Cair Andros have already reached us. The isle has fallen.\nAnother army is come from the Black Gate, crossing from the\nnorth-east.\u2019\n\u2018Some have accused you, Mithrandir, of delighting to bear ill\nnews,\u2019 said Denethor, \u2018but to me this is no longer news: it was known\nto me ere nightfall yesterday. As for the sortie, I had already given\nthought to it. Let us go down.\u2019\nTime passed. At length watchers on the walls could see the retreat\nof the out-companies. Small bands of weary and often wounded men\ncame first with little order; some were running wildly as if pursued.\nAway to the eastward the distant fires flickered, and now it seemed\nthat here and there they crept across the plain. Houses and barns\nwere burning. Then from many points little rivers of red flame came\nhurrying on, winding through the gloom, converging towards the line\nof the broad road that led from the City-gate to Osgiliath.\n\u2018The enemy,\u2019 men murmured. \u2018The dike is down. Here they come\npouring through the breaches! And they carry torches, it seems.\nWhere are our own folk?\u2019\nIt drew now to evening by the hour, and the light was so dim that\neven far-sighted men upon the Citadel could discern little clearly out\nupon the fields, save only the burnings that ever multiplied, and the\nlines of fire that grew in length and speed. At last, less than a mile"}
{"844": "The watchers held their breath. \u2018Faramir must be there,\u2019 they said.\n\u2018He can govern man and beast. He will make it yet.\u2019\nNow the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs distant. Out of\nthe gloom behind a small company of horsemen galloped, all that\nwas left of the rearguard. Once again they turned at bay, facing the\noncoming lines of fire. Then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce\ncries. Horsemen of the enemy swept up. The lines of fire became\nflowing torrents, file upon file of Orcs bearing flames, and wild\nSouthron men with red banners, shouting with harsh tongues, surging\nup, overtaking the retreat. And with a piercing cry out of the dim\nsky fell the winged shadows, the Nazgu\u02c6l stooping to the kill.\nThe retreat became a rout. Already men were breaking away, flying\nwild and witless here and there, flinging away their weapons, crying\nout in fear, falling to the ground.\nAnd then a trumpet rang from the Citadel, and Denethor at last\nreleased the sortie. Drawn up within the shadow of the Gate and\nunder the looming walls outside they had waited for his signal: all\nthe mounted men that were left in the City. Now they sprang forward,\nformed, quickened to a gallop, and charged with a great shout. And\nfrom the walls an answering shout went up; for foremost on the field\nrode the swan-knights of Dol Amroth with their Prince and his blue\nbanner at their head.\n\u2018Amroth for Gondor!\u2019 they cried. \u2018Amroth to Faramir!\u2019\nLike thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the\nretreat; but one rider outran them all, swift as the wind in the grass:\nShadowfax bore him, shining, unveiled once more, a light starting\nfrom his upraised hand.\nThe Nazgu\u02c6l screeched and swept away, for their Captain was not\nyet come to challenge the white fire of his foe. The hosts of Morgul\nintent on their prey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scat-\ntering like sparks in a gale. The out-companies with a great cheer\nturned and smote their pursuers. Hunters became the hunted. The\nretreat became an onslaught. The field was strewn with stricken orcs\nand men, and a reek arose of torches cast away, sputtering out in\nswirling smoke. The cavalry rode on.\nBut Denethor did not permit them to go far. Though the enemy\nwas checked, and for the moment driven back, great forces were\nflowing in from the East. Again the trumpet rang, sounding the\nretreat. The cavalry of Gondor halted. Behind their screen the out-\ncompanies re-formed. Now steadily they came marching back. They\nreached the Gate of the City and entered, stepping proudly; and"}
{"845": "reduced. Faramir had lost a third of his men. And where was he?\nLast of all he came. His men passed in. The mounted knights\nreturned, and at their rear the banner of Dol Amroth, and the Prince.\nAnd in his arms before him on his horse he bore the body of his\nkinsman, Faramir son of Denethor, found upon the stricken field.\n\u2018Faramir! Faramir!\u2019 men cried, weeping in the streets. But he did\nnot answer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the\nCitadel and his father. Even as the Nazgu\u02c6 l had swerved aside from\nthe onset of the White Rider, there came flying a deadly dart, and\nFaramir, as he held at bay a mounted champion of Harad, had fallen\nto the earth. Only the charge of Dol Amroth had saved him from the\nred southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay.\nThe Prince Imrahil brought Faramir to the White Tower, and he\nsaid: \u2018Your son has returned, lord, after great deeds,\u2019 and he told all\nthat he had seen. But Denethor rose and looked on the face of his\nson and was silent. Then he bade them make a bed in the chamber\nand lay Faramir upon it and depart. But he himself went up alone\ninto the secret room under the summit of the Tower; and many who\nlooked up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleamed and\nflickered from the narrow windows for a while, and then flashed and\nwent out. And when Denethor descended again he went to Faramir\nand sat beside him without speaking, but the face of the Lord was\ngrey, more deathlike than his son\u2019s.\nSo now at last the City was besieged, enclosed in a ring of foes. The\nRammas was broken, and all the Pelennor abandoned to the Enemy.\nThe last word to come from outside the walls was brought by men\nflying down the northward road ere the Gate was shut. They were\nthe remnant of the guard that was kept at that point where the way\nfrom Ano\u00b4 rien and Rohan ran into the townlands. Ingold led them,\nthe same who had admitted Gandalf and Pippin less than five days\nbefore, while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning.\n\u2018There is no news of the Rohirrim,\u2019 he said. \u2018Rohan will not come\nnow. Or if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had\ntidings of has come first, from over the River by way of Andros, it is\nsaid. They are strong: battalions of Orcs of the Eye, and countless\ncompanies of Men of a new sort that we have not met before. Not\ntall, but broad and grim, bearded like dwarves, wielding great axes.\nOut of some savage land in the wide East they come, we deem. They\nhold the northward road; and many have passed on into Ano\u00b4rien.\nThe Rohirrim cannot come.\u2019"}

The\nnumbers that had already passed over the River could not be guessed\nin the darkness, but when morning, or its dim shadow, stole over the\nplain, it was seen that even fear by night had scarcely over-counted\nthem. The plain was dark with their marching companies, and as far\nas eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted, like a foul fungus-\ngrowth, all about the beleaguered city great camps of tents, black or\nsombre red.\nBusy as ants hurrying orcs were digging, digging lines of deep\ntrenches in a huge ring, just out of bowshot from the walls; and as\nthe trenches were made each was filled with fire, though how it was\nkindled or fed, by art or devilry, none could see. All day the labour\nwent forward, while the men of Minas Tirith looked on, unable to\nhinder it. And as each length of trench was completed, they could\nsee great wains approaching; and soon yet more companies of the\nenemy were swiftly setting up, each behind the cover of a trench,\ngreat engines for the casting of missiles. There were none upon the\nCity walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work.\nAt first men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices. For\nthe main wall of the City was of great height and marvellous thickness,\nbuilt ere the power and craft of Nu\u00b4menor waned in exile; and its\noutward face was like to the Tower of Orthanc, hard and dark and\nsmooth, unconquerable by steel or fire, unbreakable except by some\nconvulsion that would rend the very earth on which it stood.\n\u2018Nay,\u2019 they said, \u2018not if the Nameless One himself should come,\nnot even he could enter here while we yet live.\u2019 But some answered:\n\u2018While we yet live? How long? He has a weapon that has brought\nlow many strong places since the world began. Hunger. The roads\nare cut. Rohan will not come.\u2019\nBut the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall. It\nwas no brigand or orc-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the\nLord of Mordor\u2019s greatest foe. A power and mind of malice guided\nit. As soon as the great catapults were set, with many yells and the\ncreaking of rope and winch, they began to throw missiles marvellously\nhigh, so that they passed right above the battlement and fell thudding\nwithin the first circle of the City; and many of them by some secret\nart burst into flame as they came toppling down.\nSoon there was great peril of fire behind the wall, and all who\ncould be spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many\nplaces.

But marred and dishonoured\nas they were, it often chanced that thus a man would see again the\nface of someone that he had known, who had walked proudly once\nin arms, or tilled the fields, or ridden in upon a holiday from the\ngreen vales in the hills.\nIn vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed\nbefore the Gate. Curses they heeded not, nor understood the tongues\nof western men, crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion-birds.\nBut soon there were few left in Minas Tirith who had the heart to\nstand up and defy the hosts of Mordor. For yet another weapon,\nswifter than hunger, the Lord of the Dark Tower had: dread and\ndespair.\nThe Nazgu\u02c6l came again, and as their Dark Lord now grew and\nput forth his strength, so their voices, which uttered only his will and\nhis malice, were filled with evil and horror. Ever they circled above\nthe City, like vultures that expect their fill of doomed men\u2019s flesh.\nOut of sight and shot they flew, and yet were ever present, and their\ndeadly voices rent the air.

Nay, nay, whatever may\nnow betide in war, my line too is ending, even the House of the\nStewards has failed.

Tirelessly he strode from\nCitadel to Gate, from north to south about the wall; and with him\nwent the Prince of Dol Amroth in his shining mail. For he and his\nknights still held themselves like lords in whom the race of Nu\u00b4menor\nran true. Men that saw them whispered saying: \u2018Belike the old tales\nspeak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that folk, for the\npeople of Nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago.\u2019 And then one\nwould sing amid the gloom some staves of the Lay of Nimrodel, or\nother songs of the Vale of Anduin out of vanished years.\nAnd yet \u2013 when they had gone, the shadows closed on men again,\nand their hearts went cold, and the valour of Gondor withered into\nash. And so slowly they passed out of a dim day of fears into the\ndarkness of a desperate night. Fires now raged unchecked in the first\ncircle of the City, and the garrison upon the outer wall was already\nin many places cut off from retreat. But the faithful who remained\nthere at their posts were few; most had fled beyond the second gate.\nFar behind the battle the River had been swiftly bridged, and all\nday more force and gear of war had poured across. Now at last in\nthe middle night the assault was loosed. The vanguard passed through\nthe trenches of fire by many devious paths that had been left between\nthem.

But\nindeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage,\nthough the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of\nsuch skill as Gondor once had boasted.

You are still the Lord and Steward. Not all will\nfollow Mithrandir. Men are flying from the walls and leaving them\nunmanned.\u2019\n\u2018Why? Why do the fools fly?\u2019 said Denethor. \u2018Better to burn sooner\nthan late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will\ngo now to my pyre. To my pyre! No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.\nNo tomb! No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We will burn like\nheathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the West. The\nWest has failed. Go back and burn!\u2019\nThe messengers without bow or answer turned and fled.\nNow Denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of Faramir\nthat he had held. \u2018He is burning, already burning,\u2019 he said sadly.\n\u2018The house of his spirit crumbles.\u2019 Then stepping softly towards\nPippin he looked down at him.\n\u2018Farewell!\u2019 he said. \u2018Farewell, Peregrin son of Paladin! Your service\nhas been short, and now it is drawing to an end. I release you\nfrom the little that remains. Go now, and die in what way seems\nbest to you. And with whom you will, even that friend whose folly\nbrought you to this death. Send for my servants and then go. Fare-\nwell!\u2019\n\u2018I will not say farewell, my lord,\u2019 said Pippin kneeling. And then\nsuddenly hobbit-like once more, he stood up and looked the old man\nin the eyes. \u2018I will take your leave, sir,\u2019 he said; \u2018for I want to see\nGandalf very much indeed.

Send for my servants!\u2019 He turned back to Faramir.\nPippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six\nmen of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the\nsummons. But in a quiet voice Denethor bade them lay warm cover-\nlets on Faramir\u2019s bed and take it up. And they did so, and lifting up\nthe bed they bore it from the chamber. Slowly they paced to trouble\nthe fevered man as little as might be, and Denethor, now bending\non a staff, followed them; and last came Pippin."}

Softly they paced the great courtyard, and at a\nword from Denethor halted beside the Withered Tree.\nAll was silent, save for the rumour of war in the City down below,\nand they heard the water dripping sadly from the dead branches into\nthe dark pool. Then they went on through the Citadel gate, where\nthe sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by.\nTurning westward they came at length to a door in the rearward wall\nof the sixth circle. Fen Hollen it was called, for it was kept ever shut\nsave at times of funeral, and only the Lord of the City might use that\nway, or those who bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses\nof the dead. Beyond it went a winding road that descended in many\ncurves down to the narrow land under the shadow of Mindolluin\u2019s\nprecipice where stood the mansions of the dead Kings and of their\nStewards.\nA porter sat in a little house beside the way, and with fear in his\neyes he came forth bearing a lantern in his hand. At the Lord\u2019s\ncommand he unlocked the door, and silently it swung back; and they\npassed through, taking the lantern from his hand. It was dark on\nthe climbing road between ancient walls and many-pillared balusters\nlooming in the swaying lantern-beam. Their slow feet echoed as they\nwalked down, down, until at last they came to the Silent Street, Rath\nD\u00b4\u0131nen, between pale domes and empty halls and images of men long\ndead; and they entered into the House of the Stewards and set down\ntheir burden.\nThere Pippin, staring uneasily about him, saw that he was in a\nwide vaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that\nthe little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls. And dimly to be seen\nwere many rows of tables, carved of marble; and upon each table lay\na sleeping form, hands folded, head pillowed upon stone. But one\ntable near at hand stood broad and bare. Upon it at a sign from\nDenethor they laid Faramir and his father side by side, and covered\nthem with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads as\nmourners beside a bed of death. Then Denethor spoke in a low voice.\n\u2018Here we will wait,\u2019 he said. \u2018But send not for the embalmers.\nBring us wood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath;\nand pour oil upon it.

I must run. I will return if I can.\u2019\nHe ran on, down, down towards the outer city. Men flying back\nfrom the burning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and\nshouted, but he paid no heed. At last he was through the Second\nGate, beyond which great fires leaped up between the walls. Yet it\nseemed strangely silent. No noise or shouts of battle or din of arms\ncould be heard. Then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great\nshock, and a deep echoing boom.

There came great beasts, like\nmoving houses in the red and fitful light, the mu\u02c6makil of the Harad\ndragging through the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines.\nYet their Captain cared not greatly what they did or how many might\nbe slain: their purpose was only to test the strength of the defence\nand to keep the men of Gondor busy in many places. It was against\nthe Gate that he would throw his heaviest weight. Very strong it\nmight be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and\nbastions of indomitable stone, yet it was the key, the weakest point\nin all that high and impenetrable wall.\nThe drums rolled louder. Fires leaped up. Great engines crawled\nacross the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree\na hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it\nbeen forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head,\nfounded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf;\non it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the\nHammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs sur-\nrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it.\nBut about the Gate resistance still was stout, and there the knights\nof Dol Amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay. Shot\nand dart fell thick; siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like\ntorches. All before the walls on either side of the Gate the ground\nwas choked with wreck and with bodies of the slain; yet still driven\nas by a madness more and more came up.\nGrond crawled on. Upon its housing no fire would catch; and\nthough now and again some great beast that hauled it would go mad\nand spread stamping ruin among the orcs innumerable that guarded\nit, their bodies were cast aside from its path and others took their\nplace.\nGrond crawled on. The drums rolled wildly. Over the hills of slain\na hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall, hooded, cloaked in black.\nSlowly, trampling the fallen, he rode forth, heeding no longer any\ndart. He halted and held up a long pale sword. And as he did so a\ngreat fear fell on all, defender and foe alike; and the hands of men\ndrooped to their sides, and no bow sang. For a moment all was still.\nThe drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush Grond was hurled\nforward by huge hands. It reached the Gate. It swung. A deep boom\nrumbled through the City like thunder running in the clouds. But\nthe doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke.\nThen the Black Captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a"}

As if stricken by some\nblasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning,\nand the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.\nIn rode the Lord of the Nazgu\u02c6l. A great black shape against the\nfires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In\nrode the Lord of the Nazgu\u02c6 l, under the archway that no enemy ever\nyet had passed, and all fled before his face.\nAll save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the\nGate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among\nthe free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast\nas a graven image in Rath D\u00b4\u0131nen.\n\u2018You cannot enter here,\u2019 said Gandalf, and the huge shadow\nhalted. \u2018Go back to the abyss prepared for you!

The red fires shone\nbetween it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth\nunseen there came a deadly laughter.\n\u2018Old fool!\u2019 he said. \u2018Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know\nDeath when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!\u2019 And with that\nhe lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.\nGandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in\nsome courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed,\nrecking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that\nin the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.\nAnd as if in answer there came from far away another note.

{"854": "Chapter 5\nTHE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM\nIt was dark and Merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground\nrolled in a blanket; yet though the night was airless and windless, all\nabout him hidden trees were sighing softly. He lifted his head. Then\nhe heard it again: a sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and\nmountain-steps. The throb would cease suddenly and then be taken\nup again at some other point, now nearer, now further off. He won-\ndered if the watchmen had heard it.\nHe could not see them, but he knew that all round him were the\ncompanies of the Rohirrim. He could smell the horses in the dark,\nand could hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-\ncovered ground. The host was bivouacked in the pine-woods that\nclustered about Eilenach Beacon, a tall hill standing up from the long\nridges of the Dru\u00b4adan Forest that lay beside the great road in East\nAno\u00b4 rien.\nTired as he was Merry could not sleep. He had ridden now for\nfour days on end, and the ever-deepening gloom had slowly weighed\ndown his heart. He began to wonder why he had been so eager to\ncome, when he had been given every excuse, even his lord\u2019s com-\nmand, to stay behind. He wondered, too, if the old King knew that\nhe had been disobeyed and was angry. Perhaps not. There seemed\nto be some understanding between Dernhelm and Elfhelm, the Mar-\nshal who commanded the e\u00b4ored in which they were riding. He and\nall his men ignored Merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke.\nHe might have been just another bag that Dernhelm was carrying.\nDernhelm was no comfort: he never spoke to anyone. Merry felt\nsmall, unwanted, and lonely. Now the time was anxious, and the\nhost was in peril. They were less than a day\u2019s ride from the out-walls\nof Minas Tirith that encircled the townlands.

Presently he heard voices speaking low, and he\nsaw dim half-shrouded lanterns passing through the trees. Men\nnearby began to move uncertainly in the dark.\nA tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him, cursing the tree-\nroots. He recognized the voice of Elfhelm the Marshal.\n\u2018I am not a tree-root, Sir,\u2019 he said, \u2018nor a bag, but a bruised hobbit.\nThe least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot.\u2019\n\u2018Anything that can keep so in this devil\u2019s mirk,\u2019 answered Elfhelm.\n\u2018But my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness:\norders may come for a sudden move.\u2019\n\u2018Is the enemy coming then?\u2019 asked Merry anxiously. \u2018Are those\ntheir drums? I began to think I was imagining them, as no one else\nseemed to take any notice of them.\u2019\n\u2018Nay, nay,\u2019 said Elfhelm, \u2018the enemy is on the road not in the hills.\nYou hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods: thus they talk\ntogether from afar. They still haunt Dru\u00b4adan Forest, it is said. Rem-\nnants of an older time they be, living few and secretly, wild and wary\nas the beasts. They go not to war with Gondor or the Mark; but now\nthey are troubled by the darkness and the coming of the orcs: they\nfear lest the Dark Years be returning, as seems likely enough. Let us\nbe thankful that they are not hunting us: for they use poisoned arrows,\nit is said, and they are woodcrafty beyond compare. But they have\noffered their services to The\u00b4oden. Even now one of their headmen\nis being taken to the king. Yonder go the lights. So much I have\nheard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my lord\u2019s\ncommands.

Waiting\nwas unbearable. He longed to know what was going to happen. He\ngot up and soon was walking warily in pursuit of the last lantern\nbefore it disappeared among the trees.\nPresently he came to an open space where a small tent had been\nset up for the king under a great tree. A large lantern, covered above,\nwas hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below.

His voice\nwas deep and guttural, yet to Merry\u2019s surprise he spoke the Common\nSpeech, though in a halting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled\nwith it.\n\u2018No, father of Horse-men,\u2019 he said, \u2018we fight not. Hunt only. Kill\ngorgu\u02c6n in woods, hate orc-folk. You hate gorgu\u02c6n too. We help as we\ncan. Wild Men have long ears and long eyes; know all paths. Wild\nMen live here before Stone-houses; before Tall Men come up out of\nWater.\u2019\n\u2018But our need is for aid in battle,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018How will you and\nyour folk help us?\u2019\n\u2018Bring news,\u2019 said the Wild Man. \u2018We look out from hills. We\nclimb big mountain and look down. Stone-city is shut. Fire burns\nthere outside; now inside too. You wish to come there? Then you\nmust be quick. But gorgu\u02c6n and men out of far-away,\u2019 he waved a\nshort gnarled arm eastward, \u2018sit on horse-road. Very many, more\nthan Horse-men.\u2019\n\u2018How do you know that?\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer.\nThe old man\u2019s flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, but his\nvoice was sullen with displeasure. \u2018Wild Men are wild, free, but not\nchildren,\u2019 he answered. \u2018I am great headman, Gha\u02c6n-buri-Gha\u02c6n. I\ncount many things: stars in sky, leaves on trees, men in the dark.\nYou have a score of scores counted ten times and five. They have\nmore. Big fight, and who will win? And many more walk round walls\nof Stone-houses.\u2019\n\u2018Alas! he speaks all too shrewdly,\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018And our scouts\nsay that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road. We cannot\nsweep them away in sudden onset.\u2019\n\u2018And yet we need great haste,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer. \u2018Mundburg is on fire!\u2019\n\u2018Let Gha\u02c6n-buri-Gha\u02c6n finish!\u2019 said the Wild Man. \u2018More than one\nroad he knows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no\ngorgu\u02c6n walk, only Wild Men and beasts. Many paths were made when\nStonehouse-folk were stronger. They carved hills as hunters carve\nbeast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate stone for food. They went\nthrough Dru\u00b4adan to Rimmon with great wains. They go no longer.\nRoad is forgotten, but not by Wild Men.

If the\nStone-city falls, then we shall have no returning. If it is saved, then\nthe orc-host itself will be cut off. If you are faithful, Gha\u02c6n-buri-Gha\u02c6n,\nthen we will give you rich reward, and you shall have the friendship\nof the Mark for ever.\u2019\n\u2018Dead men are not friends to living men, and give them no gifts,\u2019\nsaid the Wild Man. \u2018But if you live after the Darkness, then leave\nWild Men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any\nmore.

Wild Man could walk from\nhere to D\u02c6\u0131n between sunrise and noon.\u2019\n\u2018Then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders,\u2019 said\nE\u00b4omer; \u2018but we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all. Things\nunforeseen may hinder us, and if our host is all strung out, it will be\nlong ere it can be set in order when we issue from the hills. What is\nthe hour now?\u2019\n\u2018Who knows?\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018All is night now.\u2019\n\u2018It is all dark, but it is not all night,\u2019 said Gha\u02c6n. \u2018When Sun\ncomes we feel her, even when she is hidden. Already she climbs over\nEast-mountains. It is the opening of day in the sky-fields.\u2019\n\u2018Then we must set out as soon as may be,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018Even so\nwe cannot hope to come to Gondor\u2019s aid today.\u2019\nMerry waited to hear no more, but slipped away to get ready for\nthe summons to the march.

The start\nhad been slower than was hoped, for it had taken time for the Riders,\nwalking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly\nwooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden\nStonewain Valley. It was late in the afternoon when the leaders came\nto wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of Amon\nD\u02c6\u0131n, and masking a great gap in the line of hills that from Nardol to\nD\u02c6\u0131n ran east and west. Through the gap the forgotten wain-road long\nago had run down, back into the main horse-way from the City\nthrough Ano\u00b4 rien; but now for many lives of men trees had had their\nway with it, and it had vanished, broken and buried under the leaves\nof uncounted years. But the thickets offered to the Riders their last\nhope of cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them\nlay the road and the plains of Anduin, while east and southwards the\nslopes were bare and rocky, as the writhen hills gathered themselves\ntogether and climbed up, bastion upon bastion, into the great mass\nand shoulders of Mindolluin.\nThe leading company was halted, and as those behind filed up\nout of the trough of the Stonewain Valley they spread out and passed\nto camping-places under the grey trees. The king summoned the\ncaptains to council. E\u00b4 omer sent out scouts to spy upon the road; but\nold Gha\u02c6n shook his head.\n\u2018No good to send Horse-men,\u2019 he said. \u2018Wild Men have already\nseen all that can be seen in the bad air. They will come soon and\nspeak to me here.\u2019\nThe captains came; and then out of the trees crept warily other\npu\u00b4kel-shapes so like old Gha\u02c6n that Merry could hardly tell them\napart. They spoke to Gha\u02c6n in a strange throaty language.\nPresently Gha\u02c6n turned to the king. \u2018Wild Men say many things,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018First, be wary! Still many men in camp beyond D\u02c6\u0131n, an\nhour\u2019s walk yonder,\u2019 he waved his arm west towards the black beacon.\n\u2018But none to see between here and Stone-folk\u2019s new walls.

But what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show.\u2019\nGha\u02c6n-buri-Gha\u02c6n squatted down and touched the earth with his\nhorny brow in token of farewell. Then he got up as if to depart. But\nsuddenly he stood looking up like some startled woodland animal\nsnuffling a strange air. A light came in his eyes.\n\u2018Wind is changing!\u2019 he cried, and with that, in a twinkling as it\nseemed, he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms, never to\nbe seen by any Rider of Rohan again. Not long after far away eastward\nthe faint drums throbbed again. Yet to no heart in all the host came\nany fear that the Wild Men were unfaithful, strange and unlovely\nthough they might appear.\n\u2018We need no further guidance,\u2019 said Elfhelm; \u2018for there are riders\nin the host who have ridden down to Mundburg in days of peace. I\nfor one. When we come to the road it will veer south, and there will\nlie before us still seven leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands.\nAlong most of that way there is much grass on either side of the road.\nOn that stretch the errand-riders of Gondor reckoned to make their\ngreatest speed. We may ride it swiftly and without great rumour.\u2019\n\u2018Then since we must look for fell deeds and the need of all our\nstrength,\u2019 said E\u00b4omer, \u2018I counsel that we rest now, and set out hence\nby night, and so time our going that we come upon the fields when\ntomorrow is as light as it will be, or when our lord gives the signal.\u2019\nTo this the king assented, and the captains departed. But soon\nElfhelm returned. \u2018The scouts have found naught to report beyond\nthe Grey Wood, lord,\u2019 he said, \u2018save two men only: two dead men\nand two dead horses.\u2019\n\u2018Well?\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018What of it?\u2019\n\u2018This, lord: they were errand-riders of Gondor; Hirgon was one\nmaybe. At least his hand still clasped the Red Arrow, but his head was\nhewn off. And this also: it would seem by the signs that they were fleeing\nwestward when they fell. As I read it, they found the enemy already on\nthe out-wall, or assailing it, when they returned \u2013 and that would be\ntwo nights ago, if they used fresh horses from the posts, as is their wont.\nThey could not reach the City and turned back.\u2019\n\u2018Alas!\u2019 said The\u00b4oden. \u2018Then Denethor has heard no news of our\nriding and will despair of our coming.\u2019\n\u2018Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer. \u2018And\nmayhapinthistimeshalltheoldsawbeprovedtruerthaneverbefore"}

Far away and almost straight ahead there was a\nred glow under the black sky and the sides of the great mountain\nloomed dark against it. They were drawing near the Rammas of the\nPelennor; but the day was not yet come.\nThe king rode in the midst of the leading company, his household-\nmen about him. Elfhelm\u2019s e\u00b4ored came next; and now Merry noticed\nthat Dernhelm had left his place and in the darkness was moving\nsteadily forward, until at last he was riding just in rear of the king\u2019s\nguard. There came a check. Merry heard voices in front speaking\nsoftly. Out-riders had come back who had ventured forward almost\nto the wall. They came to the king.\n\u2018There are great fires, lord,\u2019 said one. \u2018The City is all set about\nwith flame, and the field is full of foes. But all seem drawn off to the\nassault. As well as we could guess, there are few left upon the out-wall,\nand they are heedless, busy in destruction.\u2019\n\u2018Do you remember the Wild Man\u2019s words, lord?\u2019 said another. \u2018I\nlive upon the open Wold in days of peace; W\u00b4\u0131dfara is my name, and\nto me also the air brings messages. Already the wind is turning. There\ncomes a breath out of the South; there is a sea-tang in it, faint though\nit be. The morning will bring new things.

Dernhelm kept close to the king, though Elfhelm\u2019s\ncompany was away on the right. Grimbold\u2019s men turned aside and\npassed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward.\nMerry peered from behind Dernhelm\u2019s back. Far away, maybe ten\nmiles or more, there was a great burning, but between it and the\nRiders lines of fire blazed in a vast crescent, at the nearest point less\nthan a league distant. He could make out little more on the dark\nplain, and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning, nor felt any\nwind, changed or unchanged.\nNow silently the host of Rohan moved forward into the field of\nGondor, pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through\nbreaches in a dike that men have thought secure. But the mind and\nwill of the Black Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and\nas yet no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.\nAfter a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to\ncome between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still they\nwere unchallenged, and still The\u00b4oden gave no signal. At last he halted\nonce again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the\nair and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the\nking sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of\nMinas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He\nseemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great\nweight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly.\nTime seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late\nwas worse than never! Perhaps The\u00b4oden would quail, bow his old\nhead, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.\nThen suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind\nwas in his face! Light was glimmering.

Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran\nlike new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a\ngod of old, even as Orome\u00a8 the Great in the battle of the Valar when\nthe world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it\nshone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about\nthe white feet of his steed.

But his arm\nwas long. He was still in command, wielding great powers. King,\nRingwraith, Lord of the Nazgu\u02c6l, he had many weapons.

Yet one stood there still: Dernhelm the young,\nfaithful beyond fear; and he wept, for he had loved his lord as a\nfather. Right through the charge Merry had been borne unharmed\nbehind him, until the Shadow came; and then Windfola had thrown\nthem in his terror, and now ran wild upon the plain. Merry crawled\non all fours like a dazed beast, and such a horror was on him that\nhe was blind and sick.\n\u2018King\u2019s man! King\u2019s man!\u2019 his heart cried within him. \u2018You must\nstay by him. As a father you shall be to me, you said.\u2019 But his will"}
{"865": "Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard\nDernhelm speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling some\nother voice that he had known.\n\u2018Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in\npeace!\u2019\nA cold voice answered: \u2018Come not between the Nazgu\u02c6l and his\nprey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to\nthe houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall\nbe devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.\u2019\nA sword rang as it was drawn. \u2018Do what you will; but I will hinder\nit, if I may.\u2019\n\u2018Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!\u2019\nThen Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. It\nseemed that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring\nof steel. \u2018But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. E\u00b4 owyn\nI am, E\u00b4 omund\u2019s daughter. You stand between me and my lord and\nkin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I\nwill smite you, if you touch him.\u2019\nThe winged creature screamed at her, but the Ringwraith made\nno answer, and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement\nfor a moment conquered Merry\u2019s fear. He opened his eyes and the\nblackness was lifted from them. There some paces from him sat\nthe great beast, and all seemed dark about it, and above it loomed\nthe Nazgu\u02c6l Lord like a shadow of despair. A little to the left facing\nthem stood she whom he had called Dernhelm. But the helm of her\nsecrecy had fallen from her, and her bright hair, released from its\nbonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders. Her eyes grey as\nthe sea were hard and fell, and yet tears were on her cheek. A sword\nwas in her hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her\nenemy\u2019s eyes.\nE\u00b4 owyn it was, and Dernhelm also. For into Merry\u2019s mind flashed\nthe memory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow:\nthe face of one that goes seeking death, having no hope. Pity filled\nhis heart and great wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage\nof his race awoke. He clenched his hand. She should not die, so fair,\nso desperate! At least she should not die alone, unaided.\nThe face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he\nhardly dared to move, dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on\nhim. Slowly, slowly he began to crawl aside; but the Black Captain,\nin doubt and malice intent upon the woman before him, heeded him\nno more than a worm in the mud.\nSuddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings, and the wind of"}

The outstretched neck she clove asunder, and the\nhewn head fell like a stone. Backward she sprang as the huge shape\ncrashed to ruin, vast wings outspread, crumpled on the earth; and\nwith its fall the shadow passed away. A light fell about her, and her\nhair shone in the sunrise.\nOut of the wreck rose the Black Rider, tall and threatening, tower-\ning above her. With a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like\nvenom he let fall his mace. Her shield was shivered in many pieces,\nand her arm was broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent over\nher like a cloud, and his eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill.\nBut suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain,\nand his stroke went wide, driving into the ground. Merry\u2019s sword\nhad stabbed him from behind, shearing through the black mantle,\nand passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced the sinew behind\nhis mighty knee.\n\u2018E\u00b4owyn! E\u00b4 owyn!\u2019 cried Merry. Then tottering, struggling up, with\nher last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as\nthe great shoulders bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into\nmany shards. The crown rolled away with a clang. E\u00b4 owyn fell forward\nupon her fallen foe. But lo! the mantle and hauberk were empty.\nShapeless they lay now on the ground, torn and tumbled; and a cry\nwent up into the shuddering air, and faded to a shrill wailing, passing\nwith the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, and was swallowed\nup, and was never heard again in that age of this world.\nAnd there stood Meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain,\nblinking like an owl in the daylight, for tears blinded him; and through\na mist he looked on E\u00b4owyn\u2019s fair head, as she lay and did not move;\nand he looked on the face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory.\nFor Snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again; yet he\nwas the bane of his master.\nThen Merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it, and lo! The\u00b4oden\nopened his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice\nthough laboured.\n\u2018Farewell, Master Holbytla!\u2019 he said. \u2018My body is broken. I go to\nmy fathers. And even in their mighty company I shall not now be\nashamed. I felled the black serpent. A grim morn, and a glad day,\nand a golden sunset!\u2019\nMerry could not speak, but wept anew. \u2018Forgive me, lord,\u2019 he said\nat last, \u2018if I broke your command, and yet have done no more in"}
{"867": "not be denied. Live now in blessedness; and when you sit in peace\nwith your pipe, think of me! For never now shall I sit with you in\nMeduseld, as I promised, or listen to your herb-lore.\u2019 He closed his\neyes, and Merry bowed beside him. Presently he spoke again. \u2018Where\nis E\u00b4omer? For my eyes darken, and I would see him ere I go. He\nmust be king after me. And I would send word to E\u00b4 owyn. She, she\nwould not have me leave her, and now I shall not see her again,\ndearer than daughter.\u2019\n\u2018Lord, lord,\u2019 began Merry brokenly, \u2018she is\u2014\u2014\u2019; but at that\nmoment there was a great clamour, and all about them horns and\ntrumpets were blowing. Merry looked round: he had forgotten the\nwar, and all the world beside, and many hours it seemed since the\nking rode to his fall, though in truth it was only a little while. But\nnow he saw that they were in danger of being caught in the very\nmidst of the great battle that would soon be joined.\nNew forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the\nRiver; and from under the walls came the legions of Morgul; and\nfrom the southward fields came footmen of Harad with horsemen\nbefore them, and behind them rose the huge backs of the mu\u02c6makil\nwith war-towers upon them. But northward the white crest of E\u00b4omer\nled the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again gathered and\nmarshalled; and out of the City came all the strength of men that\nwas in it, and the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne in the van,\ndriving the enemy from the Gate.\nFor a moment the thought flitted through Merry\u2019s mind: \u2018Where\nis Gandalf ? Is he not here? Could he not have saved the king and\nE\u00b4owyn?\u2019 But thereupon E\u00b4omer rode up in haste, and with him came\nthe knights of the household that still lived and had now mastered\ntheir horses. They looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell beast\nthat lay there; and their steeds would not go near. But E\u00b4omer leaped\nfrom the saddle, and grief and dismay fell upon him as he came to\nthe king\u2019s side and stood there in silence.\nThen one of the knights took the king\u2019s banner from the hand of\nGuthla\u00b4f the banner-bearer who lay dead, and he lifted it up. Slowly\nThe\u00b4oden opened his eyes. Seeing the banner he made a sign that it\nshould be given to E\u00b4omer.\n\u2018Hail, King of the Mark!\u2019 he said. \u2018Ride now to victory! Bid E\u00b4 owyn\nfarewell!\u2019 And so he died, and knew not that E\u00b4 owyn lay near him. And\nthose who stood by wept, crying: \u2018The\u00b4oden King! The\u00b4oden King!\u2019\nBut E\u00b4 omer said to them:\nMourn not overmuch! Mighty was the fallen,"}
{"868": "Yet he himself wept as he spoke. \u2018Let his knights remain here,\u2019 he\nsaid, \u2018and bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle ride\nover it! Yea, and all these other of the king\u2019s men that lie here.\u2019 And\nhe looked at the slain, recalling their names. Then suddenly he beheld\nhis sister E\u00b4owyn as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment\nas a man who is pierced in the midst of a cry by an arrow through\nthe heart; and then his face went deathly white, and a cold fury rose\nin him, so that all speech failed him for a while. A fey mood took\nhim.\n\u2018E\u00b4owyn, E\u00b4 owyn!\u2019 he cried at last. \u2018E\u00b4 owyn, how come you here?\nWhat madness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us\nall!\u2019\nThen without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the\nmen of the City, he spurred headlong back to the front of the great\nhost, and blew a horn, and cried aloud for the onset. Over the field\nrang his clear voice calling: \u2018Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world\u2019s\nending!\u2019\nAnd with that the host began to move. But the Rohirrim sang no\nmore. Death they cried with one voice loud and terrible, and gathering\nspeed like a great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and\npassed, roaring away southwards.\nAnd still Meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his\ntears, and no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him.\nHe brushed away the tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield\nthat E\u00b4owyn had given him, and he slung it at his back. Then he\nlooked for his sword that he had let fall; for even as he struck his\nblow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use his left hand.\nAnd behold! there lay his weapon, but the blade was smoking like a\ndry branch that has been thrust in a fire; and as he watched it, it\nwrithed and withered and was consumed.\nSo passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse.\nBut glad would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly\nlong ago in the North-kingdom when the Du\u00b4nedain were young, and\nchief among their foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer\nking. No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it,\nwould have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead\nflesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.\nMen now raised the king, and laying cloaks upon spear-truncheons\nthey made shift to bear him away towards the City; and others lifted\nE\u00b4owyn gently up and bore her after him.

{"869": "them. So they laid them apart from their foes and the fell beast and\nset spears about them. And afterwards when all was over men\nreturned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of the beast;\nbut for Snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which\nwas carved in the tongues of Gondor and the Mark:\nFaithful servant yet master\u2019s bane,\nLightfoot\u2019s foal, swift Snowmane.\nGreen and long grew the grass on Snowmane\u2019s Howe, but ever black\nand bare was the ground where the beast was burned.\nNow slowly and sadly Merry walked beside the bearers, and he\ngave no more heed to the battle. He was weary and full of pain, and\nhis limbs trembled as with a chill. A great rain came out of the Sea,\nand it seemed that all things wept for The\u00b4oden and E\u00b4owyn, quenching\nthe fires in the City with grey tears. It was through a mist that pres-\nently he saw the van of the men of Gondor approaching. Imrahil,\nPrince of Dol Amroth, rode up and drew rein before them.\n\u2018What burden do you bear, Men of Rohan?\u2019 he cried.\n\u2018The\u00b4oden King,\u2019 they answered. \u2018He is dead. But E\u00b4omer King\nnow rides in the battle: he with the white crest in the wind.\u2019\nThen the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in\nhonour of the king and his great onset; and he wept. And rising he\nlooked then on E\u00b4 owyn and was amazed. \u2018Surely, here is a woman?\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Have even the women of the Rohirrim come to war in our\nneed?\u2019\n\u2018Nay! One only,\u2019 they answered. \u2018The Lady E\u00b4 owyn is she, sister\nof E\u00b4 omer; and we knew naught of her riding until this hour, and\ngreatly we rue it.\u2019\nThen the prince seeing her beauty, though her face was pale and\ncold, touched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her. \u2018Men\nof Rohan!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt,\nto the death maybe, but I deem that she yet lives.\u2019 And he held the\nbright-burnished vambrace that was upon his arm before her cold\nlips, and behold! a little mist was laid on it hardly to be seen.\n\u2018Haste now is needed,\u2019 he said, and he sent one riding back swiftly\nto the City to bring aid.

The great\nwrath of his onset had utterly overthrown the front of his enemies,\nand great wedges of his Riders had passed clear through the ranks\nof the Southrons, discomfiting their horsemen and riding their foot-\nmen to ruin. But wherever the mu\u02c6makil came there the horses would\nnot go, but blenched and swerved away; and the great monsters were\nunfought, and stood like towers of defence, and the Haradrim rallied\nabout them. And if the Rohirrim at their onset were thrice out-\nnumbered by the Haradrim alone, soon their case became worse; for\nnew strength came now streaming to the field out of Osgiliath. There\nthey had been mustered for the sack of the City and the rape of\nGondor, waiting on the call of their Captain. He now was destroyed;\nbut Gothmog the lieutenant of Morgul had flung them into the fray;\nEasterlings with axes, and Variags of Khand, Southrons in scarlet,\nand out of Far Harad black men like half-trolls with white eyes and\nred tongues. Some now hastened up behind the Rohirrim, others\nheld westward to hold off the forces of Gondor and prevent their\njoining with Rohan.\nIt was even as the day thus began to turn against Gondor and\ntheir hope wavered that a new cry went up in the City, it being then\nmid-morning, and a great wind blowing, and the rain flying north,\nand the sun shining. In that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar\na new sight of fear, and their last hope left them.\nFor Anduin, from the bend at the Harlond, so flowed that from the\nCity men could look down it lengthwise for some leagues, and the far-\nsighted could see any ships that approached. And looking thither they\ncried in dismay; for black against the glittering stream they beheld a\nfleet borne up on the wind: dromunds, and ships of great draught with\nmany oars, and with black sails bellying in the breeze.\n\u2018The Corsairs of Umbar!\u2019 men shouted. \u2018The Corsairs of Umbar!\nLook! The Corsairs of Umbar are coming! So Belfalas is taken, and\nthe Ethir, and Lebennin is gone. The Corsairs are upon us!

For E\u00b4omer was now\nscarcely a mile from the Harlond, and a great press of his first foes\nwas between him and the haven there, while new foes came swirling\nbehind, cutting him off from the Prince. Now he looked to the River,\nand hope died in his heart, and the wind that he had blessed he now\ncalled accursed. But the hosts of Mordor were enheartened, and filled\nwith a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset.\nStern now was E\u00b4omer\u2019s mood, and his mind clear again. He let\nblow the horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither;\nfor he thought to make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and\nfight there on foot till all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of\nPelennor, though no man should be left in the West to remember\nthe last King of the Mark. So he rode to a green hillock and there\nset his banner, and the White Horse ran rippling in the wind.\nOut of doubt, out of dark to the day\u2019s rising\nI came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.\nTo hope\u2019s end I rode and to heart\u2019s breaking:\nNow for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall!\nThese staves he spoke, yet he laughed as he said them. For once\nmore lust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he\nwas young, and he was king: the lord of a fell people. And lo! even\nas he laughed at despair he looked out again on the black ships, and\nhe lifted up his sword to defy them.\nAnd then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast his sword\nup in the sunlight and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his\ngaze, and behold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke,\nand the wind displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There\nflowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but Seven Stars\nwere about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that\nno lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in\nthe sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of\nElrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought\nof mithril and gold.\nThus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur\u2019s heir, out\nof the Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the\nkingdom of Gondor; and the mirth of the Rohirrim was a torrent of\nlaughterandaflashingofswords,andthejoyandwonderoftheCity"}

South\nstrode E\u00b4 omer and men fled before his face, and they were caught\nbetween the hammer and the anvil. For now men leaped from the\nships to the quays of the Harlond and swept north like a storm. There\ncame Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, and Halbarad with the\nstandard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their brow, and the\ndour-handed Du\u00b4nedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great valour\nof the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South. But\nbefore all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, Andu\u00b4ril like a\nnew fire kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old; and upon his\nbrow was the Star of Elendil.\nAnd so at length E\u00b4 omer and Aragorn met in the midst of the\nbattle, and they leaned on their swords and looked on one another\nand were glad.\n\u2018Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor lay between\nus,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Did I not say so at the Hornburg?\u2019\n\u2018So you spoke,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer, \u2018but hope oft deceives, and I knew not\nthen that you were a man foresighted.

Much loss and sorrow has befallen us.\u2019\n\u2018Then let us avenge it, ere we speak of it!\u2019 said Aragorn, and they\nrode back to battle together.\nHard fighting and long labour they had still; for the Southrons\nwere bold men and grim, and fierce in despair; and the Easterlings\nwere strong and war-hardened and asked for no quarter. And so in\nthis place and that, by burned homestead or barn, upon hillock or\nmound, under wall or on field, still they gathered and rallied and\nfought until the day wore away.\nThen the Sun went at last behind Mindolluin and filled all the\nsky with a great burning, so that the hills and the mountains were\ndyed as with blood; fire glowed in the River, and the grass of the\nPelennor lay red in the nightfall. And in that hour the great Battle\nof the field of Gondor was over; and not one living foe was left within\nthe circuit of the Rammas.

The Rohirrim are fighting on the fields of Gondor!\nWe must gather all the strength that we can find.\u2019\n\u2018You will need every man and more,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Make all\nhaste. I will come when I can. But I have an errand to the Lord\nDenethor that will not wait. Take command in the Lord\u2019s absence!\u2019\nThey passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the Citadel\nthey felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer\nof morning far away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it\nbrought little hope to them, not knowing what evil lay before them,\nfearing to come too late.\n\u2018Darkness is passing,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018but it still lies heavy on this\nCity.\u2019\nAt the gate of the Citadel they found no guard. \u2018Then Beregond\nhas gone,\u2019 said Pippin more hopefully. They turned away and\nhastened along the road to the Closed Door. It stood wide open, and\nthe porter lay before it. He was slain and his key had been taken.\n\u2018Work of the Enemy!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Such deeds he loves: friend\nat war with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.\u2019 Now he\ndismounted and bade Shadowfax return to his stable. \u2018For, my\nfriend,\u2019 he said, \u2018you and I should have ridden to the fields long ago,\nbut other matters delay me. Yet come swiftly if I call!\u2019\nThey passed the Door and walked on down the steep winding\nroad. Light was growing, and the tall columns and carven figures\nbeside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts.\nSuddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them cries\nand the ringing of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the\nhallowed places since the building of the City. At last they came to\nRath D\u00b4\u0131nen and hastened towards the House of the Stewards, loom-\ning in the twilight under its great dome.\n\u2018Stay! Stay!\u2019 cried Gandalf, springing forward to the stone stair\nbefore the door. \u2018Stay this madness!\u2019\nFor there were the servants of Denethor with swords and torches\nin their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood\nBeregond, clad in the black and silver of the Guard; and he held the\ndoor against them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword,\nstaining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him,"}

Or must I do so myself ?\u2019\nThereupon the door which Beregond held shut with his left hand\nwas wrenched open, and there behind him stood the Lord of the\nCity, tall and fell; a light like flame was in his eyes, and he held a\ndrawn sword.\nBut Gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him\nand covered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a\nwhite light into a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted\nup his hand, and in the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew up\nand left his grasp and fell behind him in the shadows of the house;\nand Denethor stepped backward before Gandalf as one amazed.\n\u2018What is this, my lord?\u2019 said the wizard. \u2018The houses of the dead\nare no places for the living. And why do men fight here in the Hallows\nwhen there is war enough before the Gate? Or has our Enemy come\neven to Rath D\u00b4\u0131nen?\u2019\n\u2018Since when has the Lord of Gondor been answerable to thee?\u2019\nsaid Denethor. \u2018Or may I not command my own servants?\u2019\n\u2018You may,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But others may contest your will, when\nit is turned to madness and evil. Where is your son, Faramir?\u2019\n\u2018He lies within,\u2019 said Denethor, \u2018burning, already burning. They\nhave set a fire in his flesh. But soon all shall be burned. The West\nhas failed. It shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended.\nAsh! Ash and smoke blown away on the wind!\u2019\nThen Gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he\nhad already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Bere-\ngond and Pippin behind him, while Denethor gave back until he\nstood beside the table within. But there they found Faramir, still\ndreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. Wood was piled under\nit, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the\ngarments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been\nset to the fuel. Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in\nhim, even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle.\nHe leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he\nsprang down again, and bore him towards the door. But as he did\nso Faramir moaned and called on his father in his dream.\nDenethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died\nin his eyes, and he wept; and he said: \u2018Do not take my son from me!\nHe calls for me.\u2019\n\u2018He calls,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018but you cannot come to him yet.

Denethor followed him, and\nstood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his son. And for\na moment, while all were silent and still, watching the Lord in his\nthroes, he wavered.\n\u2018Come!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We are needed. There is much that you\ncan yet do.\u2019\nThen suddenly Denethor laughed. He stood up tall and proud\nagain, and stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the\npillow on which his head had lain. Then coming to the doorway he\ndrew aside the covering, and lo! he had between his hands a palant\u00b4\u0131r.\nAnd as he held it up, it seemed to those that looked on that the globe\nbegan to glow with an inner flame, so that the lean face of the Lord\nwas lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut out of hard stone, sharp\nwith black shadows, noble, proud, and terrible. His eyes glittered.\n\u2018Pride and despair!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Didst thou think that the eyes of\nthe White Tower were blind? Nay, I have seen more than thou know-\nest, Grey Fool. For thy hope is but ignorance. Go then and labour\nin healing! Go forth and fight! Vanity. For a little space you may\ntriumph on the field, for a day. But against the Power that now arises\nthere is no victory. To this City only the first finger of its hand has\nyet been stretched. All the East is moving. And even now the wind\nof thy hope cheats thee and wafts up Anduin a fleet with black sails.\nThe West has failed. It is time for all to depart who would not be\nslaves.\u2019\n\u2018Such counsels will make the Enemy\u2019s victory certain indeed,\u2019 said\nGandalf.\n\u2018Hope on then!\u2019 laughed Denethor. \u2018Do I not know thee, Mithran-\ndir? Thy hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne,\nnorth, south, or west. I have read thy mind and its policies. Do I not\nknow that this halfling was commanded by thee to keep silence? That\nhe was brought hither to be a spy within my very chamber? And yet\nin our speech together I have learned the names and purpose of all\nthy companions. So!

But if doom\ndenies this to me, then I will have naught: neither life diminished,\nnor love halved, nor honour abated.\u2019\n\u2018To me it would not seem that a Steward who faithfully surrenders\nhis charge is diminished in love or in honour,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018And at\nthe least you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is\nstill in doubt.\u2019\nAt those words Denethor\u2019s eyes flamed again, and taking the Stone\nunder his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. But\nBeregond sprang forward and set himself before Faramir.\n\u2018So!\u2019 cried Denethor. \u2018Thou hadst already stolen half my son\u2019s\nlove. Now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also, so that they\nrob me wholly of my son at the last. But in this at least thou shalt\nnot defy my will: to rule my own end.\u2019\n\u2018Come hither!\u2019 he cried to his servants. \u2018Come, if you are not all\nrecreant!\u2019 Then two of them ran up the steps to him. Swiftly he\nsnatched a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the\nhouse. Before Gandalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid\nthe fuel, and at once it crackled and roared into flame.\nThen Denethor leaped upon the table, and standing there\nwreathed in fire and smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship\nthat lay at his feet and broke it on his knee. Casting the pieces into\nthe blaze he bowed and laid himself on the table, clasping the palant\u00b4\u0131r\nwith both hands upon his breast. And it was said that ever after, if\nany man looked in that Stone, unless he had a great strength of will\nto turn it to other purpose, he saw only two aged hands withering in\nflame.\nGandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the\ndoor. For a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold,\nwhile those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within. And\nthen Denethor gave a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor\nwas ever again seen by mortal men."}
{"879": "\u2018And so pass also the days of Gondor that you have known; for good\nor evil they are ended.

You have been caught in a net of\nwarring duties that you did not weave. But think, you servants of the\nLord, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason of Beregond\nFaramir, Captain of the White Tower, would now also be burned.\n\u2018Bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have\nfallen. And we will bear Faramir, Steward of Gondor, to a place\nwhere he can sleep in peace, or die if that be his doom.\u2019\nThen Gandalf and Beregond taking up the bier bore it away\ntowards the Houses of Healing, while behind them walked Pippin\nwith downcast head. But the servants of the Lord stood gazing as\nstricken men at the house of the dead; and even as Gandalf came to\nthe end of Rath D\u00b4\u0131nen there was a great noise. Looking back they\nsaw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then\nwith a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; but still\nunabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. Then in\nterror the servants fled and followed Gandalf.\nAt length they came back to the Steward\u2019s Door, and Beregond\nlooked with grief at the porter. \u2018This deed I shall ever rue,\u2019 he said;\n\u2018but a madness of haste was on me, and he would not listen, but\ndrew sword against me.\u2019 Then taking the key that he had wrested\nfrom the slain man he closed the door and locked it. \u2018This should\nnow be given to the Lord Faramir,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018The Prince of Dol Amroth is in command in the absence of the\nLord,\u2019 said Gandalf; \u2018but since he is not here, I must take this on\nmyself.

They stood not far from the Citadel-\ngate, in the sixth circle, nigh to its southward wall, and about them\nwas a garden and a greensward with trees, the only such place in the\nCity. There dwelt the few women that had been permitted to remain\nin Minas Tirith, since they were skilled in healing or in the service\nof the healers.\nBut even as Gandalf and his companions came carrying the bier\nto the main door of the Houses, they heard a great cry that went up"}
{"880": "for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly\ntheir hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known\nsince the darkness came out of the East; and it seemed to them that\nthe light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds.\nBut Gandalf \u2019s face was grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and\nPippin to take Faramir into the Houses of Healing, he went up on\nto the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood\nin the new sun and looked out. And he beheld with the sight that\nwas given to him all that had befallen; and when E\u00b4 omer rode out\nfrom the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon\nthe field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went\nfrom the walls. And Beregond and Pippin found him standing in\nthought before the door of the Houses when they came out.\nThey looked at him, and for a while he was silent. At last he spoke.\n\u2018My friends,\u2019 he said, \u2018and all you people of this city and of the\nWestern lands! Things of great sorrow and renown have come to\npass. Shall we weep or be glad? Beyond hope the Captain of our foes\nhas been destroyed, and you have heard the echo of his last despair.\nBut he has not gone without woe and bitter loss. And that I might\nhave averted but for the madness of Denethor. So long has the reach\nof our Enemy become! Alas! but now I perceive how his will was\nable to enter into the very heart of the City.\n\u2018Though the Stewards deemed that it was a secret kept only by\nthemselves, long ago I guessed that here in the White Tower, one at\nleast of the Seven Seeing Stones was preserved. In the days of his\nwisdom Denethor would not presume to use it to challenge Sauron,\nknowing the limits of his own strength. But his wisdom failed; and\nI fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the Stone and\nwas deceived: far too often, I guess, since Boromir departed. He was\ntoo great to be subdued to the will of the Dark Power, he saw nonethe-\nless only those things which that Power permitted him to see. The\nknowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service to him;\nyet the vision of the great might of Mordor that was shown to him\nfed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.\u2019\n\u2018Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!\u2019 said Pippin,\nshuddering at his memories as he spoke. \u2018The Lord went away from\nthe room where Faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that\nI first thought he was changed, old and broken.\u2019\n\u2018It was in the very hour that Faramir was brought to the Tower\nthat many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,\u2019 said\nBeregond. \u2018But we have seen that light before, and it has long been"}
{"881": "\u2018Alas! then I have guessed rightly,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Thus the will of\nSauron entered into Minas Tirith; and thus I have been delayed here.\nAnd here I shall still be forced to remain, for I shall soon have other\ncharges, not Faramir only.\n\u2018Now I must go down to meet those who come. I have seen a\nsight upon the field that is very grievous to my heart, and greater\nsorrow may yet come to pass. Come with me, Pippin! But you,\nBeregond, should return to the Citadel and tell the chief of the Guard\nthere what has befallen. It will be his duty, I fear, to withdraw you\nfrom the Guard; but say to him that, if I may give him counsel, you\nshould be sent to the Houses of Healing, to be the guard and servant\nof your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes \u2013 if that shall\never be again. For by you he was saved from the fire. Go now! I shall\nreturn soon.\u2019\nWith that he turned away and went with Pippin down towards the\nlower city. And even as they hastened on their way the wind brought\na grey rain, and all the fires sank, and there arose a great smoke\nbefore them."}
{"882": "Chapter 8\nTHE HOUSES OF HEALING\nA mist was in Merry\u2019s eyes of tears and weariness when they drew\nnear the ruined Gate of Minas Tirith. He gave little heed to the\nwreck and slaughter that lay about all. Fire and smoke and stench\nwas in the air; for many engines had been burned or cast into the\nfire-pits, and many of the slain also, while here and there lay many\ncarcases of the great Southron monsters, half-burned, or broken by\nstone-cast, or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of Mor-\nthond. The flying rain had ceased for a time, and the sun gleamed\nup above; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a smouldering\nreek.\nAlready men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of\nbattle; and now out from the Gate came some bearing litters. Gently\nthey laid E\u00b4 owyn upon soft pillows; but the king\u2019s body they covered\nwith a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their\nflames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind.\nSo The\u00b4oden and E\u00b4owyn came to the City of Gondor, and all who\nsaw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the\nash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the\nstreets of stone. To Merry the ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless\njourney in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending\nthat memory cannot seize.\nSlowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went\nout, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: \u2018This is a\ntunnel leading to a tomb; there we shall stay for ever.\u2019 But suddenly\ninto his dream there fell a living voice.\n\u2018Well, Merry! Thank goodness I have found you!\u2019\nHe looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. There\nwas Pippin! They were face to face in a narrow lane, and but for\nthemselves it was empty. He rubbed his eyes.\n\u2018Where is the king?\u2019 he said. \u2018And E\u00b4owyn?\u2019 Then he stumbled and\nsat down on a doorstep and began to weep again.\n\u2018They have gone up into the Citadel,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I think you\nmust have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning.\nWhen we found that you were not with them, Gandalf sent me to\nlook for you. Poor old Merry! How glad I am to see you again! But\nyou are worn out, and I won\u2019t bother you with any talk. But tell me,"}
{"883": "right arm, Pippin, not since I stabbed him. And my sword burned\nall away like a piece of wood.\u2019\nPippin\u2019s face was anxious. \u2018Well, you had better come with me as\nquick as you can,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wish I could carry you. You aren\u2019t fit\nto walk any further. They shouldn\u2019t have let you walk at all; but you\nmust forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the\nCity, Merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily\noverlooked.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not always a misfortune being overlooked,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I was\noverlooked just now by \u2013 no, no, I can\u2019t speak of it.

Foot by foot.\nIt\u2019s not far.\u2019\n\u2018Are you going to bury me?\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018No, indeed!\u2019 said Pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his\nheart was wrung with fear and pity. \u2018No, we are going to the Houses\nof Healing.\u2019\nThey turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the\nouter wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street\nclimbing up to the Citadel. Step by step they went, while Merry\nswayed and murmured as one in sleep.\n\u2018I\u2019ll never get him there,\u2019 thought Pippin. \u2018Is there no one to help\nme? I can\u2019t leave him here.\u2019 Just then to his surprise a boy came\nrunning up behind, and as he passed he recognized Bergil Beregond\u2019s\nson.\n\u2018Hullo, Bergil!\u2019 he called. \u2018Where are you going? Glad to see you\nagain, and still alive!\u2019\n\u2018I am running errands for the Healers,\u2019 said Bergil. \u2018I cannot stay.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018But tell them up there that I have a sick\nhobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. I don\u2019t think\nhe can walk so far. If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the\nmessage.\u2019 Bergil ran on.\n\u2018I\u2019d better wait here,\u2019 thought Pippin. So he let Merry sink gently\ndown on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat\ndown beside him, laying Merry\u2019s head in his lap. He felt his body\nand limbs gently, and took his friend\u2019s hands in his own. The right\nhand felt icy to the touch.\nIt was not long before Gandalf himself came in search of them.\nHe stooped over Merry and caressed his brow; then he lifted him\ncarefully. \u2018He should have been borne in honour into this city,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018He has well repaid my trust; for if Elrond had not yielded to"}

For though\nall lore was in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old, the\nleechcraft of Gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of\nwound and hurt, and all such sickness as east of the Sea mortal men\nwere subject to. Save old age only. For that they had found no cure;\nand indeed the span of their lives had now waned to little more than\nthat of other men, and those among them who passed the tale of five\nscore years with vigour were grown few, save in some houses of purer\nblood. But now their art and knowledge were baffled; for there were\nmany sick of a malady that would not be healed; and they called it\nthe Black Shadow, for it came from the Nazgu\u02c6l. And those who were\nstricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream, and then passed\nto silence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to the\ntenders of the sick that on the Halfling and on the Lady of Rohan\nthis malady lay heavily. Still at whiles as the morning wore away they\nwould speak, murmuring in their dreams; and the watchers listened\nto all that they said, hoping perhaps to learn something that would\nhelp them to understand their hurts. But soon they began to fall\ndown into the darkness, and as the sun turned west a grey shadow\ncrept over their faces. But Faramir burned with a fever that would\nnot abate.\nGandalf went from one to the other full of care, and he was told\nall that the watchers could hear. And so the day passed, while the\ngreat battle outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings;\nand still Gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth; till at last\nthe red sunset filled all the sky, and the light through the windows\nfell on the grey faces of the sick. Then it seemed to those who stood\nby that in the glow the faces flushed softly as with health returning,\nbut it was only a mockery of hope.\nThen an old wife, Ioreth, the eldest of the women who served in\nthat house, looking on the fair face of Faramir, wept, for all the\npeople loved him. And she said: \u2018Alas! if he should die. Would that\nthere were kings in Gondor, as there were once upon a time, they\nsay! For it is said in old lore: The hands of the king are the hands of a\nhealer. And so the rightful king could ever be known.\u2019\nAnd Gandalf, who stood by, said: \u2018Men may long remember your\nwords, Ioreth! For there is hope in them. Maybe a king has indeed\nreturned to Gondor; or have you not heard the strange tidings that"}
{"885": "shouting,\u2019 she answered. \u2018All I hope is that those murdering devils\ndo not come to this House and trouble the sick.\u2019\nThen Gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky\nwas burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-\ngrey evening crept over the fields.\nNow as the sun went down Aragorn and E\u00b4omer and Imrahil drew\nnear the City with their captains and knights; and when they came\nbefore the Gate Aragorn said:\n\u2018Behold the Sun setting in a great fire! It is a sign of the end and\nfall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. But this\nCity and realm has rested in the charge of the Stewards for many\nlong years, and I fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and\ndebate may arise, which should not be while this war is fought. I will\nnot enter in, nor make any claim, until it be seen whether we or\nMordor shall prevail. Men shall pitch my tents upon the field, and\nhere I will await the welcome of the Lord of the City.\u2019\nBut E\u00b4 omer said: \u2018Already you have raised the banner of the Kings\nand displayed the tokens of Elendil\u2019s House. Will you suffer these to\nbe challenged?\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But I deem the time unripe; and I have no\nmind for strife except with our Enemy and his servants.\u2019\nAnd the Prince Imrahil said: \u2018Your words, lord, are wise, if one\nwho is a kinsman of the Lord Denethor may counsel you in this\nmatter. He is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has\nbeen strange since his son was stricken down. Yet I would not have\nyou remain like a beggar at the door.\u2019\n\u2018Not a beggar,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018Say a captain of the Rangers, who\nare unused to cities and houses of stone.\u2019 And he commanded that\nhis banner should be furled; and he did off the Star of the North\nKingdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of Elrond.\nThen the Prince Imrahil and E\u00b4omer of Rohan left him and passed\nthrough the City and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the\nCitadel; and they came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward.\nBut they found his chair empty, and before the dais lay The\u00b4oden\nKing of the Mark upon a bed of state; and twelve torches stood about\nit, and twelve guards, knights both of Rohan and Gondor. And the\nhangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was\nlaid the great cloth of gold up to his breast, and upon that his\nunsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield.

And where also is Mithrandir?\u2019\nAnd one of the guards answered: \u2018The Steward of Gondor is in\nthe Houses of Healing.\u2019\nBut E\u00b4omer said: \u2018Where is the Lady E\u00b4owyn, my sister; for surely\nshe should be lying beside the king, and in no less honour? Where\nhave they bestowed her?\u2019\nAnd Imrahil said: \u2018But the Lady E\u00b4owyn was yet living when they\nbore her hither. Did you not know?\u2019\nThen hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to E\u00b4 omer\u2019s heart, and\nwith it the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but\nturned and went swiftly from the hall; and the Prince followed him.\nAnd when they came forth evening had fallen and many stars were\nin the sky. And there came Gandalf on foot and with him one cloaked\nin grey; and they met before the doors of the Houses of Healing.\nAnd they greeted Gandalf and said: \u2018We seek the Steward, and men\nsay that he is in this House. Has any hurt befallen him? And the\nLady E\u00b4 owyn, where is she?\u2019\nAnd Gandalf answered: \u2018She lies within and is not dead, but is\nnear death. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as\nyou have heard, and he is now the Steward; for Denethor has\ndeparted, and his house is in ashes.\u2019 And they were filled with grief\nand wonder at the tale that he told.\nBut Imrahil said: \u2018So victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter\nbought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their\nlords. E\u00b4omer rules the Rohirrim. Who shall rule the City meanwhile?\nShall we not send now for the Lord Aragorn?\u2019\nAnd the cloaked man spoke and said: \u2018He is come.\u2019 And they saw\nas he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was\nAragorn, wrapped in the grey cloak of Lo\u00b4 rien above his mail, and\nbearing no other token than the green stone of Galadriel. \u2018I have\ncome because Gandalf begs me to do so,\u2019 he said. \u2018But for the present\nI am but the Captain of the Du\u00b4nedain of Arnor; and the Lord of\nDol Amroth shall rule the City until Faramir awakes. But it is my\ncounsel that Gandalf should rule us all in the days that follow and\nin our dealings with the Enemy.\u2019 And they agreed upon that.\nThen Gandalf said: \u2018Let us not stay at the door, for the time is\nurgent. Let us enter! For it is only in the coming of Aragorn that any\nhope remains for the sick that lie in the House. Thus spake Ioreth,\nwise-woman of Gondor: The hands of the king are the hands of a healer,\nand so shall the rightful king be known.\u2019"}

How did you do it?\u2019\nAragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. \u2018Well met\nindeed!\u2019 he said. \u2018But there is not time yet for travellers\u2019 tales.\u2019\nBut Imrahil said to E\u00b4omer: \u2018Is it thus that we speak to our kings?\nYet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!\u2019\nAnd Aragorn hearing him, turned and said: \u2018Verily, for in the high\ntongue of old I am Elessar, the Elfstone, and Envinyatar, the\nRenewer\u2019: and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there.\n\u2018But Strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established.\nIn the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and Telcontar I will be and\nall the heirs of my body.\u2019\nAnd with that they passed into the House; and as they went\ntowards the rooms where the sick were tended Gandalf told of the\ndeeds of E\u00b4 owyn and Meriadoc. \u2018For,\u2019 he said, \u2018long have I stood by\nthem, and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they\nsank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many\nthings far off.\u2019\nAragorn went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady E\u00b4 owyn, and\nlast to Merry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen\ntheir hurts he sighed. \u2018Here I must put forth all such power and skill\nas is given to me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Would that Elrond were here, for he is\nthe eldest of all our race, and has the greater power.\u2019\nAnd E\u00b4omer seeing that he was both sorrowful and weary said:\n\u2018First you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?\u2019\nBut Aragorn answered: \u2018Nay, for these three, and most soon for\nFaramir, time is running out. All speed is needed.\u2019\nThen he called to Ioreth and he said: \u2018You have store in this House\nof the herbs of healing?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, lord,\u2019 she answered; \u2018but not enough, I reckon, for all that\nwill need them. But I am sure I do not know where we shall find\nmore; for all things are amiss in these dreadful days, what with fires\nand burnings, and the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads\nblocked. Why, it is days out of count since ever a carrier came in\nfrom Lossarnach to the market! But we do our best in this House\nwith what we have, as I am sure your lordship will know.\u2019\n\u2018I will judge that when I see,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018One thing also is\nshort, time for speech.

No, we have none of it, I am sure.

If sweet is the right\nword: wholesome, maybe, is nearer.\u2019\n\u2018Wholesome verily,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018And now, dame, if you love\nthe Lord Faramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil,\nif there is a leaf in the City.\u2019\n\u2018And if not,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018I will ride to Lossarnach with Ioreth\nbehind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters.\nAnd Shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.\u2019\nWhen Ioreth was gone, Aragorn bade the other women to make\nwater hot. Then he took Faramir\u2019s hand in his, and laid the other hand\nupon the sick man\u2019s brow. It was drenched with sweat; but Faramir\ndid not move or make any sign, and seemed hardly to breathe.\n\u2018He is nearly spent,\u2019 said Aragorn turning to Gandalf. \u2018But this\ncomes not from the wound. See! that is healing. Had he been smitten\nby some dart of the Nazgu\u02c6 l, as you thought, he would have died that\nnight. This hurt was given by some Southron arrow, I would guess.\nWho drew it forth? Was it kept?\u2019\n\u2018I drew it forth,\u2019 said Imrahil, \u2018and staunched the wound. But I\ndid not keep the arrow, for we had much to do. It was, as I remember,\njust such a dart as the Southrons use. Yet I believed that it came\nfrom the Shadows above, for else his fever and sickness were not to\nbe understood; since the wound was not deep or vital. How then do\nyou read the matter?\u2019\n\u2018Weariness, grief for his father\u2019s mood, a wound, and over all the\nBlack Breath,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018He is a man of staunch will, for already\nhe had come close under the Shadow before ever he rode to battle\non the out-walls. Slowly the dark must have crept on him, even as\nhe fought and strove to hold his outpost. Would that I could have\nbeen here sooner!\u2019\nThereupon the herb-master entered. \u2018Your lordship asked for\nkingsfoil, as the rustics name it,\u2019 he said; \u2018or athelas in the noble\ntongue, or to those who know somewhat of the Valinorean...\u2019"}

But alas! sir, we do not keep this thing in\nthe Houses of Healing, where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended.\nFor it has no virtue that we know of, save perhaps to sweeten a fouled\nair, or to drive away some passing heaviness. Unless, of course, you\ngive heed to rhymes of old days which women such as our good\nIoreth still repeat without understanding.\nWhen the black breath blows\nand death\u2019s shadow grows\nand all lights pass,\ncome athelas! come athelas!\nLife to the dying\nIn the king\u2019s hand lying!\nIt is but a doggrel, I fear, garbled in the memory of old wives.

And those that watched felt that some great struggle was going\non. For Aragorn\u2019s face grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon\nhe called the name of Faramir, but each time more faintly to their\nhearing, as if Aragorn himself was removed from them, and walked\nafar in some dark vale, calling for one that was lost.\nAnd at last Bergil came running in, and he bore six leaves in a\ncloth. \u2018It is kingsfoil, Sir,\u2019 he said; \u2018but not fresh, I fear. It must have\nbeen culled two weeks ago at the least. I hope it will serve, Sir?\u2019 Then\nlooking at Faramir he burst into tears.\nBut Aragorn smiled. \u2018It will serve,\u2019 he said. \u2018The worst is now\nover. Stay and be comforted!\u2019 Then taking two leaves, he laid them\non his hands and breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and\nstraightway a living freshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke\nand tingled, sparkling with joy. And then he cast the leaves into the\nbowls of steaming water that were brought to him, and at once all\nhearts were lightened. For the fragrance that came to each was like\na memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land of\nwhich the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory. But\nAragorn stood up as one refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he held a\nbowl before Faramir\u2019s dreaming face."}

I come. What does the king command?\u2019\n\u2018Walk no more in the shadows, but awake!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018You\nare weary. Rest a while, and take food, and be ready when I return.\u2019\n\u2018I will, lord,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018For who would lie idle when the king\nhas returned?\u2019\n\u2018Farewell then for a while!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018I must go to others who\nneed me.\u2019 And he left the chamber with Gandalf and Imrahil; but\nBeregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy.\nAs he followed Gandalf and shut the door Pippin heard Ioreth\nexclaim:\n\u2018King! Did you hear that? What did I say? The hands of a healer,\nI said.\u2019 And soon the word had gone out from the House that the\nking was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing;\nand the news ran through the City.\nBut Aragorn came to E\u00b4 owyn, and he said: \u2018Here there is a grievous\nhurt and a heavy blow. The arm that was broken has been tended\nwith due skill, and it will mend in time, if she has the strength to\nlive. It is the shield-arm that is maimed; but the chief evil comes\nthrough the sword-arm. In that there now seems no life, although it\nis unbroken.\n\u2018Alas! For she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her\nmind or body. And those who will take a weapon to such an enemy\nmust be sterner than steel, if the very shock shall not destroy them.\nIt was an evil doom that set her in his path. For she is a fair maiden,\nfairest lady of a house of queens. And yet I know not how I should\nspeak of her. When I first looked on her and perceived her unhappi-\nness, it seemed to me that I saw a white flower standing straight and\nproud, shapely as a lily, and yet knew that it was hard, as if wrought\nby elf-wrights out of steel. Or was it, maybe, a frost that had turned\nits sap to ice, and so it stood, bitter-sweet, still fair to see, but stricken,\nsoon to fall and die? Her malady begins far back before this day, does\nit not, E\u00b4 omer?\u2019\n\u2018I marvel that you should ask me, lord,\u2019 he answered. \u2018For I hold\nyou blameless in this matter, as in all else; yet I knew not that E\u00b4 owyn,\nmy sister, was touched by any frost, until she first looked on you.\nCare and dread she had, and shared with me, in the days of Worm-"}

Yet she was doomed to wait\nupon an old man, whom she loved as a father, and watch him falling\ninto a mean dishonoured dotage; and her part seemed to her more\nignoble than that of the staff he leaned on.\n\u2018Think you that Wormtongue had poison only for The\u00b4oden\u2019s ears?\nDotard! What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands\ndrink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs? Have\nyou not heard those words before? Saruman spoke them, the teacher\nof Wormtongue. Though I do not doubt that Wormtongue at home\nwrapped their meaning in terms more cunning. My lord, if your\nsister\u2019s love for you, and her will still bent to her duty, had not\nrestrained her lips, you might have heard even such things as these\nescape them. But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone,\nin the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking,\nand the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel\nsome wild thing in?\u2019\nThen E\u00b4 omer was silent, and looked on his sister, as if pondering\nanew all the days of their past life together.

Few other griefs amid the ill chances of this\nworld have more bitterness and shame for a man\u2019s heart than to behold\nthe love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned. Sorrow and\npity have followed me ever since I left her desperate in Dunharrow and\nrode to the Paths of the Dead; and no fear upon that way was so\npresent as the fear for what might befall her. And yet, E\u00b4omer, I say\nto you that she loves you more truly than me; for you she loves and\nknows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought: a hope of\nglory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of Rohan.\n\u2018I have, maybe, the power to heal her body, and to recall her from\nthe dark valley. But to what she will awake: hope, or forgetfulness,\nor despair, I do not know. And if to despair, then she will die, unless\nother healing comes which I cannot bring. Alas! for her deeds have\nset her among the queens of great renown.\u2019\nThen Aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed\nwhite as a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone.

And get my pipe out of my pack,\nif it isn\u2019t broken.\u2019\nAragorn and Gandalf went now to the Warden of the Houses of\nHealing, and they counselled him that Faramir and E\u00b4owyn should\nremain there and still be tended with care for many days.\n\u2018The Lady E\u00b4 owyn,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018will wish soon to rise and depart;\nbut she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way\nrestrain her, until at least ten days be passed.\u2019\n\u2018As for Faramir,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018he must soon learn that his father\nis dead.

And Aragorn arose and went out, and he\nsent for the sons of Elrond, and together they laboured far into the\nnight. And word went through the City: \u2018The King is come again\nindeed.\u2019 And they named him Elfstone, because of the green stone\nthat he wore, and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that\nhe should bear was chosen for him by his own people.\nAnd when he could labour no more, he cast his cloak about him,\nand slipped out of the City, and went to his tent just ere dawn and\nslept for a little. And in the morning the banner of Dol Amroth, a\nwhite ship like a swan upon blue water, floated from the Tower, and\nmen looked up and wondered if the coming of the King had been\nbut a dream."}
{"896": "Chapter 9\nTHE LAST DEBATE\nThe morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light\nclouds and the wind turning westward. Legolas and Gimli were early\nabroad, and they begged leave to go up into the City; for they were\neager to see Merry and Pippin.\n\u2018It is good to learn that they are still alive,\u2019 said Gimli; \u2018for they\ncost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have\nsuch pains all wasted.\u2019\nTogether the Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk\nthat saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was\nfair of face beyond the measure of Men, and he sang an elven-song in\na clear voice as he walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked beside\nhim, stroking his beard and staring about him.\n\u2018There is some good stone-work here,\u2019 he said as he looked at the\nwalls; \u2018but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better\ncontrived. When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the\nservice of stonewrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a\ntown to be proud of.\u2019\n\u2018They need more gardens,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018The houses are dead,\nand there is too little here that grows and is glad. If Aragorn comes\ninto his own, the people of the Wood shall bring him birds that sing\nand trees that do not die.\u2019\nAt length they came to the Prince Imrahil, and Legolas looked at\nhim and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had\nelven-blood in his veins. \u2018Hail, lord!\u2019 he said. \u2018It is long since the\npeople of Nimrodel left the woodlands of Lo\u00b4 rien, and yet still one\nmay see that not all sailed from Amroth\u2019s haven west over water.\u2019\n\u2018So it is said in the lore of my land,\u2019 said the Prince; \u2018yet never\nhas one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. And\nI marvel to see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. What\ndo you seek?\u2019\n\u2018I am one of the Nine Companions who set out with Mithrandir\nfrom Imladris,\u2019 said Legolas; \u2018and with this Dwarf, my friend, I came\nwith the Lord Aragorn. But now we wish to see our friends, Meriadoc\nand Peregrin, who are in your keeping, we are told.\u2019\n\u2018You will find them in the Houses of Healing, and I will lead you"}
{"897": "\u2018For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish to enter\nthe City again at this time. Yet there is need for the captains to hold\ncouncil at once, and he prays that you and E\u00b4 omer of Rohan will\ncome down to his tents, as soon as may be. Mithrandir is already\nthere.\u2019\n\u2018We will come,\u2019 said Imrahil; and they parted with courteous\nwords.\n\u2018That is a fair lord and a great captain of men,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018If\nGondor has such men still in these days of fading, great must have\nbeen its glory in the days of its rising.\u2019\n\u2018And doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought\nin the first building,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018It is ever so with the things that\nMen begin: there is a frost in Spring, or a blight in Summer, and\nthey fail of their promise.\u2019\n\u2018Yet seldom do they fail of their seed,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018And that\nwill lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places\nunlooked-for. The deeds of Men will outlast us, Gimli.\u2019\n\u2018And yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, I guess,\u2019\nsaid the Dwarf.\n\u2018To that the Elves know not the answer,\u2019 said Legolas.\nWith that the servant of the Prince came and led them to the\nHouses of Healing; and there they found their friends in the garden,\nand their meeting was a merry one. For a while they walked and\ntalked, rejoicing for a brief space in peace and rest under the morning\nhigh up in the windy circles of the City. Then when Merry became\nweary, they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the\nHouses of Healing behind them; and away southward before them\nwas the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of the\nsight even of Legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of Lebennin\nand South Ithilien.\nAnd now Legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked\nout against the sun, and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating\nup the River.\n\u2018Look!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Gulls! They are flying far inland. A wonder they\nare to me and a trouble to my heart. Never in all my life had I met\nthem, until we came to Pelargir, and there I heard them crying in\nthe air as we rode to the battle of the ships. Then I stood still,\nforgetting war in Middle-earth; for their wailing voices spoke to me\nof the Sea. The Sea! Alas! I have not yet beheld it. But deep in the\nhearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is perilous to\nstir. Alas! for the gulls. No peace shall I have again under beech or"}
{"898": "Middle-earth, and great works to do. But if all the fair folk take to\nthe Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to\nstay.\u2019\n\u2018Dull and dreary indeed!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018You must not go to the\nHavens, Legolas. There will always be some folk, big or little, and\neven a few wise dwarves like Gimli, who need you. At least I hope\nso. Though I feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come.\nHow I wish it was all over, and well over!\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t be so gloomy!\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018The Sun is shining, and here\nwe are together for a day or two at least. I want to hear more about\nyou all. Come, Gimli! You and Legolas have mentioned your strange\njourney with Strider about a dozen times already this morning. But\nyou haven\u2019t told me anything about it.\u2019\n\u2018The Sun may shine here,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018but there are memories of\nthat road that I do not wish to recall out of the darkness. Had I\nknown what was before me, I think that not for any friendship would\nI have taken the Paths of the Dead.\u2019\n\u2018The Paths of the Dead?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I heard Aragorn say that,\nand I wondered what he could mean. Won\u2019t you tell us some more?\u2019\n\u2018Not willingly,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018For upon that road I was put to shame:\nGimli Glo\u00b4in\u2019s son, who had deemed himself more tough than Men,\nand hardier under earth than any Elf. But neither did I prove; and I\nwas held to the road only by the will of Aragorn.\u2019\n\u2018And by the love of him also,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018For all those who\ncome to know him come to love him after their own fashion, even\nthe cold maiden of the Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere\nyou came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was\non all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady\nE\u00b4owyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There was grief at\nthat parting, and I was grieved to behold it.\u2019\n\u2018Alas! I had heart only for myself,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Nay! I will not\nspeak of that journey.\u2019\nHe fell silent; but Pippin and Merry were so eager for news that\nat last Legolas said: \u2018I will tell you enough for your peace; for I felt\nnot the horror, and I feared not the shadows of Men, powerless and\nfrail as I deemed them.\u2019\nSwiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains,\nand the dark tryst at Erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues\nand three, to Pelargir on Anduin. \u2018Four days and nights, and on into\na fifth, we rode from the Black Stone,\u2019 he said. \u2018And lo! in the darkness\nof Mordor my hope rose; for in that gloom the Shadow Host seemed\nto grow stronger and more terrible to look upon. Some I saw riding,"}
{"899": "they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would have passed\nus by, if Aragorn had not forbidden them.\n\u2018At his command they fell back. \u2018\u2018Even the shades of Men are\nobedient to his will,\u2019\u2019 I thought. \u2018\u2018They may serve his needs yet!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018One day of light we rode, and then came the day without dawn,\nand still we rode on, and Ciril and Ringlo\u00b4 we crossed; and on the\nthird day we came to Linhir above the mouth of Gilrain. And there\nmen of Lamedon contested the fords with fell folk of Umbar and\nHarad who had sailed up the river. But defenders and foes alike gave\nup the battle and fled when we came, crying out that the King of the\nDead was upon them. Only Angbor, Lord of Lamedon, had the heart\nto abide us; and Aragorn bade him gather his folk and come behind,\nif they dared, when the Grey Host had passed.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018At Pelargir the Heir of Isildur will have need of you,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Thus we crossed over Gilrain, driving the allies of Mordor in rout\nbefore us; and then we rested a while. But soon Aragorn arose, saying:\n\u2018\u2018Lo! already Minas Tirith is assailed. I fear that it will fall ere we\ncome to its aid.\u2019\u2019 So we mounted again before night had passed and\nwent on with all the speed that our horses could endure over the\nplains of Lebennin.\u2019\nLegolas paused and sighed, and turning his eyes southward softly\nhe sang:\nSilver flow the streams from Celos to Erui\nIn the green fields of Lebennin!\nTall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea\nThe white lilies sway,\nAnd the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin\nIn the green fields of Lebennin,\nIn the wind from the Sea!\n\u2018Green are those fields in the songs of my people; but they were\ndark then, grey wastes in the blackness before us. And over the wide\nland, trampling unheeded the grass and the flowers, we hunted our\nfoes through a day and a night, until we came at the bitter end to\nthe Great River at last.\n\u2018Then I thought in my heart that we drew near to the Sea; for\nwide was the water in the darkness, and sea-birds innumerable cried\non its shores. Alas for the wailing of the gulls! Did not the Lady tell\nme to beware of them? And now I cannot forget them.\u2019\n\u2018For my part I heeded them not,\u2019 said Gimli; \u2018for we came then\nat last upon battle in earnest. There at Pelargir lay the main fleet of"}
{"900": "their fear with them; and some of the ships had put off, seeking to\nescape down the River or to reach the far shore; and many of the\nsmaller craft were ablaze. But the Haradrim, being now driven to the\nbrink, turned at bay, and they were fierce in despair; and they laughed\nwhen they looked on us, for they were a great army still.\n\u2018But Aragorn halted and cried with a great voice: \u2018\u2018Now come! By\nthe Black Stone I call you!\u2019\u2019 And suddenly the Shadow Host that\nhad hung back at the last came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away\nbefore it. Faint cries I heard, and dim horns blowing, and a murmur\nas of countless far voices: it was like the echo of some forgotten battle\nin the Dark Years long ago. Pale swords were drawn; but I know not\nwhether their blades would still bite, for the Dead needed no longer\nany weapon but fear. None would withstand them.\n\u2018To every ship they came that was drawn up, and then they passed\nover the water to those that were anchored; and all the mariners were\nfilled with a madness of terror and leaped overboard, save the slaves\nchained to the oars. Reckless we rode among our fleeing foes, driving\nthem like leaves, until we came to the shore. And then to each of\nthe great ships that remained Aragorn sent one of the Du\u00b4nedain, and\nthey comforted the captives that were aboard, and bade them put\naside fear and be free.\n\u2018Ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us;\nall were drowned, or were flying south in the hope to find their own\nlands upon foot. Strange and wonderful I thought it that the designs\nof Mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness.\nWith its own weapons was it worsted!\u2019\n\u2018Strange indeed,\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018In that hour I looked on Aragorn\nand thought how great and terrible a Lord he might have become in\nthe strength of his will, had he taken the Ring to himself. Not for\nnaught does Mordor fear him. But nobler is his spirit than the under-\nstanding of Sauron; for is he not of the children of Lu\u00b4thien? Never\nshall that line fail, though the years may lengthen beyond count.\u2019\n\u2018Beyond the eyes of the Dwarves are such foretellings,\u2019 said Gimli.\n\u2018But mighty indeed was Aragorn that day. Lo! all the black fleet was\nin his hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he\nwent up into it. Then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets\ntaken from the enemy; and the Shadow Host withdrew to the shore.\nThere they stood silent, hardly to be seen, save for a red gleam in\ntheir eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were burning. And\nAragorn spoke in a loud voice to the Dead Men, crying:\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Hear now the words of the Heir of Isildur! Your oath is fulfilled.\nGo back and trouble not the valleys ever again! Depart and be at"}
{"901": "and broke his spear and cast it down. Then he bowed low and turned\naway; and swiftly the whole grey host drew off and vanished like a\nmist that is driven back by a sudden wind; and it seemed to me that\nI awoke from a dream.\n\u2018That night we rested while others laboured. For there were many\ncaptives set free, and many slaves released who had been folk of\nGondor taken in raids; and soon also there was a great gathering of\nmen out of Lebennin and the Ethir, and Angbor of Lamedon came\nup with all the horsemen that he could muster. Now that the fear of\nthe Dead was removed they came to aid us and to look on the Heir\nof Isildur; for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark.\n\u2018And that is near the end of our tale. For during that evening and\nnight many ships were made ready and manned; and in the morning\nthe fleet set forth. Long past it now seems, yet it was but the morn\nof the day ere yesterday, the sixth since we rode from Dunharrow.\nBut still Aragorn was driven by fear that time was too short.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018It is forty leagues and two from Pelargir to the landings at the\nHarlond,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Yet to the Harlond we must come tomorrow or\nfail utterly.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018The oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they\nlaboured; yet slowly we passed up the Great River, for we strove\nagainst its stream, and though that is not swift down in the South,\nwe had no help of wind. Heavy would my heart have been, for all\nour victory at the havens, if Legolas had not laughed suddenly.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Up with your beard, Durin\u2019s son!\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018For thus is it\nspoken: Oft hope is born, when all is forlorn.\u2019\u2019 But what hope he saw\nfrom afar he would not tell. When night came it did but deepen the\ndarkness, and our hearts were hot, for away in the North we saw\na red glow under the cloud, and Aragorn said: \u2018\u2018Minas Tirith is\nburning.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018But at midnight hope was indeed born anew. Sea-crafty men of\nthe Ethir gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh\nwind from the Sea. Long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail, and\nour speed grew, until dawn whitened the foam at our prows. And so\nit was, as you know, that we came in the third hour of the morning\nwith a fair wind and the Sun unveiled, and we unfurled the great\nstandard in battle. It was a great day and a great hour, whatever may\ncome after.\u2019\n\u2018Follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,\u2019 said\nLegolas. \u2018Great deed was the riding of the Paths of the Dead, and\ngreat it shall remain, though none be left in Gondor to sing of it in\nthe days that are to come.\u2019"}

Yet whatever is still to do, I hope\nto have a part in it, for the honour of the folk of the Lonely Mountain.\u2019\n\u2018And I for the folk of the Great Wood,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018and for the\nlove of the Lord of the White Tree.\u2019\nThen the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the\nhigh place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains\ndebated.\nWhen the Prince Imrahil had parted from Legolas and Gimli, at\nonce he sent for E\u00b4omer; and he went down with him from the City,\nand they came to the tents of Aragorn that were set up on the field\nnot far from the place where King The\u00b4oden had fallen. And there\nthey took counsel together with Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons\nof Elrond.\n\u2018My lords,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018listen to the words of the Steward of\nGondor before he died: You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor\nfor a day, but against the Power that has now arisen there is no victory.\nI do not bid you despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these\nwords.\n\u2018The Stones of Seeing do not lie, and not even the Lord of Barad-\ndu\u02c6r can make them do so. He can, maybe, by his will choose what\nthings shall be seen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the\nmeaning of what they see. Nonetheless it cannot be doubted that\nwhen Denethor saw great forces arrayed against him in Mordor, and\nmore still being gathered, he saw that which truly is.\n\u2018Hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault.\nThe next will be greater. This war then is without final hope, as\nDenethor perceived. Victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether\nyou sit here to endure siege after siege, or march out to be over-\nwhelmed beyond the River. You have only a choice of evils; and\nprudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you\nhave, and there await the onset; for so shall the time before your end\nbe made a little longer.\u2019\n\u2018Then you would have us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol Amroth,\nor to Dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when\nthe tide is flowing?\u2019 said Imrahil.\n\u2018That would be no new counsel,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Have you not\ndone this and little more in all the days of Denethor? But no! I said\nthis would be prudent. I do not counsel prudence. I said victory\ncould not be achieved by arms.

If he regains it,\nyour valour is vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so\ncomplete that none can foresee the end of it while this world lasts.\nIf it is destroyed, then he will fall; and his fall will be so low that\nnone can foresee his arising ever again. For he will lose the best part\nof the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that\nwas made or begun with that power will crumble, and he will be\nmaimed for ever, becoming a mere spirit of malice that gnaws itself\nin the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape.

Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of\nthe world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years\nwherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so\nthat those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather\nthey shall have is not ours to rule.\n\u2018Now Sauron knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing\nwhich he lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where\nit is, or so we hope. And therefore he is now in great doubt. For if\nwe have found this thing, there are some among us with strength\nenough to wield it. That too he knows. For do I not guess rightly,\nAragorn, that you have shown yourself to him in the Stone of\nOrthanc?\u2019\n\u2018I did so ere I rode from the Hornburg,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018I\ndeemed that the time was ripe, and that the Stone had come to me\nfor just such a purpose. It was then ten days since the Ring-bearer\nwent east from Rauros, and the Eye of Sauron, I thought, should be\ndrawn out from his own land. Too seldom has he been challenged\nsince he returned to his Tower. Though if I had foreseen how swift\nwould be his onset in answer, maybe I should not have dared to show\nmyself.

Also\nwe could not learn how to wield the full power all in a day. Indeed\nit can be used only by one master alone, not by many; and he will\nlook for a time of strife, ere one of the great among us makes himself\nmaster and puts down the others.

In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away\nto be destroyed, lest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force\ndefeat his force. But we must at all costs keep his Eye from his true\nperil. We cannot achieve victory by arms, but by arms we can give\nthe Ring-bearer his only chance, frail though it be.\n\u2018As Aragorn has begun, so we must go on. We must push Sauron\nto his last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he\nshall empty his land. We must march out to meet him at once. We\nmust make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us.\nHe will take that bait, in hope and in greed, for he will think that in\nsuch rashness he sees the pride of the new Ringlord: and he will say:\n\u2018\u2018So! he pushes out his neck too soon and too far.

For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves\nshall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that\neven if Barad-du\u02c6r be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new\nage.

For we must prepare against all chances,\ngood as well as evil. Now, it may be that we shall triumph, and while\nthere is any hope of this, Gondor must be protected. I would not\nhave us return with victory to a City in ruins and a land ravaged\nbehind us. And yet we learn from the Rohirrim that there is an army\nstill unfought upon our northern flank.\u2019\n\u2018That is true,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I do not counsel you to leave the\nCity all unmanned. Indeed the force that we lead east need not be\ngreat enough for any assault in earnest upon Mordor, so long as it be\ngreat enough to challenge battle. And it must move soon. Therefore I\nask the Captains: what force could we muster and lead out in two\ndays\u2019 time at the latest? And they must be hardy men that go willingly,\nknowing their peril.\u2019\n\u2018All are weary, and very many have wounds light or grievous,\u2019 said\nE\u00b4omer, \u2018and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is\nill to bear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot hope to lead even\ntwo thousands, and yet leave as many for the defence of the City.\u2019\n\u2018We have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field,\u2019\nsaid Aragorn. \u2018New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs,\nnow that the coasts have been rid. Four thousands I sent marching\nfrom Pelargir through Lossarnach two days ago; and Angbor the\nfearless rides before them. If we set out in two days more, they will\ndraw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many were bidden to follow me\nup the River in any craft they could gather; and with this wind they\nwill soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already come to the\nHarlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse\nand foot, and yet leave the City in better defence than it was when\nthe assault began.\u2019\n\u2018The Gate is destroyed,\u2019 said Imrahil, \u2018and where now is the skill\nto rebuild it and set it up anew?\u2019\n\u2018In Erebor in the Kingdom of Da\u00b4in there is such skill,\u2019 said Ara-\ngorn; \u2018and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send\nGimli Glo\u00b4 in\u2019s son to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are\nbetter than gates, and no gate will endure against our Enemy if men\ndesert it.\u2019\nThis then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should\nset forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands,\nif these might be found; and the great part of this force should be\non foot,because ofthe evillands into whichthey wouldgo. Aragorn"}
{"906": "and E\u00b4omer five hundreds of the Rohirrim who were unhorsed but\nthemselves warworthy, and he himself should lead five hundreds of\nhis best Riders on horse; and another company of five hundred horse\nthere should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond with\nthe Du\u00b4nedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand\nfoot and a thousand horse. But the main strength of the Rohirrim\nthat remained horsed and able to fight, some three thousand under\nthe command of Elfhelm, should waylay the West Road against the\nenemy that was in Ano\u00b4rien. And at once swift riders were sent out\nto gather what news they could northwards; and eastwards from\nOsgiliath and the road to Minas Morgul.\nAnd when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken\nthought for the journeys they should make and the roads they should\nchoose, Imrahil suddenly laughed aloud.\n\u2018Surely,\u2019 he cried, \u2018this is the greatest jest in all the history of\nGondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many\nas the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the\nmountains and the impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a\nchild threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green\nwillow! If the Dark Lord knows so much as you say, Mithrandir, will\nhe not rather smile than fear, and with his little finger crush us like\na fly that tries to sting him?\u2019\n\u2018No, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand\nmail-clad knights apiece. No, he will not smile.\u2019\n\u2018Neither shall we,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018If this be jest, then it is too bitter\nfor laughter. Nay, it is the last move in a great jeopardy, and for one\nside or the other it will bring the end of the game.\u2019 Then he drew\nAndu\u00b4ril and held it up glittering in the sun. \u2018You shall not be sheathed\nagain until the last battle is fought,\u2019 he said."}
{"907": "Chapter 10\nTHE BLACK GATE OPENS\nTwo days later the army of the West was all assembled on the\nPelennor. The host of Orcs and Easterlings had turned back out of\nAno\u00b4rien, but harried and scattered by the Rohirrim they had broken\nand fled with little fighting towards Cair Andros; and with that threat\ndestroyed and new strength arriving out of the South the City was\nas well manned as might be. Scouts reported that no enemies\nremained upon the roads east as far as the Cross-roads of the Fallen\nKing. All now was ready for the last throw.\nLegolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of\nAragorn and Gandalf, who went in the van with the Du\u00b4nedain and\nthe sons of Elrond. But Merry to his shame was not to go with them.\n\u2018You are not fit for such a journey,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But do not be\nashamed. If you do no more in this war, you have already earned\ngreat honour. Peregrin shall go and represent the Shire-folk; and do\nnot grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well\nas his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match your deed. But in\ntruth all now are in like danger. Though it may be our part to find\na bitter end before the Gate of Mordor, if we do so, then you will\ncome also to a last stand, either here or wherever the black tide\novertakes you. Farewell!\u2019\nAnd so despondently Merry now stood and watched the mustering\nof the army. Bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his\nfather was to march leading a company of the Men of the City: he\ncould not rejoin the Guard until his case was judged. In that same\ncompany Pippin was also to go, as a soldier of Gondor. Merry could\nsee him not far off, a small but upright figure among the tall men of\nMinas Tirith.\nAt last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. Troop by\ntroop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off east-\nward. And long after they had passed away out of sight down the\ngreat road to the Causeway, Merry stood there. The last glint of the\nmorning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he\nremained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling friendless and\nalone. Everyone that he cared for had gone away into the gloom that\nhungoverthedistanteasternsky;andlittlehopeatallwasleftinhis"}
{"908": "and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was\nroused by the touch of Bergil\u2019s hand.\n\u2018Come, Master Perian!\u2019 said the lad. \u2018You are still in pain, I see.\nI will help you back to the Healers. But do not fear! They will come\nback. The Men of Minas Tirith will never be overcome. And now\nthey have the Lord Elfstone, and Beregond of the Guard too.\u2019\nEre noon the army came to Osgiliath. There all the workers and\ncraftsmen that could be spared were busy. Some were strengthening\nthe ferries and boat-bridges that the enemy had made and in part\ndestroyed when they fled; some gathered stores and booty; and others\non the eastern side across the River were throwing up hasty works\nof defence.\nThe vanguard passed on through the ruins of Old Gondor, and\nover the wide River, and on up the long straight road that in the high\ndays had been made to run from the fair Tower of the Sun to the\ntall Tower of the Moon, which now was Minas Morgul in its accursed\nvale. Five miles beyond Osgiliath they halted, ending their first day\u2019s\nmarch.\nBut the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the\nCross-roads and the great ring of trees, and all was silent. No sign\nof any enemy had they seen, no cry or call had been heard, no shaft\nhad sped from rock or thicket by the way, yet ever as they went\nforward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase. Tree and\nstone, blade and leaf were listening. The darkness had been dispelled,\nand far away westward sunset was on the Vale of Anduin, and the\nwhite peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air; but a shadow\nand a gloom brooded upon the Ephel Du\u00b4ath.\nThen Aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran\ninto the ring of trees, and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds\ncried aloud: \u2018The Lords of Gondor have returned and all this land\nthat is theirs they take back.\u2019 The hideous orc-head that was set upon\nthe carven figure was cast down and broken in pieces, and the old\nking\u2019s head was raised and set in its place once more, still crowned\nwith white and golden flowers; and men laboured to wash and pare\naway all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone.\nNow in their debate some had counselled that Minas Morgul\nshould first be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly\ndestroyed. \u2018And, maybe,\u2019 said Imrahil, \u2018the road that leads thence to\nthe pass above will prove an easier way of assault upon the Dark\nLord than his northern gate.\u2019\nBut against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil"}

So\nthe next day when the main host came up, they set a strong guard\nupon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor should send\na force over the Morgul Pass, or should bring more men up from\nthe South. For that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the\nways of Ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about\nthe meeting of the ways. But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the\nvanguard to the entrance of Morgul Vale and looked on the evil\ncity.\nIt was dark and lifeless; for the Orcs and lesser creatures of Mordor\nthat had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle, and the Nazgu\u02c6l\nwere abroad. Yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity.\nThen they broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome\nfields and departed.\nThe day after, being the third day since they set out from Minas\nTirith, the army began its northward march along the road. It was\nsome hundred miles by that way from the Cross-roads to the Moran-\nnon, and what might befall them before they came so far none knew.\nThey went openly but heedfully, with mounted scouts before them\non the road, and others on foot upon either side, especially on the\neastward flank; for there lay dark thickets, and a tumbled land of\nrocky ghylls and crags, behind which the long grim slopes of the\nEphel Du\u00b4ath clambered up. The weather of the world remained fair,\nand the wind held in the west, but nothing could waft away the\nglooms and the sad mists that clung about the Mountains of Shadow;\nand behind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in\nthe upper winds.\nEver and anon Gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds\nwould cry: \u2018The Lords of Gondor are come! Let all leave this land\nor yield them up!\u2019 But Imrahil said: \u2018Say not The Lords of Gondor.\nSay The King Elessar. For that is true, even though he has not yet sat\nupon the throne; and it will give the Enemy more thought, if the\nheralds use that name.\u2019 And thereafter thrice a day the heralds pro-\nclaimed the coming of the King Elessar. But none answered the\nchallenge.\nNonetheless, though they marched in seeming peace, the hearts\nof all the army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and\nwith every mile that they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier\non them.

But the Captains of the\nWest were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from Henneth\nAnnu\u02c6n led by Mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. For\nhorsemen went wide about westward and came up on the flank of\nthe enemy and from behind, and they were destroyed or driven east\ninto the hills.\nBut the victory did little to enhearten the captains. \u2018It is but a\nfeint,\u2019 said Aragorn; \u2018and its chief purpose, I deem, was rather to\ndraw us on by a false guess of our Enemy\u2019s weakness than to do us\nmuch hurt, yet.\u2019 And from that evening onward the Nazgu\u02c6l came\nand followed every move of the army. They still flew high and out\nof sight of all save Legolas, and yet their presence could be felt, as a\ndeepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun; and though the\nRingwraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and were silent,\nuttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off.\nSo time and the hopeless journey wore away. Upon the fourth day\nfrom the Cross-roads and the sixth from Minas Tirith they came at\nlast to the end of the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation\nthat lay before the gates of the Pass of Cirith Gorgor; and they could\ndescry the marshes and the desert that stretched north and west to\nthe Emyn Muil. So desolate were those places and so deep the horror\nthat lay on them that some of the host were unmanned, and they\ncould neither walk nor ride further north.\nAragorn looked at them, and there was pity in his eyes rather than\nwrath; for these were young men from Rohan, from Westfold far\naway, or husbandmen from Lossarnach, and to them Mordor had\nbeen from childhood a name of evil, and yet unreal, a legend that\nhad no part in their simple life; and now they walked like men in a\nhideous dream made true, and they understood not this war nor why\nfate should lead them to such a pass.\n\u2018Go!\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But keep what honour you may, and do not\nrun! And there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly\nshamed. Take your way south-west till you come to Cair Andros,\nand if that is still held by enemies, as I think, then re-take it, if you\ncan; and hold it to the last in defence of Gondor and Rohan!\u2019\nThen some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and\nwent on, and the others took new hope, hearing of a manful deed\nwithin their measure that they could turn to, and they departed. And\nso, since many men had already been left at the Cross-roads, it was\nwith less than six thousands that the Captains of the West came at"}
{"911": "They advanced now slowly, expecting at every hour some answer\nto their challenge, and they drew together, since it was but waste of\nmen to send out scouts or small parties from the main host. At\nnightfall of the fifth day of the march from Morgul Vale they made\ntheir last camp, and set fires about it of such dead wood and heath\nas they could find. They passed the hours of night in wakefulness and\nthey were aware of many things half-seen that walked and prowled all\nabout them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The wind had\ndied and all the air seemed still. They could see little, for though it\nwas cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights old, there were\nsmokes and fumes that rose out of the earth and the white crescent\nwas shrouded in the mists of Mordor.\nIt grew cold. As morning came the wind began to stir again, but\nnow it came from the North, and soon it freshened to a rising breeze.\nAll the night-walkers were gone, and the land seemed empty. North\namid their noisome pits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of\nslag and broken rock and blasted earth, the vomit of the maggot-folk\nof Mordor; but south and now near loomed the great rampart of\nCirith Gorgor, and the Black Gate amidmost, and the two Towers\nof the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their last march\nthe Captains had turned away from the old road as it bent east, and\navoided the peril of the lurking hills, and so now they were approach-\ning the Morannon from the north-west, even as Frodo had done.\nThe two vast iron doors of the Black Gate under its frowning arch\nwere fast closed. Upon the battlement nothing could be seen. All\nwas silent but watchful. They were come to the last end of their folly,\nand stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of early day before towers\nand walls which their army could not assault with hope, not even if\nit had brought thither engines of great power, and the Enemy had\nno more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate and\nwall alone. Yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about the Moran-\nnon were filled with hidden foes, and the shadowy defile beyond was\nbored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things. And as they\nstood they saw all the Nazgu\u02c6l gathered together, hovering above the\nTowers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were\nwatched. But still the Enemy made no sign.\nNo choice was left them but to play their part to its end. Therefore\nAragorn now set the host in such array as could best be contrived;\nand they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth\nthat orcs had piled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor\nlay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools."}

There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with\nthe sons of Elrond, and E\u00b4 omer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas\nand Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies\nof Mordor should have a witness.\nThey came within cry of the Morannon, and unfurled the banner,\nand blew upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent\ntheir voices up over the battlement of Mordor.\n\u2018Come forth!\u2019 they cried. \u2018Let the Lord of the Black Land come\nforth! Justice shall be done upon him. For wrongfully he has made war\nupon Gondor and wrested its lands. Therefore the King of Gondor\ndemands that he should atone for his evils, and depart then for ever.\nCome forth!\u2019\nThere was a long silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound\nwas heard in answer. But Sauron had already laid his plans, and he\nhad a mind first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill.\nSo it was that, even as the Captains were about to turn away, the\nsilence was broken suddenly. There came a long rolling of great\ndrums like thunder in the mountains, and then a braying of horns\nthat shook the very stones and stunned men\u2019s ears. And thereupon\nthe door of the Black Gate was thrown open with a great clang, and\nout of it there came an embassy from the Dark Tower.\nAt its head there rode a tall and evil shape, mounted upon a black\nhorse, if horse it was; for it was huge and hideous, and its face was\na frightful mask, more like a skull than a living head, and in the\nsockets of its eyes and in its nostrils there burned a flame. The rider\nwas robed all in black, and black was his lofty helm; yet this was no\nRingwraith but a living man. The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-\ndu\u02c6r he was, and his name is remembered in no tale; for he himself\nhad forgotten it, and he said: \u2018I am the Mouth of Sauron.\u2019 But it is\ntold that he was a renegade, who came of the race of those that are\nnamed the Black Nu\u00b4meno\u00b4reans; for they established their dwellings\nin Middle-earth during the years of Sauron\u2019s domination, and they\nworshipped him, being enamoured of evil knowledge. And he entered\nthe service of the Dark Tower when it first rose again, and because\nof his cunning he grew ever higher in the Lord\u2019s favour; and he\nlearned great sorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron; and\nhe was more cruel than any orc.\nHe it was that now rode out, and with him came only a small\ncompany of black-harnessed soldiery, and a single banner, black but\nbearing on it in red the Evil Eye. Now halting a few paces before the\nCaptains of the West he looked them up and down and laughed.\n\u2018Is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?\u2019 he"}

But no one has threatened you.\nYou have naught to fear from us, until your errand is done. But\nunless your master has come to new wisdom, then with all his servants\nyou will be in great peril.\u2019\n\u2018So!\u2019 said the Messenger. \u2018Then thou art the spokesman, old grey-\nbeard? Have we not heard of thee at whiles, and of thy wanderings,\never hatching plots and mischief at a safe distance? But this time\nthou hast stuck out thy nose too far, Master Gandalf; and thou shalt\nsee what comes to him who sets his foolish webs before the feet of\nSauron the Great. I have tokens that I was bidden to show to thee\n\u2013 to thee in especial, if thou shouldst dare to come.\u2019 He signed to\none of his guards, and he came forward bearing a bundle swathed\nin black cloths.\nThe Messenger put these aside, and there to the wonder and\ndismay of all the Captains he held up first the short sword that Sam\nhad carried, and next a grey cloak with an elven-brooch, and last the\ncoat of mithril-mail that Frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered\ngarments. A blackness came before their eyes, and it seemed to them\nin a moment of silence that the world stood still, but their hearts\nwere dead and their last hope gone. Pippin who stood behind Prince\nImrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief.\n\u2018Silence!\u2019 said Gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the Mess-\nenger laughed aloud.\n\u2018So you have yet another of these imps with you!\u2019 he cried. \u2018What\nuse you find in them I cannot guess; but to send them as spies into\nMordor is beyond even your accustomed folly.

Or else his errand was one that you did not wish to fail? It has.\nAnd now he shall endure the slow torment of years, as long and slow\nas our arts in the Great Tower can contrive, and never be released,\nunless maybe when he is changed and broken, so that he may come\nto you, and you shall see what you have done. This shall surely be\nunless you accept my Lord\u2019s terms.\u2019\n\u2018Name the terms,\u2019 said Gandalf steadily, but those nearby saw the\nanguish in his face, and now he seemed an old and wizened man,\ncrushed, defeated at last. They did not doubt that he would accept.\n\u2018These are the terms,\u2019 said the Messenger, and smiled as he eyed\nthem one by one. \u2018The rabble of Gondor and its deluded allies shall\nwithdraw at once beyond the Anduin, first taking oaths never again\nto assail Sauron the Great in arms, open or secret. All lands east of\nthe Anduin shall be Sauron\u2019s for ever, solely. West of the Anduin as\nfar as the Misty Mountains and the Gap of Rohan shall be tributary\nto Mordor, and men there shall bear no weapons, but shall have\nleave to govern their own affairs. But they shall help to rebuild Isen-\ngard which they have wantonly destroyed, and that shall be Sauron\u2019s,\nand there his lieutenant shall dwell: not Saruman, but one more\nworthy of trust.\u2019\nLooking in the Messenger\u2019s eyes they read his thought. He was\nto be that lieutenant, and gather all that remained of the West under\nhis sway; he would be their tyrant and they his slaves.\nBut Gandalf said: \u2018This is much to demand for the delivery of one\nservant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must\nelse fight many a war to gain! Or has the field of Gondor destroyed\nhis hope in war, so that he falls to haggling? And if indeed we rated\nthis prisoner so high, what surety have we that Sauron, the Base\nMaster of Treachery, will keep his part? Where is this prisoner? Let\nhim be brought forth and yielded to us, and then we will consider\nthese demands.\u2019\nIt seemed then to Gandalf, intent, watching him as a man engaged\nin fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the\nMessenger was at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again.\n\u2018Do not bandy words in your insolence with the Mouth of Sauron!\u2019\nhe cried. \u2018Surety you crave!

Get you gone, for your embassy\nis over and death is near to you. We did not come here to waste\nwords in treating with Sauron, faithless and accursed; still less with\none of his slaves.

His face was\ntwisted with amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast\nthat, as it crouches on its prey, is smitten on the muzzle with a\nstinging rod. Rage filled him and his mouth slavered, and shapeless\nsounds of fury came strangling from his throat. But he looked at the\nfell faces of the Captains and their deadly eyes, and fear overcame\nhis wrath. He gave a great cry, and turned, leaped upon his steed,\nand with his company galloped madly back to Cirith Gorgor.

And out of the gathering mirk the Nazgu\u02c6l came with\ntheir cold voices crying words of death; and then all hope was\nquenched.\nPippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard Gandalf\nreject the terms and doom Frodo to the torment of the Tower; but\nhe had mastered himself, and now he stood beside Beregond in the\nfront rank of Gondor with Imrahil\u2019s men. For it seemed best to him\nto die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin.\n\u2018I wish Merry was here,\u2019 he heard himself saying, and quick\nthoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy\ncome charging to the assault. \u2018Well, well, now at any rate I understand\npoor Denethor a little better. We might die together, Merry and I,\nand since die we must, why not? Well, as he is not here, I hope he\u2019ll\nfind an easier end. But now I must do my best.\u2019\nHe drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes\nof red and gold; and the flowing characters of Nu\u00b4 menor glinted like\nfire upon the blade. \u2018This was made for just such an hour,\u2019 he thought.\n\u2018If only I could smite that foul Messenger with it, then almost I\nshould draw level with old Merry. Well, I\u2019ll smite some of this beastly\nbrood before the end. I wish I could see cool sunlight and green grass\nagain!\u2019\nThen even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into\nthem. The orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted\nand poured their arrows into the defending ranks. But through them\nthere came striding up, roaring like beasts, a great company of hill-\ntrolls out of Gorgoroth. Taller and broader than Men they were, and\nthey were clad only in close-fitting mesh of horny scales, or maybe\nthat was their hideous hide; but they bore round bucklers huge and\nblack and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands. Reckless\nthey sprang into the pools and waded across, bellowing as they came.\nLike a storm they broke upon the line of the men of Gondor, and\nbeat upon helm and head, and arm and shield, as smiths hewing\nthe hot bending iron. At Pippin\u2019s side Beregond was stunned and\noverborne, and he fell; and the great troll-chief that smote him down\nbent over him, reaching out a clutching claw; for these fell creatures\nwould bite the throats of those that they threw down.\nThen Pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of Wester-\nnesse pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the\ntroll, and his black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and\ncame crashing down like a falling rock, burying those beneath him."}
{"917": "\u2018So it ends as I guessed it would,\u2019 his thought said, even as it\nfluttered away; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost\ngay it seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear.\nAnd then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices,\nand they seemed to be crying in some forgotten world far above:\n\u2018The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!\u2019\nFor one moment more Pippin\u2019s thought hovered. \u2018Bilbo!\u2019 it said.\n\u2018But no! That came in his tale, long long ago.

{"921": "Chapter 1\nTHE TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL\nSam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a moment he\nwondered where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned\nto him. He was in the deep dark outside the under-gate of the orcs\u2019\nstronghold; its brazen doors were shut. He must have fallen stunned\nwhen he hurled himself against them; but how long he had lain there\nhe did not know. Then he had been on fire, desperate and furious;\nnow he was shivering and cold. He crept to the doors and pressed\nhis ears against them.\nFar within he could hear faintly the voices of orcs clamouring, but\nsoon they stopped or passed out of hearing, and all was still. His\nhead ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in the darkness, but he\nstruggled to steady himself and think. It was clear at any rate that he\nhad no hope of getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait\nthere for days before it was opened, and he could not wait: time was\ndesperately precious. He no longer had any doubt about his duty:\nhe must rescue his master or perish in the attempt.\n\u2018The perishing is more likely, and will be a lot easier anyway,\u2019 he\nsaid grimly to himself, as he sheathed Sting and turned from the\nbrazen doors. Slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the\ntunnel, not daring to use the elven-light; and as he went he tried to\nfit together the events since Frodo and he had left the Cross-roads.\nHe wondered what the time was. Somewhere between one day and\nthe next, he supposed; but even of the days he had quite lost count.\nHe was in a land of darkness where the days of the world seemed\nforgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten too.\n\u2018I wonder if they think of us at all,\u2019 he said, \u2018and what is happening\nto them all away there.\u2019 He waved his hand vaguely in the air before\nhim; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to\nShelob\u2019s tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing\nto noon upon the fourteenth day of March in the Shire-reckoning, and\neven now Aragorn was leading the black fleet from Pelargir, and Merry\nwas riding with the Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in\nMinas Tirith flames were rising and Pippin watched the madness grow-\ning in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all their cares and fear the\nthoughts of their friends turned constantly to Frodo and Sam. They\nwerenotforgotten.Buttheywerefarbeyondaid,andnothoughtcould"}
{"922": "He came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and\nstill unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled\nover as before and dropped softly to the ground. Then he made his\nway stealthily to the outlet of Shelob\u2019s tunnel, where the rags of her\ngreat web were still blowing and swaying in the cold airs. For cold\nthey seemed to Sam after the noisome darkness behind; but the\nbreath of them revived him. He crept cautiously out.\nAll was ominously quiet. The light was no more than that of dusk\nat a dark day\u2019s end. The vast vapours that arose in Mordor and went\nstreaming westward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and\nsmoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red.\nSam looked up towards the orc-tower, and suddenly from its nar-\nrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if\nthey were some signal. His fear of the orcs, forgotten for a while in\nhis wrath and desperation, now returned. As far as he could see,\nthere was only one possible course for him to take: he must go on\nand try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees\nfelt weak, and he found that he was trembling. Drawing his eyes\ndown from the tower and the horns of the Cleft before him, he forced\nhis unwilling feet to obey him, and slowly, listening with all his ears,\npeering into the dense shadows of the rocks beside the way, he\nretraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and still the stench\nof Shelob lingered, and then on and up, until he stood again in the very\ncleft where he had put on the Ring and seen Shagrat\u2019s company go by.\nThere he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive\nhimself no further. He felt that if once he went beyond the crown of\nthe pass and took one step veritably down into the land of Mordor,\nthat step would be irrevocable. He could never come back. Without\nany clear purpose he drew out the Ring and put it on again. Immedi-\nately he felt the great burden of its weight, and felt afresh, but now\nmore strong and urgent than ever, the malice of the Eye of Mordor,\nsearching, trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own\ndefence, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt.\nAs before, Sam found that his hearing was sharpened, but that to\nhis sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky\nwalls of the path were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a\ndistance he heard the bubbling of Shelob in her misery; and harsh\nand clear, and very close it seemed, he heard cries and the clash of\nmetal. He sprang to his feet, and pressed himself against the wall\nbeside the road. He was glad of the Ring, for here was yet another\ncompany of orcs on the march. Or so at first he thought. Then\nsuddenlyherealizedthatitwasnotso,hishearinghaddeceivedhim:"}
{"923": "Sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move. There was\nplainly some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty\nof the orcs had mastered them, and they were tormenting Frodo, or\neven savagely hacking him to pieces. He listened; and as he did so a\ngleam of hope came to him. There could not be much doubt: there\nwas fighting in the tower, the orcs must be at war among themselves,\nShagrat and Gorbag had come to blows. Faint as was the hope that\nhis guess brought him, it was enough to rouse him. There might be\njust a chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other thoughts, and\nforgetting his peril he cried aloud: \u2018I\u2019m coming, Mr. Frodo!\u2019\nHe ran forward to the climbing path, and over it. At once the road\nturned left and plunged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor.\nHe took off the Ring, moved it may be by some deep premonition\nof danger, though to himself he thought only that he wished to see\nmore clearly. \u2018Better have a look at the worst,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018No\ngood blundering about in a fog!\u2019\nHard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. Before\nhis feet the highest ridge of the Ephel Du\u00b4 ath fell steeply in great cliffs\ndown into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose\nanother ridge, much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags\nlike fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them: it\nwas the grim Morgai, the inner ring of the fences of the land. Far\nbeyond it, but almost straight ahead, across a wide lake of darkness\ndotted with tiny fires, there was a great burning glow; and from it\nrose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red at the roots, black\nabove where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all\nthe accursed land.\nSam was looking at Orodruin, the Mountain of Fire. Ever and\nanon the furnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with\na great surging and throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from\nchasms in its sides. Some would flow blazing towards Barad-du\u02c6r\ndown great channels; some would wind their way into the stony plain,\nuntil they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes vomited from\nthe tormented earth. In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mount\nDoom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of the Ephel\nDu\u00b4ath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now\nglared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched\nwith blood.\nIn that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his\nleft, he could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength.

About the lowest tier, two hundred feet\nbelow where Sam now stood, there was a battlemented wall enclosing\na narrow court. Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, opened\non a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a\nprecipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the\ndarkness to join the road that came over the Morgul Pass. Then on\nit went through a jagged rift in the Morgai out into the valley of\nGorgoroth and away to Barad-du\u02c6r. The narrow upper way on which\nSam stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path to meet the\nmain road under the frowning walls close to the Tower-gate.\nAs he gazed at it suddenly Sam understood, almost with a shock,\nthat this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of\nMordor, but to keep them in. It was indeed one of the works of\nGondor long ago, an eastern outpost of the defences of Ithilien, made\nwhen, after the Last Alliance, Men of Westernesse kept watch on the\nevil land of Sauron where his creatures still lurked. But as with Nar-\nchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so here too the vigilance\nhad failed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to the Lord of\nthe Ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil\nthings. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found it useful; for\nhe had few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose\nas of old was to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy\nwere so rash as to try to enter that land secretly, then it was also a\nlast unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance of\nMorgul and of Shelob.\nOnly too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to\ncreep down under those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate.\nAnd even if he did so, he could not go far on the guarded road\nbeyond: not even the black shadows, lying deep where the red glow\ncould not reach, would shield him long from the night-eyed orcs.\nBut desperate as that road might be, his task was now far worse: not\nto avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone.\nHis thought turned to the Ring, but there was no comfort there,\nonly dread and danger. No sooner had he come in sight of Mount\nDoom, burning far away, than he was aware of a change in his burden.\nAs it drew near the great furnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had\nbeen shaped and forged, the Ring\u2019s power grew, and it became more\nfell, untameable save by some mighty will.

He felt that he had from now on only two choices: to\nforbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and\nchallenge the Power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley\nof shadows. Already the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will\nand reason. Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise\nthe Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the\ndarkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the\noverthrow of Barad-du\u02c6r. And then all the clouds rolled away, and\nthe white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth\nbecame a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He\nhad only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this\ncould be.\nIn that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most\nto hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered\nhis plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was\nnot large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were\nnot a mere cheat to betray him. The one small garden of a free\ngardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm;\nhis own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.\n\u2018And anyway all these notions are only a trick,\u2019 he said to himself.\n\u2018He\u2019d spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shout out.\nHe\u2019d spot me, pretty quick, if I put the Ring on now, in Mordor.\nWell, all I can say is: things look as hopeless as a frost in Spring. Just\nwhen being invisible would be really useful, I can\u2019t use the Ring! And\nif ever I get any further, it\u2019s going to be nothing but a drag and a\nburden every step. So what\u2019s to be done?\u2019\nHe was not really in any doubt. He knew that he must go down\nto the gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders,\nas if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms, he began\nslowly to descend. With each step he seemed to diminish. He had\nnot gone far before he had shrunk again to a very small and frightened\nhobbit. He was now passing under the very walls of the Tower, and\nthe cries and sounds of fighting could be heard with his unaided ears.\nAt the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the court behind\nthe outer wall.\nSam was about half way down the path when out of the dark\ngateway into the red glow there came two orcs running. They did\nnot turn towards him. They were making for the main road; but even\nas they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still. Sam\nhad seen no arrows, but he guessed that the orcs had been shot down\nby others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate."}
{"926": "rose thirty feet, without a crack or ledge, to overhanging courses like\ninverted steps. The gate was the only way.\nHe crept on; and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived\nin the Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they\nwere quarrelling about, if that was what was happening. Shagrat\u2019s\ncompany had seemed to be about forty, and Gorbag\u2019s more than\ntwice as large; but of course Shagrat\u2019s patrol had only been a part\nof his garrison. Almost certainly they were quarrelling about Frodo,\nand the spoil. For a second Sam halted, for suddenly things seemed\nclear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his eyes. The\nmithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find\nit. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the\norders of the Dark Tower were at present Frodo\u2019s only protection,\nand if they were set aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any\nmoment.\n\u2018Come on, you miserable sluggard!\u2019 Sam cried to himself. \u2018Now\nfor it!\u2019 He drew Sting and ran towards the open gate. But just as he\nwas about to pass under its great arch he felt a shock: as if he had\nrun into some web like Shelob\u2019s, only invisible. He could see no\nobstacle, but something too strong for his will to overcome barred\nthe way. He looked about, and then within the shadow of the gate\nhe saw the Two Watchers.\nThey were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three\njoined bodies, and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across\nthe gateway. The heads had vulture-faces, and on their great knees\nwere laid clawlike hands. They seemed to be carved out of huge\nblocks of stone, immovable, and yet they were aware: some dreadful\nspirit of evil vigilance abode in them. They knew an enemy. Visible\nor invisible none could pass unheeded. They would forbid his entry,\nor his escape.\nHardening his will Sam thrust forward once again, and halted with\na jerk, staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head. Then\ngreatly daring, because he could think of nothing else to do, answering\na sudden thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of\nGaladriel and held it up. Its white light quickened swiftly, and the\nshadows under the dark arch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there\ncold and still, revealed in all their hideous shape. For a moment Sam\ncaught a glitter in the black stones of their eyes, the very malice of\nwhich made him quail; but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble\ninto fear.\nHe sprang past them; but even as he did so, thrusting the phial\nback into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had"}

Far up above, like an answering signal, a harsh\nbell clanged a single stroke.\n\u2018That\u2019s done it!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Now I\u2019ve rung the front-door bell!\nWell, come on somebody!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Tell Captain Shagrat that the\ngreat Elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!\u2019\nThere was no answer. Sam strode forward. Sting glittered blue in\nhis hand. The courtyard lay in deep shadow, but he could see that\nthe pavement was strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were two\norc-archers with knives sticking in their backs. Beyond lay many more\nshapes; some singly as they had been hewn down or shot; others in\npairs, still grappling one another, dead in the very throes of stabbing,\nthrottling, biting. The stones were slippery with dark blood.\nTwo liveries Sam noticed, one marked by the Red Eye, the other\nby a Moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death; but he did not\nstop to look more closely. Across the court a great door at the foot\nof the Tower stood half open, and a red light came through; a large\norc lay dead upon the threshold. Sam sprang over the body and went\nin; and then he peered about at a loss.\nA wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the\nmountain-side. It was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on\nthe walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and\nopenings could be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save\nfor two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor. From what he\nhad heard of the captains\u2019 talk Sam knew that, dead or alive, Frodo\nwould most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far\nabove; but he might search for a day before he found the way.\n\u2018It\u2019ll be near the back, I guess,\u2019 Sam muttered. \u2018The whole Tower\nclimbs backwards-like. And anyway I\u2019d better follow these lights.\u2019\nHe advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more\nreluctant. Terror was beginning to grip him again. There was no\nsound save the rap of his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing\nnoise, like the slapping of great hands upon the stones. The dead\nbodies; the emptiness; the dank black walls that in the torchlight\nseemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden death lurking in door-\nway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice\nat the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself to face.\nHe would have welcomed a fight \u2013 with not too many enemies at a\ntime \u2013 rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced him-\nself to think of Frodo, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in\nthis dreadful place. He went on.\nHe had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched"}

It dragged at\nthe chain and clutched the Ring. But Sam did not put it on; for even\nas he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping\nout of a dark opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more\nthan six paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and Sam\ncould hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes.\nIt stopped short aghast. For what it saw was not a small frightened\nhobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape,\ncloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wavering light behind;\nin one hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain,\nthe other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless\nmenace of power and doom.\nFor a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of\nfear it turned and fled back as it had come. Never was any dog more\nheartened when its enemy turned tail than Sam at this unexpected\nflight. With a shout he gave chase.\n\u2018Yes! The Elf-warrior is loose!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I\u2019m coming. Just you\nshow me the way up, or I\u2019ll skin you!\u2019\nBut the orc was in its own haunts, nimble and well-fed. Sam was\na stranger, hungry and weary. The stairs were high and steep and\nwinding. Sam\u2019s breath began to come in gasps. The orc had soon\npassed out of sight, and now only faintly could be heard the slapping\nof its feet as it went on and up. Every now and again it gave a yell,\nand the echo ran along the walls. But slowly all sound of it died\naway.\nSam plodded on. He felt that he was on the right road, and his\nspirits had risen a good deal. He thrust the Ring away and tightened\nhis belt. \u2018Well, well!\u2019 he said. \u2018If only they all take such a dislike to\nme and my Sting, this may turn out better than I hoped. And anyway\nit looks as if Shagrat, Gorbag, and company have done nearly all my\njob for me. Except for that little frightened rat, I do believe there\u2019s\nnobody left alive in the place!\u2019\nAnd with that he stopped, brought up hard, as if he had hit his\nhead against the stone wall. The full meaning of what he had said\nstruck him like a blow. Nobody left alive! Whose had been that\nhorrible dying shriek? \u2018Frodo, Frodo! Master!\u2019 he cried half sobbing.\n\u2018If they\u2019ve killed you, what shall I do? Well, I\u2019m coming at last, right\nto the top, to see what I must.\u2019"}
{"929": "the Tower. Sam tried to count the steps, but after two hundred he\nlost his reckoning. He was moving quietly now; for he thought that\nhe could hear the sound of voices talking, still some way above. More\nthan one rat remained alive it seemed.\nAll at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath,\nnor force his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still.\nThe voices were now loud and near. Sam peered about. He had\nclimbed right to the flat roof of the third and highest tier of the\nTower: an open space, about twenty yards across, with a low parapet.\nThere the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the midst\nof the roof, with low doors facing east and west. Eastward Sam\ncould see the plain of Mordor vast and dark below, and the burning\nmountain far away. A fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells,\nand the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of\nmany miles the light of them lit the tower-top with a red glare.\nWestward the view was blocked by the base of the great turret that\nstood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high above\nthe crest of the encircling hills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its\ndoor was not ten yards from where Sam stood. It was open but dark,\nand from just within its shadow the voices came.\nAt first Sam did not listen; he took a pace out of the eastward\ndoor and looked about. At once he saw that up here the fighting had\nbeen fiercest. All the court was choked with dead orcs, or their severed\nand scattered heads and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl\nfollowed by a blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. An\norc-voice rose in anger, and he knew it again at once, harsh, brutal,\ncold. It was Shagrat speaking, Captain of the Tower.\n\u2018You won\u2019t go again, you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot!\nIf you think I\u2019m so damaged that it\u2019s safe to flout me, you\u2019re mistaken.\nCome here, and I\u2019ll squeeze your eyes out, like I did to Radbug just\nnow. And when some new lads come, I\u2019ll deal with you: I\u2019ll send\nyou to Shelob.\u2019\n\u2018They won\u2019t come, not before you\u2019re dead anyway,\u2019 answered\nSnaga surlily. \u2018I\u2019ve told you twice that Gorbag\u2019s swine got to the gate\nfirst, and none of ours got out.

I\u2019ve fought for the Tower against those\nstinking Morgul-rats, but a nice mess you two precious captains have\nmade of things, fighting over the swag.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s enough from you,\u2019 snarled Shagrat. \u2018I had my orders. It\nwas Gorbag started it, trying to pinch that pretty shirt.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you put his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had\nmore sense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the\nmost dangerous of these spies was still loose, and you wouldn\u2019t listen.\nAnd you won\u2019t listen now. Gorbag was right, I tell you. There\u2019s a\ngreat fighter about, one of those bloody-handed Elves, or one of the\nfilthy tarks. * He\u2019s coming here, I tell you. You heard the bell. He\u2019s\ngot past the Watchers, and that\u2019s tark\u2019s work. He\u2019s on the stairs. And\nuntil he\u2019s off them, I\u2019m not going down. Not if you were a Nazgu\u02c6l,\nI wouldn\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018So that\u2019s it, is it?\u2019 yelled Shagrat. \u2018You\u2019ll do this, and you\u2019ll not\ndo that? And when he does come, you\u2019ll bolt and leave me? No, you\nwon\u2019t! I\u2019ll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.\u2019\nOut of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying. Behind him\ncame Shagrat, a large orc with long arms that, as he ran crouching,\nreached to the ground. But one arm hung limp and seemed to be\nbleeding; the other hugged a large black bundle. In the red glare\nSam, cowering behind the stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil\nface as it passed: it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared\nwith blood; slaver dripped from its protruding fangs; the mouth\nsnarled like an animal.\nAs far as Sam could see, Shagrat hunted Snaga round the roof,\nuntil ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted\nback into the turret and disappeared. Then Shagrat halted. Out of\nthe eastward door Sam could see him now by the parapet, panting,\nhis left claw clenching and unclenching feebly. He put the bundle\non the floor and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and\nspat on it. Going to the parapet he leaned over, looking down into\nthe outer court far below. Twice he shouted but no answer came.\nSuddenly, as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back\nto the roof-top, Sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling\nbodies was moving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched\nthe bundle. It staggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed\nspear with a short broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust.\nBut at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or"}
{"931": "hate. Quick as a snake Shagrat slipped aside, twisted round, and\ndrove his knife into his enemy\u2019s throat.\n\u2018Got you, Gorbag!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Not quite dead, eh? Well, I\u2019ll finish\nmy job now.\u2019 He sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and\ntrampled it in his fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it\nwith his knife. Satisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a\nhorrible gurgling yell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put\nit between his teeth, and catching up the bundle he came loping\ntowards the near door of the stairs.\nSam had no time to think. He might have slipped out of the other\ndoor, but hardly without being seen; and he could not have played\nhide-and-seek with this hideous orc for long. He did what was prob-\nably the best thing he could have done. He sprang out to meet Shagrat\nwith a shout. He was no longer holding the Ring, but it was there,\na hidden power, a cowing menace to the slaves of Mordor; and in\nhis hand was Sting, and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the\nglitter of cruel stars in the terrible elf-countries, the dream of which\nwas a cold fear to all his kind. And Shagrat could not both fight and\nkeep hold of his treasure. He stopped, growling, baring his fangs.\nThen once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and as Sam sprang at\nhim, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he thrust it\nhard into his enemy\u2019s face. Sam staggered, and before he could\nrecover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs.\nSam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought\nof Frodo returned to him, and he remembered that the other orc had\ngone back into the turret. Here was another dreadful choice, and he\nhad no time to ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get\nhelp and come back. But if Sam pursued him, the other orc might\ndo some horrible deed up there. And anyway Sam might miss Shagrat\nor be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran back up the stairs.\n\u2018Wrong again, I expect,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018But it\u2019s my job to go right up to\nthe top first, whatever happens afterwards.\u2019\nAway below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over\nthe court and through the gate, bearing his precious burden. If Sam\ncould have seen him and known the grief that his escape would bring,\nhe might have quailed. But now his mind was set on the last stage\nof his search. He came cautiously to the turret-door and stepped\ninside. It opened into darkness. But soon his staring eyes were aware\nof a dim light at his right hand. It came from an opening that led to\nanother stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go winding up the\nturret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was glimmering\nfrom somewhere up above."}
{"932": "one of the red eyes that he and Frodo had seen from down below\nby the tunnel\u2019s mouth. Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on\nto the second storey, dreading at any moment to be attacked and to\nfeel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind. He came next to\na window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage\nthrough the middle of the turret. The door was open, the passage dark\nsave for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside\nfiltering through the window-slit. But here the stair stopped and\nclimbed no further. Sam crept into the passage. On either side there\nwas a low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound\nat all.\n\u2018A dead end,\u2019 muttered Sam; \u2018and after all my climb! This can\u2019t\nbe the top of the tower. But what can I do now?\u2019\nHe ran back to the lower storey and tried the door. It would not\nmove. He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face.\nHe felt that even minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped;\nand he could do nothing. He cared no longer for Shagrat or Snaga\nor any other orc that was ever spawned. He longed only for his\nmaster, for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand.\nAt last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below\nthe level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It\nwas quiet, horribly quiet. The torch, that was already burning low\nwhen he arrived, sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness\ncover him like a tide. And then softly, to his own surprise, there at\nthe vain end of his long journey and his grief, moved by what thought\nin his heart he could not tell, Sam began to sing.\nHis voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower:\nthe voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could\npossibly mistake for the clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured\nold childish tunes out of the Shire, and snatches of Mr. Bilbo\u2019s rhymes\nthat came into his mind like fleeting glimpses of the country of his\nhome. And then suddenly new strength rose in him, and his voice\nrang out, while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple\ntune.\nIn western lands beneath the Sun\nthe flowers may rise in Spring,\nthe trees may bud, the waters run,\nthe merry finches sing.\nOr there maybe \u2019tis cloudless night\nand swaying beeches bear\nthe Elven-stars as jewels white"}
{"933": "Though here at journey\u2019s end I lie\nin darkness buried deep,\nbeyond all towers strong and high,\nbeyond all mountains steep,\nabove all shadows rides the Sun\nand Stars for ever dwell:\nI will not say the Day is done,\nnor bid the Stars farewell.\n\u2018Beyond all towers strong and high,\u2019 he began again, and then he\nstopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answering\nhim. But now he could hear nothing. Yes, he could hear something,\nbut not a voice. Footsteps were approaching. Now a door was being\nopened quietly in the passage above; the hinges creaked. Sam\ncrouched down listening. The door closed with a dull thud; and then\na snarling orc-voice rang out.\n\u2018Ho la! You up there, you dunghill rat! Stop your squeaking, or\nI\u2019ll come and deal with you. D\u2019you hear?\u2019\nThere was no answer.\n\u2018All right,\u2019 growled Snaga. \u2018But I\u2019ll come and have a look at you\nall the same, and see what you\u2019re up to.\u2019\nThe hinges creaked again, and Sam, now peering over the corner\nof the passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway,\nand the dim shape of an orc coming out. He seemed to be carrying\na ladder. Suddenly the answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber\nwas reached by a trap-door in the roof of the passage. Snaga thrust\nthe ladder upwards, steadied it, and then clambered out of sight.\nSam heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard the hideous voice\nspeaking again.\n\u2018You lie quiet, or you\u2019ll pay for it! You\u2019ve not got long to live in\npeace, I guess; but if you don\u2019t want the fun to begin right now, keep\nyour trap shut, see? There\u2019s a reminder for you!\u2019 There was a sound\nlike the crack of a whip.\nAt that rage blazed in Sam\u2019s heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up,\nran, and went up the ladder like a cat. His head came out in the middle\nof the floor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof;\nthe westward window-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on\nthe floor by the wall under the window, but over it a black orc-shape\nwas straddled. It raised a whip a second time, but the blow never fell.\nWith a cry Sam leapt across the floor, Sting in hand. The orc\nwheeled round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed its\nwhip-hand from its arm. Howling with pain and fear but desperate"}
{"934": "stumbled over him. Before he could scramble up he heard a cry and\na thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and\nfallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more thought to it.\nHe ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo.\nHe was naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his\narm was flung up, shielding his head, and across his side there ran\nan ugly whip-weal.\n\u2018Frodo! Mr. Frodo, my dear!\u2019 cried Sam, tears almost blinding\nhim. \u2018It\u2019s Sam, I\u2019ve come!\u2019 He half lifted his master and hugged him\nto his breast. Frodo opened his eyes.\n\u2018Am I still dreaming?\u2019 he muttered. \u2018But the other dreams were\nhorrible.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re not dreaming at all, Master,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It\u2019s real. It\u2019s me.\nI\u2019ve come.\u2019\n\u2018I can hardly believe it,\u2019 said Frodo, clutching him. \u2018There was an\norc with a whip, and then it turns into Sam! Then I wasn\u2019t dreaming\nafter all when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer?\nWas it you?\u2019\n\u2018It was indeed, Mr. Frodo. I\u2019d given up hope, almost. I couldn\u2019t\nfind you.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you have now, Sam, dear Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, and he lay back\nin Sam\u2019s gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when\nnight-fears are driven away by some loved voice or hand.\nSam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was\nnot allowed. It was not enough for him to find his master, he had\nstill to try and save him. He kissed Frodo\u2019s forehead. \u2018Come! Wake\nup, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he said, trying to sound as cheerful as he had when\nhe drew back the curtains at Bag End on a summer\u2019s morning.\nFrodo sighed and sat up. \u2018Where are we? How did I get here?\u2019 he\nasked.\n\u2018There\u2019s no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,\u2019\nsaid Sam. \u2018But you\u2019re in the top of that tower you and me saw from\naway down by the tunnel before the orcs got you. How long ago that\nwas I don\u2019t know. More than a day, I guess.\u2019\n\u2018Only that?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It seems weeks. You must tell me all\nabout it, if we get a chance. Something hit me, didn\u2019t it? And I fell\ninto darkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was\nworse. Orcs were all round me. I think they had just been pouring\nsome horrible burning drink down my throat. My head grew clear,\nbut I was aching and weary. They stripped me of everything; and\nthen two great brutes came and questioned me, questioned me until"}
{"935": "\u2018You won\u2019t, if you talk about them, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And\nif we don\u2019t want to see them again, the sooner we get going the\nbetter. Can you walk?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I can walk,\u2019 said Frodo, getting up slowly. \u2018I am not hurt,\nSam. Only I feel very tired, and I\u2019ve a pain here.\u2019 He put his hand\nto the back of his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it\nlooked to Sam as if he was clothed in flame: his naked skin was\nscarlet in the light of the lamp above. Twice he paced across the\nfloor.\n\u2018That\u2019s better!\u2019 he said, his spirits rising a little. \u2018I didn\u2019t dare to\nmove when I was left alone, or one of the guards came. Until the\nyelling and fighting began. The two big brutes: they quarrelled, I\nthink. Over me and my things. I lay here terrified. And then all went\ndeadly quiet, and that was worse.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, they quarrelled, seemingly,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018There must have been\na couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place. A bit of a\ntall order for Sam Gamgee, as you might say. But they\u2019ve done all\nthe killing of themselves. That\u2019s lucky, but it\u2019s too long to make a\nsong about, till we\u2019re out of here. Now what\u2019s to be done? You can\u2019t\ngo walking in the Black Land in naught but your skin, Mr. Frodo.\u2019\n\u2018They\u2019ve taken everything, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Everything I had.\nDo you understand? Everything!\u2019 He cowered on the floor again with\nbowed head, as his own words brought home to him the fullness of\nthe disaster, and despair overwhelmed him. \u2018The quest has failed,\nSam. Even if we get out of here, we can\u2019t escape. Only Elves can\nescape. Away, away out of Middle-earth, far away over the Sea. If\neven that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out.\u2019\n\u2018No, not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it hasn\u2019t failed, not yet. I\ntook it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon. And I\u2019ve kept it safe. It\u2019s\nround my neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.\u2019 Sam fumbled\nfor the Ring and its chain. \u2018But I suppose you must take it back.\u2019\nNow it had come to it, Sam felt reluctant to give up the Ring and\nburden his master with it again.\n\u2018You\u2019ve got it?\u2019 gasped Frodo. \u2018You\u2019ve got it here? Sam, you\u2019re a\nmarvel!\u2019 Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. \u2018Give it to\nme!\u2019 he cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. \u2018Give it\nme at once! You can\u2019t have it!\u2019\n\u2018All right, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam, rather startled. \u2018Here it is!\u2019 Slowly\nhe drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head. \u2018But you\u2019re\nin the land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you\u2019ll see the\nFiery Mountain and all. You\u2019ll find the Ring very dangerous now,\nand very hard to bear. If it\u2019s too hard a job, I could share it with"}
{"936": "hands. \u2018No you won\u2019t, you thief !\u2019 He panted, staring at Sam with\neyes wide with fear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the Ring\nin one clenched fist, he stood aghast. A mist seemed to clear from\nhis eyes, and he passed a hand over his aching brow. The hideous\nvision had seemed so real to him, half bemused as he was still with\nwound and fear. Sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc\nagain, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little creature with\ngreedy eyes and slobbering mouth. But now the vision had passed.\nThere was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if\nhe had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes.\n\u2018O Sam!\u2019 cried Frodo. \u2018What have I said? What have I done?\nForgive me! After all you have done. It is the horrible power of the\nRing. I wish it had never, never, been found. But don\u2019t mind me,\nSam. I must carry the burden to the end. It can\u2019t be altered. You\ncan\u2019t come between me and this doom.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s all right, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam, rubbing his sleeve across\nhis eyes. \u2018I understand. But I can still help, can\u2019t I? I\u2019ve got to get\nyou out of here. At once, see! But first you want some clothes and\ngear, and then some food. The clothes will be the easiest part. As\nwe\u2019re in Mordor, we\u2019d best dress up Mordor-fashion; and anyway\nthere isn\u2019t no choice. It\u2019ll have to be orc-stuff for you, Mr. Frodo,\nI\u2019m afraid. And for me too. If we go together, we\u2019d best match. Now\nput this round you!\u2019\nSam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo\u2019s shoulders.\nThen unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. He drew Sting from\nits sheath. Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade. \u2018I was\nforgetting this, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 he said. \u2018No, they didn\u2019t get everything!\nYou lent me Sting, if you remember, and the Lady\u2019s glass. I\u2019ve got\nthem both still. But lend them to me a little longer, Mr. Frodo. I\nmust go and see what I can find. You stay here. Walk about a bit\nand ease your legs. I shan\u2019t be long. I shan\u2019t have to go far.\u2019\n\u2018Take care, Sam!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018And be quick! There may be orcs\nstill alive, lurking in wait.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve got to chance it,\u2019 said Sam. He stepped to the trap-door and\nslipped down the ladder. In a minute his head reappeared. He threw\na long knife on the floor.\n\u2018There\u2019s something that might be useful,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s dead: the\none that whipped you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now\nyou draw up the ladder, if you can, Mr. Frodo; and don\u2019t you let it\ndown till you hear me call the pass-word. Elbereth I\u2019ll call. What the\nElves say. No orc would say that.\u2019"}
{"937": "about him, and to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro,\nprying and peering into every corner of his prison.\nIt was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least,\nbefore he heard Sam\u2019s voice calling softly from below: Elbereth,\nElbereth. Frodo let down the light ladder. Up came Sam, puffing,\nheaving a great bundle on his head. He let it fall with a thud.\n\u2018Quick now, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve had a bit of a search to\nfind anything small enough for the likes of us. We\u2019ll have to make\ndo. But we must hurry. I\u2019ve met nothing alive, and I\u2019ve seen nothing,\nbut I\u2019m not easy. I think this place is being watched. I can\u2019t explain\nit, but well: it feels to me as if one of those foul flying Riders was\nabout, up in the blackness where he can\u2019t be seen.\u2019\nHe opened the bundle. Frodo looked in disgust at the contents,\nbut there was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked.\nThere were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a\ntunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat\nof stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and\nheavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath\nholding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword. Sam had brought several\norc-helmets. One of them fitted Frodo well enough, a black cap with\niron rim, and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the Evil\nEye was painted in red above the beaklike nose-guard.\n\u2018The Morgul-stuff, Gorbag\u2019s gear, was a better fit and better\nmade,\u2019 said Sam; \u2018but it wouldn\u2019t do, I guess, to go carrying his\ntokens into Mordor, not after this business here. Well, there you are,\nMr. Frodo. A perfect little orc, if I may make so bold \u2013 at least you\nwould be, if we could cover your face with a mask, give you longer\narms, and make you bow-legged. This will hide some of the tell-tales.\u2019\nHe put a large black cloak round Frodo\u2019s shoulders. \u2018Now you\u2019re\nready! You can pick up a shield as we go.\u2019\n\u2018What about you, Sam?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Aren\u2019t we going to match?\u2019\n\u2018Well, Mr. Frodo, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I\u2019d best not leave\nany of my stuff behind, and we can\u2019t destroy it. And I can\u2019t wear\norc-mail over all my clothes, can I? I\u2019ll just have to cover up.\u2019\nHe knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak. It went into\na surprisingly small roll. This he put into his pack that lay on the\nfloor. Standing up, he slung it behind his back, put an orc-helm on\nhis head, and cast another black cloak about his shoulders. \u2018There!\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Now we match, near enough. And now we must be off !\u2019\n\u2018I can\u2019t go all the way at a run, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo with a wry smile.\n\u2018I hope you\u2019ve made inquiries about inns along the road? Or have\nyou forgotten about food and drink?\u2019"}
{"938": "thirsty! I don\u2019t know when drop or morsel last passed my lips. I\u2019d\nforgotten it, trying to find you. But let me think! Last time I looked\nI\u2019d got about enough of that waybread, and of what Captain Faramir\ngave us, to keep me on my legs for a couple of weeks at a pinch. But\nif there\u2019s a drop left in my bottle, there\u2019s no more. That\u2019s not going\nto be enough for two, nohow. Don\u2019t orcs eat, and don\u2019t they drink?\nOr do they just live on foul air and poison?\u2019\n\u2018No, they eat and drink, Sam. The Shadow that bred them can\nonly mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don\u2019t\nthink it gave life to the orcs, it only ruined them and twisted them;\nand if they are to live at all, they have to live like other living creatures.\nFoul waters and foul meats they\u2019ll take, if they can get no better, but\nnot poison.

Indeed they did not take\neverything. I\u2019ve found my food-bag among some rags on the floor.\nThey\u2019ve rummaged it, of course. But I guess they disliked the very\nlook and smell of the lembas, worse than Gollum did. It\u2019s scattered\nabout and some of it is trampled and broken, but I\u2019ve gathered it\ntogether. It\u2019s not far short of what you\u2019ve got. But they\u2019ve taken\nFaramir\u2019s food, and they\u2019ve slashed up my water-bottle.\u2019\n\u2018Well, there\u2019s no more to be said,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018We\u2019ve got enough\nto start on. But the water\u2019s going to be a bad business. But come,\nMr. Frodo! Off we go, or a whole lake of it won\u2019t do us any good!\u2019\n\u2018Not till you\u2019ve had a mouthful, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I won\u2019t budge.\nHere, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle!\nThe whole thing is quite hopeless, so it\u2019s no good worrying about\ntomorrow. It probably won\u2019t come.\u2019\nAt last they started. Down the ladder they climbed, and then Sam\ntook it and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen\norc. The stair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the Mountain\ncould still be seen, though it was dying down now to a sullen red.\nThey picked up two shields to complete their disguise and then\nwent on.\nDown the great stairway they plodded. The high chamber of the\nturret behind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely:\nthey were out in the open again now, and terror ran along the walls.\nAll might be dead in the Tower of Cirith Ungol, but it was steeped\nin fear and evil still."}
{"939": "Watchers beating on them, black silent shapes on either side of the\ngate through which the glare of Mordor dimly showed. As they\nthreaded their way among the hideous bodies of the orcs each step\nbecame more difficult. Before they even reached the archway they\nwere brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and\nweariness to will and limb.\nFrodo had no strength for such a battle. He sank to the ground.\n\u2018I can\u2019t go on, Sam,\u2019 he murmured. \u2018I\u2019m going to faint. I don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s come over me.\u2019\n\u2018I do, Mr. Frodo. Hold up now! It\u2019s the gate. There\u2019s some devilry\nthere. But I got through, and I\u2019m going to get out. It can\u2019t be more\ndangerous than before. Now for it!\u2019\nSam drew out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour\nto his hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown\nhobbit-hand that had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth sud-\ndenly, so that all the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance\nlike lightning; but it remained steady and did not pass.\n\u2018Gilthoniel, A Elbereth!\u2019 Sam cried. For, why he did not know, his\nthought sprang back suddenly to the Elves in the Shire, and the song\nthat drove away the Black Rider in the trees.\n\u2018Aiya elenion ancalima!\u2019 cried Frodo once again behind him.\nThe will of the Watchers was broken with a suddenness like the\nsnapping of a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled forward. Then\nthey ran. Through the gate and past the great seated figures with\ntheir glittering eyes. There was a crack. The keystone of the arch\ncrashed almost on their heels, and the wall above crumbled, and fell\nin ruin. Only by a hair did they escape. A bell clanged; and from the\nWatchers there went up a high and dreadful wail. Far up above in\nthe darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there came drop-\nping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly\nshriek."}
{"940": "Chapter 2\nTHE LAND OF SHADOW\nSam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast.\n\u2018Run, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he cried. \u2018No, not that way! There\u2019s a sheer drop\nover the wall. Follow me!\u2019\nDown the road from the gate they fled. In fifty paces, with a swift\nbend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight\nfrom the Tower. They had escaped for the moment. Cowering back\nagainst the rock they drew breath, and then they clutched at their\nhearts. Perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the Nazgu\u02c6l\nsent out its deadly cries. All the cliffs echoed.\nIn terror they stumbled on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward\nagain and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the\nTower. As they flitted across they glanced back and saw the great\nblack shape upon the battlement; then they plunged down between\nhigh rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the Morgul-road.\nThey came to the way-meeting. There was still no sign of orcs, nor\nof an answer to the cry of the Nazgu\u02c6l; but they knew that the silence\nwould not last long. At any moment now the hunt would begin.\n\u2018This won\u2019t do, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018If we were real orcs, we ought\nto be dashing back to the Tower, not running away. The first enemy\nwe meet will know us. We must get off this road somehow.\u2019\n\u2018But we can\u2019t,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018not without wings.\u2019\nThe eastern faces of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath were sheer, falling in cliff\nand precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner\nridge. A short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline,\na flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across\ninto the tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate\nspurt Frodo and Sam dashed along the bridge; but they had hardly\nreached its further end when they heard the hue and cry begin. Away\nbehind them, now high above on the mountain-side, loomed the Tower\nof Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. Suddenly its harsh bell\nclanged again, and then broke into a shattering peal. Horns sounded.\nAnd now from beyond the bridge-end came answering cries. Down\nin the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of Orodruin, Frodo\nand Sam could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of iron-\nshodfeet,andupontheroadthererangtheswiftclatterofhoofs."}
{"941": "ful drop into the gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen\nalmost to the level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess\nthe depth of the fall.\n\u2018Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Good-bye!\u2019\nHe let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the\nrush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet\nrunning up behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared.\nHalf fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits\nlanded, in a drop of no more than a dozen feet, with a thud and a\ncrunch into the last thing that they had expected: a tangle of thorny\nbushes. There Sam lay still, softly sucking a scratched hand.\nWhen the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whis-\nper. \u2018Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn\u2019t know as anything grew in\nMordor! But if I had a\u2019known, this is just what I\u2019d have looked for.\nThese thorns must be a foot long by the feel of them; they\u2019ve stuck\nthrough everything I\u2019ve got on. Wish I\u2019d a\u2019put that mailshirt on!\u2019\n\u2018Orc-mail doesn\u2019t keep these thorns out,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Not even\na leather jerkin is any good.\u2019\nThey had a struggle to get out of the thicket. The thorns and\nbriars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. Their cloaks\nwere rent and tattered before they broke free at last.\n\u2018Now down we go, Sam,\u2019 Frodo whispered. \u2018Down into the valley\nquick, and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.\u2019\nDay was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the\nglooms of Mordor the Sun was climbing over the eastern rim of\nMiddle-earth; but here all was still dark as night. The Mountain\nsmouldered and its fires went out. The glare faded from the cliffs.\nThe easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they left Ithilien\nnow seemed dead. Slowly and painfully they clambered down, grop-\ning, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in\nthe blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further.\nAt length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a\nboulder. Both were sweating. \u2018If Shagrat himself was to offer me a\nglass of water, I\u2019d shake his hand,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018Don\u2019t say such things!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It only makes it worse.\u2019 Then\nhe stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for\na while. At last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement\nhe found that Sam was asleep. \u2018Wake up, Sam!\u2019 he said. \u2018Come on!\nIt\u2019s time we made another effort.\u2019\nSam scrambled to his feet. \u2018Well I never!\u2019 he said. \u2018I must have\ndropped off. It\u2019s a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep,"}
{"942": "Frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess,\namong the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great\nravine. But presently he stopped again.\n\u2018It\u2019s no good, Sam,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t manage it. This mail-shirt, I\nmean. Not in my present state. Even my mithril-coat seemed heavy\nwhen I was tired. This is far heavier. And what\u2019s the use of it? We\nshan\u2019t win through by fighting.\u2019\n\u2018But we may have some to do,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And there\u2019s knives and\nstray arrows. That Gollum isn\u2019t dead, for one thing. I don\u2019t like to\nthink of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab\nin the dark.\u2019\n\u2018Look here, Sam dear lad,\u2019 said Frodo: \u2018I am tired, weary, I haven\u2019t\na hope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the Mountain, as\nlong as I can move. The Ring is enough. This extra weight is killing\nme. It must go. But don\u2019t think I\u2019m ungrateful. I hate to think of the\nfoul work you must have had among the bodies to find it for me.\u2019\n\u2018Don\u2019t talk about it, Mr. Frodo. Bless you! I\u2019d carry you on my\nback, if I could. Let it go then!\u2019\nFrodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it\naway. He shivered a little. \u2018What I really need is something warm,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018It\u2019s gone cold, or else I\u2019ve caught a chill.\u2019\n\u2018You can have my cloak, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. He unslung his\npack and took out the elven-cloak. \u2018How\u2019s this, Mr. Frodo?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018You wrap that orc-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it.\nThen this can go over all. It don\u2019t look quite orc-fashion, but it\u2019ll\nkeep you warmer; and I daresay it\u2019ll keep you from harm better than\nany other gear. It was made by the Lady.\u2019\nFrodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch. \u2018That\u2019s better!\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018I feel much lighter. I can go on now. But this blind dark seems\nto be getting into my heart. As I lay in prison, Sam, I tried to remem-\nber the Brandywine, and Woody End, and The Water running\nthrough the mill at Hobbiton. But I can\u2019t see them now.\u2019\n\u2018There now, Mr. Frodo, it\u2019s you that\u2019s talking of water this time!\u2019\nsaid Sam. \u2018If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I\u2019d say to her:\n\u2018\u2018Your Ladyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and\nplain daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon.\u2019\u2019 But it\u2019s\na long way to Lo\u00b4rien.\u2019 Sam sighed and waved his hand towards the\nheights of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath, now only to be guessed as a deeper\nblackness against the black sky.\nThey started off again. They had not gone far when Frodo paused.\n\u2018There\u2019s a Black Rider over us,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can feel it. We had better"}
{"943": "and did not speak for some time. Then Frodo breathed a sigh of\nrelief. \u2018It\u2019s passed,\u2019 he said. They stood up, and then they both stared\nin wonder. Away to their left, southward, against a sky that was\nturning grey, the peaks and high ridges of the great range began to\nappear dark and black, visible shapes. Light was growing behind\nthem. Slowly it crept towards the North. There was battle far above\nin the high spaces of the air. The billowing clouds of Mordor were\nbeing driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out of the living\nworld came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark\nland of their home. Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy\ndim light leaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed\nwindow of a prison.\n\u2018Look at it, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Look at it! The wind\u2019s changed.\nSomething\u2019s happening. He\u2019s not having it all his own way. His\ndarkness is breaking up out in the world there. I wish I could see\nwhat is going on!\u2019\nIt was the morning of the fifteenth of March, and over the Vale\nof Anduin the Sun was rising above the eastern shadow, and the\nsouth-west wind was blowing. The\u00b4oden lay dying on the Pelennor\nFields.\nAs Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all\nalong the line of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath, and then they saw a shape, moving\nat a great speed out of the West, at first only a black speck against\nthe glimmering strip above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it\nplunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them.\nAs it went it sent out a long shrill cry, the voice of a Nazgu\u02c6 l; but this\ncry no longer held any terror for them: it was a cry of woe and dismay,\nill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord of the Ringwraiths had met\nhis doom.\n\u2018What did I tell you? Something\u2019s happening!\u2019 cried Sam. \u2018 \u2018\u2018The\nwar\u2019s going well,\u2019\u2019 said Shagrat; but Gorbag he wasn\u2019t so sure. And\nhe was right there too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven\u2019t\nyou got some hope now?\u2019\n\u2018Well no, not much, Sam,\u2019 Frodo sighed. \u2018That\u2019s away beyond\nthe mountains. We\u2019re going east not west. And I\u2019m so tired. And the\nRing is so heavy, Sam. And I begin to see it in my mind all the time,\nlike a great wheel of fire.\u2019\nSam\u2019s quick spirits sank again at once. He looked at his master\nanxiously, and he took his hand. \u2018Come, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve\ngot one thing I wanted: a bit of light. Enough to help us, and yet I\nguess it\u2019s dangerous too. Try a bit further, and then we\u2019ll lie close\nand have a rest. But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves\u2019"}
{"944": "Sharing a wafer of lembas, and munching it as best they could with\ntheir parched mouths, Frodo and Sam plodded on. The light, though\nno more than a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they\nwere deep in the valley between the mountains. It sloped up gently\nnorthward, and at its bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered\nstream. Beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that wound\nits way under the feet of the westward cliffs. Had they known, they\ncould have reached it quicker, for it was a track that left the main\nMorgul-road at the western bridge-end and went down by a long\nstair cut in the rock to the valley\u2019s bottom. It was used by patrols or by\nmessengers going swiftly to lesser posts and strongholds north-away,\nbetween Cirith Ungol and the narrows of Isenmouthe, the iron jaws\nof Carach Angren.\nIt was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path, but they needed\nspeed, and Frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling\namong the boulders or in the trackless glens of the Morgai. And he\njudged that northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would\nleast expect them to take. The road east to the plain, or the pass\nback westward, those they would first search most thoroughly. Only\nwhen he was well north of the Tower did he mean to turn and seek\nfor some way to take him east, east on the last desperate stage of his\njourney. So now they crossed the stony bed and took to the orc-path,\nand for some time they marched along it. The cliffs at their left were\noverhung, and they could not be seen from above; but the path made\nmany bends, and at each bend they gripped their sword-hilts and\nwent forward cautiously.\nThe light grew no stronger, for Orodruin was still belching forth\na great fume that, beaten upwards by the opposing airs, mounted\nhigher and higher, until it reached a region above the wind and spread\nin an immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows\nbeyond their view. They had trudged for more than an hour when\nthey heard a sound that brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but\nunmistakable. Water trickling. Out of a gully on the left, so sharp\nand narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by\nsome huge axe, water came dripping down: the last remains, maybe,\nof some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated to fall at\nlast upon the walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless down into\nthe dust. Here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet,\nand flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be\nlost among the dead stones.\nSam sprang towards it. \u2018If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell\nher!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Light and now water!\u2019 Then he stopped. \u2018Let me"}
{"945": "\u2018I didn\u2019t mean that,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I mean: if it\u2019s poisonous, or some-\nthing that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you,\nmaster, if you understand me.\u2019\n\u2018I do. But I think we\u2019ll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing.\nStill, be careful now, if it\u2019s very cold!\u2019\nThe water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste,\nat once bitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. Here it\nseemed beyond all praise, and beyond fear or prudence. They drank\ntheir fill, and Sam replenished his water-bottle. After that Frodo felt\neasier, and they went on for several miles, until the broadening of\nthe road and the beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned\nthem that they were drawing near to another orc-hold.\n\u2018This is where we turn aside, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018And we must\nturn east.\u2019 He sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the\nvalley. \u2018I have just about enough strength left to find some hole away\nup there. And then I must rest a little.\u2019\nThe river-bed was now some way below the path. They scrambled\ndown to it, and began to cross it. To their surprise they came upon\ndark pools fed by threads of water trickling down from some source\nhigher up the valley. Upon its outer marges under the westward\nmountains Mordor was a dying land, but it was not yet dead. And\nhere things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, struggling for life. In the\nglens of the Morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees\nlurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the stones,\nand withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great writh-\ning, tangled brambles sprawled. Some had long stabbing thorns, some\nhooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of a\npast year hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their\nmaggot-ridden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or\nblack, marked like orcs with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and\nstung; and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced\nand reeled.\n\u2018Orc-gear\u2019s no good,\u2019 said Sam waving his arms. \u2018I wish I\u2019d got\nan orc\u2019s hide!\u2019\nAt last Frodo could go no further. They had climbed up a narrow\nshelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could\neven come in sight of the last craggy ridge. \u2018I must rest now, Sam,\nand sleep if I can,\u2019 said Frodo. He looked about, but there seemed\nnowhere even for an animal to crawl into in this dismal country. At\nlength, tired out, they slunk under a curtain of brambles that hung\ndown like a mat over a low rock-face."}
{"946": "remained in Sam\u2019s bag of Faramir\u2019s provision: some dried fruit, and\na small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. They had\ndrunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very thirsty\nagain. There was a bitter tang in the air of Mordor that dried the\nmouth. When Sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed.\nBeyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of Gorgoroth to\ncross.\n\u2018Now you go to sleep first, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s getting dark\nagain. I reckon this day is nearly over.\u2019\nFrodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken.\nSam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo\u2019s hand;\nand there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself\nawake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land\nseemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was\nno sound of voice or of foot. Far above the Ephel Du\u00b4 ath in the\nWest the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the\ncloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a\nwhite star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as\nhe looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him.\nFor like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the\nend the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light\nand high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower\nhad been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of\nhimself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his master\u2019s,\nceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid\nhimself by Frodo\u2019s side, and putting away all fear he cast himself\ninto a deep untroubled sleep.\nThey woke together, hand in hand. Sam was almost fresh, ready\nfor another day; but Frodo sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full\nof dreams of fire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep\nhad not been without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able\nto bear his burden one stage further. They did not know the time,\nnor how long they had slept; but after a morsel of food and a sip of\nwater they went on up the ravine, until it ended in a sharp slope of\nscrees and sliding stones. There the last living things gave up their\nstruggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless, bare, jagged, barren\nas a slate.\nAfter much wandering and search they found a way that they could\nclimb, and with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were\nup. They came to a cleft between two dark crags, and passing through\nfoundthemselvesontheveryedgeofthelastfenceofMordor.Below"}
{"947": "The wind of the world blew now from the West, and the great clouds\nwere lifted high, floating away eastward; but still only a grey light\ncame to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes trailed on the\nground and lurked in hollows, and fumes leaked from fissures in the\nearth.\nStill far away, forty miles at least, they saw Mount Doom, its feet\nfounded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where\nits reeking head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now dimmed,\nand it stood in smouldering slumber, as threatening and dangerous\nas a sleeping beast. Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as\na thunder-cloud, the veils of Barad-du\u02c6r that was reared far away upon\na long spur of the Ashen Mountains thrust down from the North.\nThe Dark Power was deep in thought, and the Eye turned inward,\npondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a stern\nand kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other\nthings; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on tower,\nwas wrapped in a brooding gloom.\nFrodo and Sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this\nhateful land. Between them and the smoking mountain, and about\nit north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned\nand choked. They wondered how the Lord of this realm maintained\nand fed his slaves and his armies. Yet armies he had. As far as their\neyes could reach, along the skirts of the Morgai and away southward,\nthere were camps, some of tents, some ordered like small towns. One\nof the largest of these was right below them. Barely a mile out into\nthe plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with straight\ndreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the\nground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it\nsouth-east to join the Morgul-way, and along it many lines of small\nblack shapes were hurrying.\n\u2018I don\u2019t like the look of things at all,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Pretty hopeless,\nI call it \u2013 saving that where there\u2019s such a lot of folk there must be\nwells or water, not to mention food. And these are Men not Orcs,\nor my eyes are all wrong.\u2019\nNeither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave-worked\nfields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Moun-\ntain by the dark sad waters of Lake Nu\u00b4rnen; nor of the great roads\nthat ran away east and south to tributary lands, from which the\nsoldiers of the Tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty\nand fresh slaves. Here in the northward regions were the mines and\nforges, and the musterings of long-planned war; and here the Dark\nPower, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathering"}
{"948": "the moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing\nthem about Cirith Gorgor for an avenging stroke. And if it had also\nbeen its purpose to defend the Mountain against all approach, it\ncould scarcely have done more.\n\u2018Well!\u2019 Sam went on. \u2018Whatever they have to eat and drink, we\ncan\u2019t get it. There\u2019s no way down that I can see. And we couldn\u2019t\ncross all that open country crawling with enemies, even if we did get\ndown.\u2019\n\u2018Still we shall have to try,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It\u2019s no worse than I\nexpected. I never hoped to get across. I can\u2019t see any hope of it now.\nBut I\u2019ve still got to do the best I can. At present that is to avoid being\ncaptured as long as possible. So we must still go northwards, I think,\nand see what it is like where the open plain is narrower.\u2019\n\u2018I guess what it\u2019ll be like,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Where it\u2019s narrower the Orcs\nand Men will just be packed closer. You\u2019ll see, Mr. Frodo.\u2019\n\u2018I dare say I shall, if we ever get so far,\u2019 said Frodo and turned\naway.\nThey soon found that it was impossible to make their way along\nthe crest of the Morgai, or anywhere along its higher levels, pathless\nas they were and scored with deep ghylls. In the end they were forced\nto go back down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way\nalong the valley. It was rough going, for they dared not cross over to\nthe path on the westward side. After a mile or more they saw, huddled\nin a hollow at the cliff \u2019s foot, the orc-hold that they had guessed was\nnear at hand: a wall and a cluster of stone huts set about the dark\nmouth of a cave. There was no movement to be seen, but the hobbits\ncrept by cautiously, keeping as much as they could to the thorn-brakes\nthat grew thickly at this point along both sides of the old water-course.\nThey went two or three miles further, and the orc-hold was hidden\nfrom sight behind them; but they had hardly begun to breathe more\nfreely again when harsh and loud they heard orc-voices. Quickly they\nslunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bush. The voices drew\nnearer. Presently two orcs came into view. One was clad in ragged\nbrown and was armed with a bow of horn; it was of a small breed,\nblack-skinned, with wide and snuffling nostrils: evidently a tracker\nof some kind. The other was a big fighting-orc, like those of Shagrat\u2019s\ncompany, bearing the token of the Eye. He also had a bow at his\nback and carried a short broad-headed spear. As usual they were\nquarrelling, and being of different breeds they used the Common\nSpeech after their fashion.\nHardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc"}
{"949": "more. There\u2019s not a trace left, I say. I\u2019ve lost the scent through giving\nway to you. It went up into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.\u2019\n\u2018Not much use are you, you little snufflers?\u2019 said the big orc. \u2018I\nreckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.\u2019\n\u2018Then what have you seen with them?\u2019 snarled the other. \u2018Garn!\nYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re looking for.\u2019\n\u2018Whose blame\u2019s that?\u2019 said the soldier. \u2018Not mine. That comes\nfrom Higher Up. First they say it\u2019s a great Elf in bright armour, then\nit\u2019s a sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel Uruk-\nhai; or maybe it\u2019s all the lot together.\u2019\n\u2018Ar!\u2019 said the tracker. \u2018They\u2019ve lost their heads, that\u2019s what it is.\nAnd some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if\nwhat I hear is true: Tower raided and all, and hundreds of your lads\ndone in, and prisoner got away. If that\u2019s the way you fighters go on,\nsmall wonder there\u2019s bad news from the battles.\u2019\n\u2018Who says there\u2019s bad news?\u2019 shouted the soldier.\n\u2018Ar! Who says there isn\u2019t?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s cursed rebel-talk, and I\u2019ll stick you, if you don\u2019t shut it\ndown, see?\u2019\n\u2018All right, all right!\u2019 said the tracker. \u2018I\u2019ll say no more and go on\nthinking. But what\u2019s the black sneak got to do with it all? That gobbler\nwith the flapping hands?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know. Nothing, maybe. But he\u2019s up to no good, nosing\naround, I\u2019ll wager. Curse him! No sooner had he slipped us and run\noff than word came he\u2019s wanted alive, wanted quick.\u2019\n\u2018Well, I hope they get him and put him through it,\u2019 growled the\ntracker. \u2018He messed up the scent back there, pinching that cast-off\nmail-shirt that he found, and paddling all round the place before I\ncould get there.\u2019\n\u2018It saved his life anyhow,\u2019 said the soldier. \u2018Why, before I knew\nhe was wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty paces right in the\nback; but he ran on.\u2019\n\u2018Garn! You missed him,\u2019 said the tracker. \u2018First you shoot wild,\nthen you run too slow, and then you send for the poor trackers. I\u2019ve\nhad enough of you.\u2019 He loped off.\n\u2018You come back,\u2019 shouted the soldier, \u2018or I\u2019ll report you!\u2019\n\u2018Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won\u2019t be captain any\nmore.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll give your name and number to the Nazgu\u02c6l,\u2019 said the soldier\nlowering his voice to a hiss. \u2018One of them\u2019s in charge at the Tower\nnow.\u2019\nThe other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage. \u2018You"}

They\u2019ve done in Number One, I\u2019ve heard, and I hope it\u2019s true!\u2019\nThe big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, spring-\ning behind a stone, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell\nwith a crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared.\nFor a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam stirred. \u2018Well,\nI call that neat as neat,\u2019 he said. \u2018If this nice friendliness would spread\nabout in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.\u2019\n\u2018Quietly, Sam,\u2019 Frodo whispered. \u2018There may be others about. We\nhave evidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on\nour tracks than we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam;\nand it has spread to every corner of it. Orcs have always behaved like\nthat, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. But you can\u2019t\nget much hope out of it. They hate us far more, altogether and all\nthe time. If those two had seen us, they would have dropped all their\nquarrel until we were dead.\u2019\nThere was another long silence. Sam broke it again, but with a\nwhisper this time. \u2018Did you hear what they said about that gobbler,\nMr. Frodo? I told you Gollum wasn\u2019t dead yet, didn\u2019t I?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I remember. And I wondered how you knew,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Well, come now! I think we had better not move out from here\nagain, until it has gone quite dark. So you shall tell me how you\nknow, and all about what happened. If you can do it quietly.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll try,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018but when I think of that Stinker I get so hot\nI could shout.\u2019\nThere the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while\nthe drear light of Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night;\nand Sam spoke into Frodo\u2019s ear all that he could find words for\nof Gollum\u2019s treacherous attack, the horror of Shelob, and his own\nadventures with the orcs. When he had finished, Frodo said nothing\nbut took Sam\u2019s hand and pressed it. At length he stirred.\n\u2018Well, I suppose we must be going on again,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wonder\nhow long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and\nthe slinking will be over, and in vain.\u2019 He stood up. \u2018It\u2019s dark, and\nwe cannot use the Lady\u2019s glass. Keep it safe for me, Sam. I have\nnowhere to keep it now, except in my hand, and I shall need both\nhands in the blind night. But Sting I give to you. I have got an\norc-blade, but I do not think it will be my part to strike any blow\nagain.\u2019\nIt was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless"}
{"951": "When a grey light crept back over the western heights, long after day\nhad opened in the lands beyond, they went into hiding again and\nslept a little, turn by turn. In his times of waking Sam was busy with\nthoughts of food. At last when Frodo roused himself and spoke of\neating and making ready for yet another effort, he asked the question\nthat was troubling him most.\n\u2018Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 he said, \u2018but have you any\nnotion how far there is still to go?\u2019\n\u2018No, not any clear notion, Sam,\u2019 Frodo answered. \u2018In Rivendell\nbefore I set out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before\nthe Enemy came back here; but I only remember it vaguely. I remem-\nber clearest that there was a place in the north where the western\nrange and the northern range send out spurs that nearly meet. That\nmust be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the Tower.\nIt might be a good point at which to cross. But of course, if we get\nthere, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, sixty\nmiles from it, I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve\nleagues north from the bridge now. Even if all goes well, I could\nhardly reach the Mountain in a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the\nburden will get very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.\u2019\nSam sighed. \u2018That\u2019s just as I feared,\u2019 he said. \u2018Well, to say nothing\nof water, we\u2019ve got to eat less, Mr. Frodo, or else move a bit quicker,\nat any rate while we\u2019re still in this valley. One more bite and all the\nfood\u2019s ended, save the Elves\u2019 waybread.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll try and be a bit quicker, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, drawing a deep\nbreath. \u2018Come on then! Let\u2019s start another march!\u2019\nIt was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the\nnight. The hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief\nhalts. At the first hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of\nshadow they hid themselves again in a dark hollow under an over-\nhanging stone.\nSlowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been. A\nstrong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor\nfrom the upper airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the\nshape of the land for some miles about them. The trough between\nthe mountains and the Morgai had steadily dwindled as it climbed\nupwards, and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf in the\nsteep faces of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath; but to the east it fell as sheerly as\never down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water-course came to an end\nin broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a\nhigh barren spur, thrusting eastward like a wall. To meet it there"}
{"952": "Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, beyond which lay the deep dale of\nUdu\u02c6n. In that dale behind the Morannon were the tunnels and deep\narmouries that the servants of Mordor had made for the defence of\nthe Black Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was gathering\nin haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the\nWest. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and\nwatch-fires burned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had been\nraised, and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a\nsingle bridge.\nA few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spur\nbranched away from the main range, stood the old castle of Durthang,\nnow one of the many orc-holds that clustered about the dale of Udu\u02c6n.\nA road, already visible in the growing light, came winding down from\nit, until only a mile or two from where the hobbits lay it turned east\nand ran along a shelf cut in the side of the spur, and so went down\ninto the plain, and on to the Isenmouthe.\nTo the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey\nnorth had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky,\nand they could see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all\nthat region was under the vigilance of the forts of Carach Angren.\n\u2018We have come to a dead end, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018If we go on, we\nshall only come up to that orc-tower, but the only road to take is\nthat road that comes down from it \u2013 unless we go back. We can\u2019t\nclimb up westward, or climb down eastward.\u2019\n\u2018Then we must take the road, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018We must\ntake it and chance our luck, if there is any luck in Mordor. We might\nas well give ourselves up as wander about any more, or try to go\nback. Our food won\u2019t last. We\u2019ve got to make a dash for it!\u2019\n\u2018All right, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Lead me! As long as you\u2019ve got any\nhope left. Mine is gone. But I can\u2019t dash, Sam. I\u2019ll just plod along\nafter you.\u2019\n\u2018Before you start any more plodding, you need sleep and food,\nMr. Frodo. Come and take what you can get of them!\u2019\nHe gave Frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread,\nand he made a pillow of his cloak for his master\u2019s head. Frodo was\ntoo weary to debate the matter, and Sam did not tell him that he\nhad drunk the last drop of their water, and eaten Sam\u2019s share of the\nfood as well as his own. When Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him\nand listened to his breathing and scanned his face. It was lined and\nthin, and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid. \u2018Well, here\ngoes, Master!\u2019 Sam muttered to himself. \u2018I\u2019ll have to leave you for a\nbit and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we\u2019ll get no further.\u2019"}
{"953": "for some way as it climbed north, until he came to the rock-steps\nwhere long ago, no doubt, its spring had come gushing down in a\nlittle waterfall. All now seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair\nSam stooped and listened, and to his delight he caught the sound of\ntrickling. Clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream of dark\nwater that came out from the hill-side and filled a little bare pool,\nfrom which again it spilled, and vanished then under the barren\nstones.\nSam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank\ndeeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment\nhe caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the\nrocks away near Frodo\u2019s hiding-place. Biting back a cry, he leapt\ndown from the spring and ran, jumping from stone to stone. It was\na wary creature, difficult to see, but Sam had little doubt about it:\nhe longed to get his hands on its neck. But it heard him coming and\nslipped quickly away. Sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of\nit, peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice, before it\nducked and disappeared.\n\u2018Well, luck did not let me down,\u2019 muttered Sam, \u2018but that was a\nnear thing! Isn\u2019t it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that\nstinking villain coming nosing round? I wish he had been shot!\u2019 He\nsat down by Frodo and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to\ngo to sleep himself. At last when he felt his eyes closing and knew\nthat his struggle to keep awake could not go on much longer, he\nwakened Frodo gently.\n\u2018That Gollum\u2019s about again, I\u2019m afraid, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018Leastways, if it wasn\u2019t him, then there\u2019s two of him. I went away to\nfind some water and spied him nosing round just as I turned back.\nI reckon it isn\u2019t safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your\npardon, but I can\u2019t hold up my lids much longer.\u2019\n\u2018Bless you, Sam!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Lie down and take your proper\nturn! But I\u2019d rather have Gollum than orcs. At any rate he won\u2019t\ngive us away to them \u2013 not unless he\u2019s caught himself.\u2019\n\u2018But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,\u2019 growled\nSam. \u2018Keep your eyes open, Mr. Frodo! There\u2019s a bottle full of water.\nDrink up. We can fill it again when we go on.\u2019 With that Sam plunged\ninto sleep.\nLight was fading again when he woke. Frodo sat propped against\nthe rock behind, but he had fallen asleep. The water-bottle was\nempty. There was no sign of Gollum.\nMordor-dark had returned, and the watch-fires on the heights"}
{"954": "spring, and then climbing warily up they came to the road at the\npoint where it swung east towards the Isenmouthe twenty miles away.\nIt was not a broad road, and it had no wall or parapet along the\nedge, and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and\ndeeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and after listening for\na while they set off eastward at a steady pace.\nAfter doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short way back the\nroad had bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed\nover was now screened from sight. This proved disastrous. They\nrested for some minutes and then went on; but they had not taken\nmany steps when suddenly in the stillness of the night they heard the\nsound that all along they had secretly dreaded: the noise of marching\nfeet. It was still some way behind them, but looking back they could\nsee the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile\naway, and they were moving fast: too fast for Frodo to escape by\nflight along the road ahead.\n\u2018I feared it, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018We\u2019ve trusted to luck, and it has\nfailed us. We\u2019re trapped.\u2019 He looked wildly up at the frowning wall,\nwhere the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many\nfathoms above their heads. He ran to the other side and looked over\nthe brink into a dark pit of gloom. \u2018We\u2019re trapped at last!\u2019 he said.\nHe sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head.\n\u2018Seems so,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Well, we can but wait and see.\u2019 And with\nthat he sat down beside Frodo under the shadow of the cliff.\nThey did not have to wait long. The orcs were going at a great\npace. Those in the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red\nflames in the dark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head,\nhoping that it would hide his face when the torches reached them;\nand he set their shields before their knees to hide their feet.\n\u2018If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers\nalone and pass on!\u2019 he thought.\nAnd so it seemed that they would. The leading orcs came loping\nalong, panting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of the\nsmaller breeds being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord\u2019s wars; all\nthey cared for was to get the march over and escape the whip. Beside\nthem, running up and down the line, went two of the large fierce\nuruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File after file passed, and the\ntell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. Sam held his breath.\nNow more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly one of the\nslave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. He flicked a whip\nat them and yelled: \u2018Hi, you! Get up!\u2019 They did not answer, and with\na shout he halted the whole company."}

Up you get and fall in, or I\u2019ll have your\nnumbers and report you.\u2019\nThey struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore\nsoldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. \u2018No, not at\nthe rear!\u2019 the slave-driver shouted. \u2018Three files up. And stay there,\nor you\u2019ll know it, when I come down the line!\u2019 He sent his long\nwhip-lash cracking over their heads; then with another crack and a\nyell he started the company off again at a brisk trot.\nIt was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for Frodo\nit was a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried\nto stop his mind from thinking, and he struggled on. The stench of\nthe sweating orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp with\nthirst. On, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw his breath\nand to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil end he toiled\nand endured he did not dare to think. There was no hope of falling\nout unseen. Now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeered at\nthem.\n\u2018There now!\u2019 he laughed, flicking at their legs. \u2018Where there\u2019s a\nwhip there\u2019s a will, my slugs. Hold up!

He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam\ntried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could\nhimself hardly stay the pace much longer. At any moment now he\nknew that the end would come: his master would faint or fall, and\nall would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain. \u2018I\u2019ll have\nthat big slave-driving devil anyway,\u2019 he thought.\nThen just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there\ncame an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and\ndrawing near the entrance to Udu\u02c6n. Some way in front of it, before\nthe gate at the bridge-end, the road from the west converged with\nothers coming from the south, and from Barad-du\u02c6r. Along all the\nroads troops were moving; for the Captains of the West were advanc-\ning and the Dark Lord was speeding his forces north. So it chanced\nthat several companies came together at the road-meeting, in the\ndark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. At once there"}

He heard the\nscuffling and cries die down as the troops passed on through the\nIsenmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion and the mingling of\nmany companies of various kinds they had not been missed, not yet\nat any rate.\nSam took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo to drink, and when\nhis master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their\nprecious waybread and made him eat it. Then, too worn out even to\nfeel much fear, they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in\nuneasy fits; for their sweat grew chill on them, and the hard stones\nbit them, and they shivered. Out of the north from the Black Gate\nthrough Cirith Gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a\nthin cold air.\nIn the morning a grey light came again, for in the high regions the\nWest Wind still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of\nthe Black Land the air seemed almost dead, chill and yet stifling.\nSam looked up out of the hollow. The land all about was dreary, flat\nand drab-hued. On the roads nearby nothing was moving now; but\nSam feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the Isenmouthe, no more\nthan a furlong away northward. South-eastward, far off like a dark\nstanding shadow, loomed the Mountain. Smokes were pouring from\nit, and while those that rose into the upper air trailed away eastward,\ngreat rolling clouds floated down its sides and spread over the land.\nA few miles to the north-east the foothills of the Ashen Mountains\nstood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty northern\nheights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the lowering\nsky.\nSam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they\nought to take. \u2018It looks every step of fifty miles,\u2019 he muttered gloomily,\nstaring at the threatening mountain, \u2018and that\u2019ll take a week, if it\ntakes a day, with Mr. Frodo as he is.\u2019 He shook his head, and as he\nworked things out, slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind."}

Things all went wrong when he went\ndown in Moria. I wish he hadn\u2019t. He would have done something.\u2019\nBut even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to\na new strength. Sam\u2019s plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as\nthe will hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill,\nas if he was turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither\ndespair nor weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue.\nWith a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the\nground near at hand, studying the next move. As the light grew a\nlittle he saw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed\nwide and featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled. Indeed\nthe whole surface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great\nholes, as if, while it was still a waste of soft mud, it had been smitten\nwith a shower of bolts and huge slingstones. The largest of these\nholes were rimmed with ridges of broken rock, and broad fissures\nran out from them in all directions. It was a land in which it would\nbe possible to creep from hiding to hiding, unseen by all but the\nmost watchful eyes: possible at least for one who was strong and had\nno need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go\nbefore life failed, it had an evil look.\nThinking of all these things Sam went back to his master. He had\nno need to rouse him. Frodo was lying on his back with eyes open,\nstaring at the cloudy sky. \u2018Well, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018I\u2019ve been\nhaving a look round and thinking a bit. There\u2019s nothing on the roads,\nand we\u2019d best be getting away while there\u2019s a chance. Can you man-\nage it?\u2019\n\u2018I can manage it,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I must.\u2019\nOnce more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting\nbehind such cover as they could find, but moving always in a slant\ntowards the foothills of the northern range. But as they went the\nmost easterly of the roads followed them, until it ran off, hugging"}
{"959": "for the Dark Lord had almost completed the movement of his forces,\nand even in the fastness of his own realm he sought the secrecy of\nnight, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against him,\ntearing aside his veils, and troubled with tidings of bold spies that\nhad passed through his fences.\nThe hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted. Frodo\nseemed nearly spent. Sam saw that he could not go much further in\nthis fashion, crawling, stooping, now picking a doubtful way very\nslowly, now hurrying at a stumbling run.\n\u2018I\u2019m going back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr. Frodo,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018Trust to luck again! It nearly failed us last time, but it didn\u2019t\nquite. A steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.\u2019\nHe was taking a far greater risk than he knew; but Frodo was too\nmuch occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to\ndebate, and almost too hopeless to care. They climbed on to the\ncauseway and trudged along, down the hard cruel road that led to\nthe Dark Tower itself. But their luck held, and for the rest of that\nday they met no living or moving thing; and when night fell they\nvanished into the darkness of Mordor. All the land now brooded as\nat the coming of a great storm: for the Captains of the West had\npassed the Cross-roads and set flames in the deadly fields of Imlad\nMorgul.\nSo the desperate journey went on, as the Ring went south and the\nbanners of the kings rode north. For the hobbits each day, each mile,\nwas more bitter than the one before, as their strength lessened and\nthe land became more evil. They met no enemies by day. At times\nby night, as they cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside\nthe road, they heard cries and the noise of many feet or the swift\npassing of some cruelly ridden steed. But far worse than all such\nperils was the ever-approaching threat that beat upon them as they\nwent: the dreadful menace of the Power that waited, brooding in\ndeep thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its\nThrone. Nearer and nearer it drew, looming blacker, like the on-\ncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world.\nThere came at last a dreadful nightfall; and even as the Captains\nof the West drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers\ncame to an hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they\nhad escaped from the orcs, but the time lay behind them like an\never-darkening dream. All this last day Frodo had not spoken, but\nhad walked half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw\nthe way before his feet. Sam guessed that among all their pains he\nboretheworst,thegrowingweightoftheRing,aburdenonthebody"}

Sam watched him, till night covered them\nboth and hid them from one another. He could no longer find any\nwords to say; and he turned to his own dark thoughts. As for himself,\nthough weary and under a shadow of fear, he still had some strength\nleft. The lembas had a virtue without which they would long ago have\nlain down to die. It did not satisfy desire, and at times Sam\u2019s mind\nwas filled with the memories of food, and the longing for simple\nbread and meats. And yet this waybread of the Elves had a potency\nthat increased as travellers relied on it alone and did not mingle it\nwith other foods. It fed the will, and it gave strength to endure, and\nto master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind. But\nnow a new decision must be made. They could not follow this road\nany longer; for it went on eastward into the great Shadow, but the\nMountain now loomed upon their right, almost due south, and they\nmust turn towards it. Yet still before it there stretched a wide region\nof fuming, barren, ash-ridden land.\n\u2018Water, water!\u2019 muttered Sam. He had stinted himself, and in his\nparched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his\ncare they now had very little left, perhaps half his bottle, and maybe\nthere were still days to go. All would long ago have been spent, if\nthey had not dared to follow the orc-road. For at long intervals on\nthat highway cisterns had been built for the use of troops sent in\nhaste through the waterless regions. In one Sam had found some\nwater left, stale, muddied by the orcs, but still sufficient for their\ndesperate case. Yet that was now a day ago. There was no hope of\nany more.\nAt last wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow\ntill it came; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled\nuneasily. He saw lights like gloating eyes, and dark creeping shapes,\nand he heard noises as of wild beasts or the dreadful cries of tortured\nthings; and he would start up to find the world all dark and only\nempty blackness all about him. Once only, as he stood and stared\nwildly round, did it seem that, though now awake, he could still see\npale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished.\nThe hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly.

Don\u2019t touch\nme!\u2019 he cried. \u2018It is mine, I say. Be off !\u2019 His hand strayed to his\nsword-hilt. But then quickly his voice changed. \u2018No, no, Sam,\u2019 he\nsaid sadly. \u2018But you must understand. It is my burden, and no one\nelse can bear it. It is too late now, Sam dear. You can\u2019t help me in\nthat way again. I am almost in its power now. I could not give it up,\nand if you tried to take it I should go mad.\u2019\nSam nodded. \u2018I understand,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I\u2019ve been thinking, Mr.\nFrodo, there\u2019s other things we might do without. Why not lighten\nthe load a bit? We\u2019re going that way now, as straight as we can make\nit.\u2019 He pointed to the Mountain. \u2018It\u2019s no good taking anything we\u2019re\nnot sure to need.\u2019\nFrodo looked again towards the Mountain. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018we\nshan\u2019t need much on that road. And at its end nothing.\u2019 Picking up\nhis orc-shield he flung it away and threw his helmet after it. Then\npulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy belt and let it fall to\nthe ground, and the sheathed sword with it. The shreds of the black\ncloak he tore off and scattered.\n\u2018There, I\u2019ll be an orc no more,\u2019 he cried, \u2018and I\u2019ll bear no weapon,\nfair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!\u2019\nSam did likewise, and put aside his orc-gear; and he took out all\nthe things in his pack. Somehow each of them had become dear to\nhim, if only because he had borne them so far with so much toil.\nHardest of all it was to part with his cooking-gear. Tears welled in\nhis eyes at the thought of casting it away.\n\u2018Do you remember that bit of rabbit, Mr. Frodo?\u2019 he said. \u2018And\nour place under the warm bank in Captain Faramir\u2019s country, the\nday I saw an oliphaunt?\u2019"}

I begin to see\nit even with my waking eyes, and all else fades.\u2019\nSam went to him and kissed his hand. \u2018Then the sooner we\u2019re rid\nof it, the sooner to rest,\u2019 he said haltingly, finding no better words\nto say. \u2018Talking won\u2019t mend nothing,\u2019 he muttered to himself, as he\ngathered up all the things that they had chosen to cast away. He was\nnot willing to leave them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes\nto see. \u2018Stinker picked up that orc-shirt, seemingly, and he isn\u2019t going\nto add a sword to it. His hands are bad enough when empty. And\nhe isn\u2019t going to mess with my pans!\u2019 With that he carried all the\ngear away to one of the many gaping fissures that scored the land\nand threw them in. The clatter of his precious pans as they fell down\ninto the dark was like a death-knell to his heart.\nHe came back to Frodo, and then of his elven-rope he cut a short\npiece to serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close\nabout his waist. The rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack.\nBeside that he kept only the remnants of their waybread and the\nwater-bottle, and Sting still hanging by his belt; and hidden away in\na pocket of his tunic next his breast the phial of Galadriel and the\nlittle box that she gave him for his own.\nNow at last they turned their faces to the Mountain and set out,\nthinking no more of concealment, bending their weariness and failing\nwills only to the one task of going on. In the dimness of its dreary\nday few things even in that land of vigilance could have espied them,\nsave from close at hand. Of all the slaves of the Dark Lord, only the\nNazgu\u02c6l could have warned him of the peril that crept, small but\nindomitable, into the very heart of his guarded realm. But the Nazgu\u02c6l\nand their black wings were abroad on other errand: they were gath-\nered far away, shadowing the march of the Captains of the West,\nand thither the thought of the Dark Tower was turned.\nThat day it seemed to Sam that his master had found some new\nstrength, more than could be explained by the small lightening of\nthe load that he had to carry. In the first marches they went further\nand faster than he had hoped. The land was rough and hostile, and\nyet they made much progress, and ever the Mountain drew nearer.\nBut as the day wore on and all too soon the dim light began to fail,\nFrodo stooped again, and began to stagger, as if the renewed effort\nhad squandered his remaining strength.\nAt their last halt he sank down and said: \u2018I\u2019m thirsty, Sam,\u2019 and"}
{"963": "more the night of Mordor closed over them, through all his thoughts\nthere came the memory of water; and every brook or stream or fount\nthat he had ever seen, under green willow-shades or twinkling in the\nsun, danced and rippled for his torment behind the blindness of his\neyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the Pool\nat Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their sister\nRosie. \u2018But that was years ago,\u2019 he sighed, \u2018and far away. The way\nback, if there is one, goes past the Mountain.\u2019\nHe could not sleep and he held a debate with himself. \u2018Well, come\nnow, we\u2019ve done better than you hoped,\u2019 he said sturdily. \u2018Began\nwell anyway. I reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped.\nOne more day will do it.\u2019 And then he paused.\n\u2018Don\u2019t be a fool, Sam Gamgee,\u2019 came an answer in his own voice.\n\u2018He won\u2019t go another day like that, if he moves at all. And you can\u2019t\ngo on much longer giving him all the water and most of the food.\u2019\n\u2018I can go on a good way though, and I will.\u2019\n\u2018Where to?\u2019\n\u2018To the Mountain, of course.\u2019\n\u2018But what then, Sam Gamgee, what then? When you get there,\nwhat are you going to do? He won\u2019t be able to do anything for\nhimself.\u2019\nTo his dismay Sam realized that he had not got an answer to this.\nHe had no clear idea at all. Frodo had not spoken much to him of\nhis errand, and Sam only knew vaguely that the Ring had somehow\nto be put into the fire. \u2018The Cracks of Doom,\u2019 he muttered, the old\nname rising to his mind. \u2018Well, if Master knows how to find them,\nI don\u2019t.\u2019\n\u2018There you are!\u2019 came the answer. \u2018It\u2019s all quite useless. He said\nso himself. You are the fool, going on hoping and toiling. You could\nhave lain down and gone to sleep together days ago, if you hadn\u2019t\nbeen so dogged. But you\u2019ll die just the same, or worse. You might\njust as well lie down now and give it up. You\u2019ll never get to the top\nanyway.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll get there, if I leave everything but my bones behind,\u2019 said\nSam. \u2018And I\u2019ll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and\nheart. So stop arguing!\u2019\nAt that moment Sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him,\nand he heard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder\nimprisoned under the earth. There was a brief red flame that flickered\nunder the clouds and died away. The Mountain too slept uneasily.\nThe last stage of their journey to Orodruin came, and it was a"}
{"964": "mouthful of food. It remained dark, not only because of the smokes of\nthe Mountain: there seemed to be a storm coming up, and away to\nthe south-east there was a shimmer of lightnings under the black skies.\nWorst of all, the air was full of fumes; breathing was painful and\ndifficult, and a dizziness came on them, so that they staggered and\noften fell. And yet their wills did not yield, and they struggled on.\nThe Mountain crept up ever nearer, until, if they lifted their heavy\nheads, it filled all their sight, looming vast before them: a huge mass\nof ash and slag and burned stone, out of which a sheer-sided cone\nwas raised into the clouds. Before the daylong dusk ended and true\nnight came again they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet.\nWith a gasp Frodo cast himself on the ground. Sam sat by him.\nTo his surprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear\nagain. No more debates disturbed his mind. He knew all the argu-\nments of despair and would not listen to them. His will was set, and\nonly death would break it. He felt no longer either desire or need of\nsleep, but rather of watchfulness. He knew that all the hazards and\nperils were now drawing together to a point: the next day would be\na day of doom, the day of final effort or disaster, the last gasp.\nBut when would it come? The night seemed endless and timeless,\nminute after minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour,\nbringing no change. Sam began to wonder if a second darkness had\nbegun and no day would ever reappear. At last he groped for Frodo\u2019s\nhand. It was cold and trembling. His master was shivering.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t ought to have left my blanket behind,\u2019 muttered Sam;\nand lying down he tried to comfort Frodo with his arms and body.\nThen sleep took him, and the dim light of the last day of their quest\nfound them side by side. The wind had fallen the day before as it\nshifted from the West, and now it came from the North and began\nto rise; and slowly the light of the unseen Sun filtered down into the\nshadows where the hobbits lay.\n\u2018Now for it! Now for the last gasp!\u2019 said Sam as he struggled to\nhis feet. He bent over Frodo, rousing him gently. Frodo groaned;\nbut with a great effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon\nhis knees again. He raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes\nof Mount Doom towering above him, and then pitifully he began to\ncrawl forward on his hands.\nSam looked at him and wept in his heart, but no tears came to\nhis dry and stinging eyes. \u2018I said I\u2019d carry him, if it broke my back,\u2019\nhe muttered, \u2018and I will!\u2019\n\u2018Come, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I can\u2019t carry it for you, but I can"}
{"965": "As Frodo clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs\nclasped firmly under his arms, Sam staggered to his feet; and then\nto his amazement he felt the burden light. He had feared that he\nwould have barely strength to lift his master alone, and beyond that\nhe had expected to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the\naccursed Ring. But it was not so. Whether because Frodo was so\nworn by his long pains, wound of knife, and venomous sting, and\nsorrow, fear, and homeless wandering, or because some gift of final\nstrength was given to him, Sam lifted Frodo with no more difficulty\nthan if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on\nthe lawns or hayfields of the Shire. He took a deep breath and started\noff.\nThey had reached the Mountain\u2019s foot on its northern side, and\na little to the westward; there its long grey slopes, though broken,\nwere not sheer. Frodo did not speak, and so Sam struggled on as\nbest he could, having no guidance but the will to climb as high as\nmight be before his strength gave out and his will broke. On he\ntoiled, up and up, turning this way and that to lessen the slope, often\nstumbling forward, and at the last crawling like a snail with a heavy\nburden on its back. When his will could drive him no further, and\nhis limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down.\nFrodo opened his eyes and drew a breath. It was easier to breathe\nup here above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below. \u2018Thank\nyou, Sam,\u2019 he said in a cracked whisper. \u2018How far is there to go?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018because I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re\ngoing.\u2019\nHe looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to\nsee how far his last effort had brought him. The Mountain standing\nominous and alone had looked taller than it was. Sam saw now that\nit was less lofty than the high passes of the Ephel Du\u00b4ath which he\nand Frodo had scaled. The confused and tumbled shoulders of its\ngreat base rose for maybe three thousand feet above the plain, and\nabove them was reared half as high again its tall central cone, like a\nvast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater. But already Sam\nwas more than half way up the base, and the plain of Gorgoroth was\ndim below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he\nwould have given a shout, if his parched throat had allowed him; for\namid the rugged humps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a\npath or road. It climbed like a rising girdle from the west and wound\nsnakelike about the Mountain, until before it went round out of view\nit reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side."}
{"966": "guessed that if he could only struggle on just a little way further up,\nthey would strike this path. A gleam of hope returned to him. They\nmight conquer the Mountain yet. \u2018Why, it might have been put there\na-purpose!\u2019 he said to himself. \u2018If it wasn\u2019t there, I\u2019d have to say I\nwas beaten in the end.\u2019\nThe path was not put there for the purposes of Sam. He did not\nknow it, but he was looking at Sauron\u2019s Road from Barad-du\u02c6 rtothe\nSammath Naur, the Chambers of Fire. Out from the Dark Tower\u2019s\nhuge western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron,\nand then passing into the plain it ran for a league between two\nsmoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping causeway that led\nup on to the Mountain\u2019s eastern side. Thence, turning and encircling\nall its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high in the\nupper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance\nthat gazed back east straight to the Window of the Eye in Sauron\u2019s\nshadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked or destroyed by the tumults\nof the Mountain\u2019s furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleared\nagain by the labours of countless orcs.\nSam drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to\nget up the slope to it he did not know. First he must ease his aching\nback. He lay flat beside Frodo for a while. Neither spoke. Slowly the\nlight grew. Suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand\ncame to Sam. It was almost as if he had been called: \u2018Now, now, or\nit will be too late!\u2019 He braced himself and got up. Frodo also seemed\nto have felt the call. He struggled to his knees.\n\u2018I\u2019ll crawl, Sam,\u2019 he gasped.\nSo foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the slope.\nThey came to the path and found that it was broad, paved with\nbroken rubble and beaten ash. Frodo clambered on to it, and then\nmoved as if by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the East.\nFar off the shadows of Sauron hung; but torn by some gust of wind\nout of the world, or else moved by some great disquiet within, the\nmantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew aside; and then he\nsaw, rising black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which\nit stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of\nBarad-du\u02c6r. One moment only it stared out, but as from some great\nwindow immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red,\nthe flicker of a piercing Eye; and then the shadows were furled again\nand the terrible vision was removed.

The thought came suddenly to him: \u2018He\u2019s spotted us! It\u2019s all\nup, or it soon will be. Now, Sam Gamgee, this is the end of ends.\u2019\nAgain he lifted Frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast,\nletting his master\u2019s legs dangle. Then he bowed his head and struggled\noff along the climbing road. It was not as easy a way to take as it\nhad looked at first. By fortune the fires that had poured forth in the\ngreat turmoils when Sam stood upon Cirith Ungol had flowed down\nmainly on the southern and western slopes, and the road on this side\nwas not blocked. Yet in many places it had crumbled away or was\ncrossed by gaping rents. After climbing eastward for some time it\nbent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space.\nThere at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered\nstone once long ago vomited from the Mountain\u2019s furnaces. Panting\nunder his load Sam turned the bend; and even as he did so, out of\nthe corner of his eye, he had a glimpse of something falling from the\ncrag, like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he\npassed.\nA sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the\nbacks of his hands that still clasped his master\u2019s. Then he knew what\nhad happened, for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice.\n\u2018Wicked masster!\u2019 it hissed. \u2018Wicked masster cheats us; cheats\nSme\u00b4agol, gollum. He musstn\u2019t go that way. He musstn\u2019t hurt Pre-\nciouss. Give it to Sme\u00b4agol, yess, give it to us! Give it to uss!\u2019\nWith a violent heave Sam rose up. At once he drew his sword;\nbut he could do nothing. Gollum and Frodo were locked together.\nGollum was tearing at his master, trying to get at the chain and the\nRing. This was probably the only thing that could have roused the\ndying embers of Frodo\u2019s heart and will: an attack, an attempt to\nwrest his treasure from him by force. He fought back with a sudden\nfury that amazed Sam, and Gollum also. Even so things might have\ngone far otherwise, if Gollum himself had remained unchanged; but\nwhatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he had\ntrodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had\nleft grievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing,\nall bones and tight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes,\nbut his malice was no longer matched by his old griping strength.\nFrodo flung him off and rose up quivering.\n\u2018Down, down!\u2019 he gasped, clutching his hand to his breast, so that\nbeneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the Ring. \u2018Down,"}

A crouching shape, scarcely\nmore than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined\nand defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it\nstood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but\nat its breast it held a wheel of fire. Out of the fire there spoke a\ncommanding voice.\n\u2018Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again,\nyou shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.\u2019\nThe crouching shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and\nyet at the same time insatiable desire.\nThen the vision passed and Sam saw Frodo standing, hand on\nbreast, his breath coming in great gasps, and Gollum at his feet,\nresting on his knees with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground.\n\u2018Look out!\u2019 cried Sam. \u2018He\u2019ll spring!\u2019 He stepped forward, bran-\ndishing his sword. \u2018Quick, Master!\u2019 he gasped. \u2018Go on! Go on! No\ntime to lose. I\u2019ll deal with him. Go on!\u2019\nFrodo looked at him as if at one now far away. \u2018Yes, I must go\non,\u2019 he said. \u2018Farewell, Sam! This is the end at last. On Mount Doom\ndoom shall fall. Farewell!\u2019 He turned and went on, walking slowly\nbut erect, up the climbing path.\n\u2018Now!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018At last I can deal with you!\u2019 He leaped forward\nwith drawn blade ready for battle. But Gollum did not spring. He\nfell flat upon the ground and whimpered.\n\u2018Don\u2019t kill us,\u2019 he wept. \u2018Don\u2019t hurt us with nassty cruel steel! Let\nus live, yes, live just a little longer. Lost lost! We\u2019re lost. And when\nPrecious goes we\u2019ll die, yes, die into the dust.\u2019 He clawed up the\nashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. \u2018Dusst!\u2019 he hissed.\nSam\u2019s hand wavered. His mind was hot with wrath and the\nmemory of evil. It would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous\ncreature, just and many times deserved; and also it seemed the only\nsafe thing to do. But deep in his heart there was something that\nrestrained him: he could not strike this thing lying in the dust, forlorn,\nruinous, utterly wretched. He himself, though only for a little while,\nhad borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed the agony of Gollum\u2019s\nshrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that Ring, unable to find peace\nor relief ever in life again. But Sam had no words to express what he\nfelt.\n\u2018Oh, curse you, you stinking thing!\u2019 he said. \u2018Go away! Be off ! I\ndon\u2019t trust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I shall\nhurt you, yes, with nasty cruel steel.\u2019"}

If he had looked\nback, he might have seen not far below Gollum turn again, and then\nwith a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come, swiftly but\nwarily, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the stones.\nThe path climbed on. Soon it bent again and with a last eastward\ncourse passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to\nthe dark door in the Mountain\u2019s side, the door of the Sammath Naur.\nFar away now rising towards the South the sun, piercing the smokes\nand haze, burned ominous, a dull bleared disc of red; but all Mordor\nlay about the Mountain like a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, wait-\ning for some dreadful stroke.\nSam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and\nhot, and a deep rumbling shook the air. \u2018Frodo! Master!\u2019 he called.\nThere was no answer. For a moment he stood, his heart beating with\nwild fears, and then he plunged in. A shadow followed him.\nAt first he could see nothing. In his great need he drew out once\nmore the phial of Galadriel, but it was pale and cold in his trembling\nhand and threw no light into that stifling dark. He was come to the\nheart of the realm of Sauron and the forges of his ancient might,\ngreatest in Middle-earth; all other powers were here subdued. Fear-\nfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once\nthere came a flash of red that leaped upward, and smote the high\nblack roof. Then Sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that\nbored into the Mountain\u2019s smoking cone. But only a short way ahead\nits floor and the walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure,\nout of which the red glare came, now leaping up, now dying down\ninto darkness; and all the while far below there was a rumour and a\ntrouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring.\nThe light sprang up again, and there on the brink of the chasm,\nat the very Crack of Doom, stood Frodo, black against the glare,\ntense, erect, but still as if he had been turned to stone.\n\u2018Master!\u2019 cried Sam.\nThen Frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a\nvoice clearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use,\nand it rose above the throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in\nthe roof and walls.\n\u2018I have come,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I do not choose now to do what I\ncame to do. I will not do this deed. The Ring is mine!\u2019 And suddenly,\nas he set it on his finger, he vanished from Sam\u2019s sight. Sam gasped,"}

The Dark Lord was suddenly\naware of him, and his Eye piercing all shadows looked across the\nplain to the door that he had made; and the magnitude of his own\nfolly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all the devices of\nhis enemies were at last laid bare. Then his wrath blazed in consuming\nflame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For he\nknew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung.\nFrom all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his\nstratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a\ntremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains\nsuddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. For they\nwere forgotten. The whole mind and purpose of the Power that\nwielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the\nMountain.

He was dazed, and blood streaming from his head\ndripped in his eyes. He groped forward, and then he saw a strange\nand terrible thing. Gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like\na mad thing with an unseen foe. To and fro he swayed, now so near\nthe brink that almost he tumbled in, now dragging back, falling to\nthe ground, rising, and falling again. And all the while he hissed but\nspoke no words.\nThe fires below awoke in anger, the red light blazed, and all the\ncavern was filled with a great glare and heat. Suddenly Sam saw\nGollum\u2019s long hands draw upwards to his mouth; his white fangs\ngleamed, and then snapped as they bit. Frodo gave a cry, and there\nhe was, fallen upon his knees at the chasm\u2019s edge. But Gollum,\ndancing like a mad thing, held aloft the ring, a finger still thrust\nwithin its circle. It shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire.\n\u2018Precious, precious, precious!\u2019 Gollum cried. \u2018My Precious!

And there upon the dark threshold of the Sam-\nmath Naur, high above the plains of Mordor, such wonder and terror\ncame on him that he stood still forgetting all else, and gazed as one\nturned to stone.\nA brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it\ntowers and battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty moun-\ntain-throne above immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons,\neyeless prisons sheer as cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant:\nand then all passed. Towers fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled\nand melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke and spouting steams\nwent billowing up, up, until they toppled like an overwhelming wave,\nand its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land.\nAnd then at last over the miles between there came a rumble, rising\nto a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the plain heaved and\ncracked, and Orodruin reeled. Fire belched from its riven summit.\nThe skies burst into thunder seared with lightning. Down like lashing\nwhips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm,\nwith a cry that pierced all other sounds, tearing the clouds asunder,\nthe Nazgu\u02c6 l came, shooting like flaming bolts, as caught in the fiery\nruin of hill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out.\n\u2018Well, this is the end, Sam Gamgee,\u2019 said a voice by his side. And\nthere was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his\neyes there was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor\nany fear. His burden was taken away. There was the dear master of\nthe sweet days in the Shire.\n\u2018Master!\u2019 cried Sam, and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin of\nthe world for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. The burden was\ngone. His master had been saved; he was himself again, he was free.\nAnd then Sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand.\n\u2018Your poor hand!\u2019 he said. \u2018And I have nothing to bind it with, or\ncomfort it. I would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather.\nBut he\u2019s gone now beyond recall, gone for ever.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But do you remember Gandalf \u2019s words: Even\nGollum may have something yet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not\nhave destroyed the Ring. The Quest would have been in vain, even\nat the bitter end. So let us forgive him! For the Quest is achieved,\nand now all is over.

{"972": "Chapter 4\nTHE FIELD OF CORMALLEN\nAll about the hills the hosts of Mordor raged. The Captains of the\nWest were foundering in a gathering sea. The sun gleamed red, and\nunder the wings of the Nazgu\u02c6 l the shadows of death fell dark upon\nthe earth. Aragorn stood beneath his banner, silent and stern, as one\nlost in thought of things long past or far away; but his eyes gleamed\nlike stars that shine the brighter as the night deepens. Upon the\nhill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow\nfell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on the\nbeleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash\nof arms.\nAs if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf\nstirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale\nand clear. Then he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice\nringing above the din: The Eagles are coming! And many voices\nanswered crying: The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming! The\nhosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what this sign might mean.\nThere came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother,\ngreatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants\nof old Thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of\nthe Encircling Mountains when Middle-earth was young. Behind\nthem in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern\nmountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight down upon the\nNazgu\u02c6l they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and the\nrush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale.\nBut the Nazgu\u02c6l turned and fled, and vanished into Mordor\u2019s\nshadows, hearing a sudden terrible call out of the Dark Tower; and\neven at that moment all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched\ntheir hearts, their laughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs\nwere loosed. The Power that drove them on and filled them with\nhate and fury was wavering, its will was removed from them; and\nnow looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a deadly light and\nwere afraid.\nThen all the Captains of the West cried aloud, for their hearts\nwere filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness.

The Towers of the\nTeeth swayed, tottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart crumbled;\nthe Black Gate was hurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim,\nnow growing, now mounting to the clouds, there came a drumming\nrumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous noise.\n\u2018The realm of Sauron is ended!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The Ring-bearer\nhas fulfilled his Quest.\u2019 And as the Captains gazed south to the Land\nof Mordor, it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud,\nthere rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned,\nfilling all the sky. Enormous it reared above the world, and stretched\nout towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible but impotent: for\neven as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown\naway, and passed; and then a hush fell.\nThe Captains bowed their heads; and when they looked up again,\nbehold! their enemies were flying and the power of Mordor was\nscattering like dust in the wind. As when death smites the swollen\nbrooding thing that inhabits their crawling hill and holds them all in\nsway, ants will wander witless and purposeless and then feebly die,\nso the creatures of Sauron, orc or troll or beast spell-enslaved, ran\nhither and thither mindless; and some slew themselves, or cast them-\nselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless\nplaces far from hope. But the Men of Rhu\u02c6n and of Harad, Easterling\nand Southron, saw the ruin of their war and the great majesty and\nglory of the Captains of the West. And those that were deepest and\nlongest in evil servitude, hating the West, and yet were men proud\nand bold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of\ndesperate battle. But the most part fled eastward as they could; and\nsome cast their weapons down and sued for mercy.\nThen Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to\nAragorn and the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and\ndown to him came the great eagle, Gwaihir the Windlord, and stood\nbefore him.\n\u2018Twice you have borne me, Gwaihir my friend,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Thrice shall pay for all, if you are willing.

Their last strength of mind\nand body was swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen hill piled\nat the Mountain\u2019s foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was\nan island now, not long to endure, amid the torment of Orodruin.\nAll about it the earth gaped, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and\nfumes leaped up. Behind them the Mountain was convulsed. Great\nrents opened in its side. Slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes\ntowards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A rain of hot ash was\nfalling.\nThey stood now; and Sam still holding his master\u2019s hand caressed\nit. He sighed. \u2018What a tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven\u2019t we?\u2019\nhe said. \u2018I wish I could hear it told! Do you think they\u2019ll say: Now\ncomes the story of Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom?

And\nthen one blew a long trumpet, and they went on through the aisle\nof trees beside the singing stream.

And behold!\nhe said:\n\u2018Lo! lords and knights and men of valour unashamed, kings and\nprinces, and fair people of Gondor, and Riders of Rohan, and ye\nsons of Elrond, and Du\u00b4nedain of the North, and Elf and Dwarf, and\ngreathearts of the Shire, and all free folk of the West, now listen to\nmy lay. For I will sing to you of Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the\nRing of Doom.\u2019\nAnd when Sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight, and\nhe stood up and cried: \u2018O great glory and splendour! And all my\nwishes have come true!\u2019 And then he wept.\nAnd all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their\nmerriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver\nand gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them, now in\nthe elven-tongue, now in the speech of the West, until their hearts,\nwounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords,\nand they passed in thought out to regions where pain and delight\nflow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness.\nAnd at the last, as the Sun fell from the noon and the shadows of\nthe trees lengthened, he ended. \u2018Praise them with great praise!\u2019 he\nsaid and knelt. And then Aragorn stood up, and all the host arose,\nand they passed to pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make\nmerry while the day lasted.\nFrodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there\ntheir old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour;\nand clean linen was given to them. Then Gandalf came and in his\narms, to the wonder of Frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak\nand the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in Mordor.

{"979": "\u2018Tonight at least you should wear one,\u2019 said Gandalf.\nThen Frodo took the small sword that had belonged to Sam, and\nhad been laid at his side in Cirith Ungol. \u2018Sting I gave to you Sam,\u2019\nhe said.\n\u2018No, master! Mr. Bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver\ncoat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.\u2019\nFrodo gave way; and Gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt\nand girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets\nof silver upon their heads. And when they were arrayed they went\nto the great feast; and they sat at the King\u2019s table with Gandalf,\nand King E\u00b4omer of Rohan, and the Prince Imrahil and all the chief\ncaptains; and there also were Gimli and Legolas.\nBut when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came\nin two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was\nclad in the silver and sable of the Guards of Minas Tirith, and the\nother in white and green. But Sam wondered what such young boys\nwere doing in an army of mighty men. Then suddenly as they drew\nnear and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:\n\u2018Why, look Mr. Frodo! Look here! Well, if it isn\u2019t Pippin. Mr.\nPeregrin Took I should say, and Mr. Merry! How they have grown!\nBless me! But I can see there\u2019s more tales to tell than ours.\u2019\n\u2018There are indeed,\u2019 said Pippin turning towards him. \u2018And we\u2019ll\nbegin telling them, as soon as this feast is ended. In the meantime\nyou can try Gandalf. He\u2019s not so close as he used to be, though he\nlaughs now more than he talks. For the present Merry and I are busy.\nWe are knights of the City and of the Mark, as I hope you observe.\u2019\nAt last the glad day ended; and when the Sun was gone and the\nround Moon rode slowly above the mists of Anduin and flickered\nthrough the fluttering leaves, Frodo and Sam sat under the whispering\ntrees amid the fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into\nthe night with Merry and Pippin and Gandalf, and after a while\nLegolas and Gimli joined them. There Frodo and Sam learned much\nof all that had happened to the Company after their fellowship was\nbroken on the evil day at Parth Galen by Rauros Falls; and still there\nwas always more to ask and more to tell.\nOrcs, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping riders,\nand glittering caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles,\nand tall ships sailing, all these passed before Sam\u2019s mind until he felt\nbewildered. But amidst all these wonders he returned always to his\nastonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them\nstand back to back with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head."}

Why, it will take weeks before we get all\nthese things sized up!\u2019\n\u2018Weeks indeed,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018And then Frodo will have to be\nlocked up in a tower in Minas Tirith and write it all down. Otherwise\nhe will forget half of it, and poor old Bilbo will be dreadfully dis-\nappointed.\u2019\nAt length Gandalf rose. \u2018The hands of the King are hands of\nhealing, dear friends,\u2019 he said. \u2018But you went to the very brink of\ndeath ere he recalled you, putting forth all his power, and sent you\ninto the sweet forgetfulness of sleep.

But for Gimli the Dwarf you would have been lost\nthen. But at least I know now the look of a hobbit\u2019s foot, though it\nbe all that can be seen under a heap of bodies. And when I heaved\nthat great carcase off you, I made sure you were dead. I could have\ntorn out my beard. And it is only a day yet since you were first up\nand abroad again. To bed now you go. And so shall I.\u2019\n\u2018And I,\u2019 said Legolas, \u2018shall walk in the woods of this fair land,\nwhich is rest enough.

{"981": "And so singing Legolas went away down the hill.\nThen the others also departed, and Frodo and Sam went to their\nbeds and slept. And in the morning they rose again in hope and\npeace; and they spent many days in Ithilien.

And when he learned that at the siege of Gondor there\nhad been a great number of these beasts but that they were all\ndestroyed, he thought it a sad loss.\n\u2018Well, one can\u2019t be everywhere at once, I suppose,\u2019 he said. \u2018But\nI missed a lot, seemingly.\u2019\nIn the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to Minas\nTirith. The weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had\nlaboured and fought much with the remnants of the Easterlings and\nSouthrons, until all were subdued. And, latest of all, those returned\nwho had passed into Mordor and destroyed the fortresses in the north\nof the land.\nBut at the last when the month of May was drawing near the\nCaptains of the West set out again; and they went aboard ship with\nall their men, and they sailed from Cair Andros down Anduin to\nOsgiliath; and there they remained for one day; and the day after\nthey came to the green fields of the Pelennor and saw again the white\ntowers under tall Mindolluin, the City of the Men of Gondor, last\nmemory of Westernesse, that had passed through the darkness and\nfire to a new day.\nAnd there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and\nawaited the morning; for it was the Eve of May, and the King would\nenter his gates with the rising of the Sun."}
{"982": "Chapter 5\nTHE STEWARD AND THE KING\nOver the city of Gondor doubt and great dread had hung. Fair\nweather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days\nheld little hope, and who looked each morning for news of doom.\nTheir lord was dead and burned, dead lay the King of Rohan in their\ncitadel, and the new king that had come to them in the night was\ngone again to a war with powers too dark and terrible for any might\nor valour to conquer. And no news came. After the host left Morgul\nVale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the moun-\ntains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what was passing\nin the brooding East.\nWhen the Captains were but two days gone, the Lady E\u00b4owyn bade\nthe women who tended her to bring her raiment, and she would not\nbe gainsaid, but rose; and when they had clothed her and set her\narm in a sling of linen, she went to the Warden of the Houses of\nHealing.\n\u2018Sir,\u2019 she said, \u2018I am in great unrest, and I cannot lie longer in\nsloth.\u2019\n\u2018Lady,\u2019 he answered, \u2018you are not yet healed, and I was com-\nmanded to tend you with especial care. You should not have risen\nfrom your bed for seven days yet, or so I was bidden. I beg you to\ngo back.\u2019\n\u2018I am healed,\u2019 she said, \u2018healed at least in body, save my left arm\nonly, and that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught\nthat I can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell me\nnothing.\u2019\n\u2018There are no tidings,\u2019 said the Warden, \u2018save that the Lords have\nridden to Morgul Vale; and men say that the new captain out of the\nNorth is their chief. A great lord is that, and a healer; and it is a\nthing passing strange to me that the healing hand should also wield\nthe sword. It is not thus in Gondor now, though once it was so, if\nold tales be true. But for long years we healers have only sought to\npatch the rents made by the men of swords. Though we should still\nhave enough to do without them: the world is full enough of hurts\nand mischances without wars to multiply them.\u2019\n\u2018It needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, Master Warden,\u2019\nansweredE\u00b4 owyn.\u2018Andthosewhohavenotswordscanstilldieupon"}

Tall she stood there, her eyes bright\nin her white face, her right hand clenched as she turned and gazed\nout of his window that opened to the East. He sighed and shook his\nhead. After a pause she turned to him again.\n\u2018Is there no deed to do?\u2019 she said. \u2018Who commands in this City?\u2019\n\u2018I do not rightly know,\u2019 he answered. \u2018Such things are not my care.\nThere is a marshal over the Riders of Rohan; and the Lord Hu\u00b4rin,\nI am told, commands the men of Gondor. But the Lord Faramir is\nby right the Steward of the City.\u2019\n\u2018Where can I find him?\u2019\n\u2018In this house, lady. He was sorely hurt, but is now set again on\nthe way to health. But I do not know\u2014\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Will you not bring me to him? Then you will know.\u2019\nThe Lord Faramir was walking alone in the garden of the Houses\nof Healing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new\nin his veins; but his heart was heavy, and he looked out over the\nwalls eastward. And coming, the Warden spoke his name, and he\nturned and saw the Lady E\u00b4 owyn of Rohan; and he was moved with\npity, for he saw that she was hurt, and his clear sight perceived her\nsorrow and unrest.\n\u2018My lord,\u2019 said the Warden, \u2018here is the Lady E\u00b4owyn of Rohan.\nShe rode with the king and was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my\nkeeping. But she is not content, and she wishes to speak to the\nSteward of the City.\u2019\n\u2018Do not misunderstand him, lord,\u2019 said E\u00b4 owyn. \u2018It is not lack of\ncare that grieves me. No houses could be fairer, for those who desire\nto be healed. But I cannot lie in sloth, idle, caged. I looked for death\nin battle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on.\u2019\nAt a sign from Faramir, the Warden bowed and departed. \u2018What\nwould you have me do, lady?\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018I also am a prisoner of\nthe healers.\u2019 He looked at her, and being a man whom pity deeply\nstirred, it seemed to him that her loveliness amid her grief would\npierce his heart. And she looked at him and saw the grave tenderness\nin his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred among men of war, that\nhere was one whom no Rider of the Mark would outmatch in battle.\n\u2018What do you wish?\u2019 he said again. \u2018If it lies in my power, I will\ndo it.\u2019\n\u2018I would have you command this Warden, and bid him let me go,\u2019\nshe said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered,"}

But had I done so, I\nshould still listen to his counsel, and should not cross his will in\nmatters of his craft, unless in some great need.\u2019\n\u2018But I do not desire healing,\u2019 she said. \u2018I wish to ride to war like\nmy brother E\u00b4omer, or better like The\u00b4oden the king, for he died and\nhas both honour and peace.\u2019\n\u2018It is too late, lady, to follow the Captains, even if you had the\nstrength,\u2019 said Faramir. \u2018But death in battle may come to us all yet,\nwilling or unwilling. You will be better prepared to face it in your\nown manner, if while there is still time you do as the Healer com-\nmanded. You and I, we must endure with patience the hours of\nwaiting.\u2019\nShe did not answer, but as he looked at her it seemed to him that\nsomething in her softened, as though a bitter frost were yielding at\nthe first faint presage of spring. A tear sprang in her eye and fell\ndown her cheek, like a glistening rain-drop. Her proud head drooped\na little. Then quietly, more as if speaking to herself than to him: \u2018But\nthe healers would have me lie abed seven days yet,\u2019 she said. \u2018And\nmy window does not look eastward.\u2019 Her voice was now that of a\nmaiden young and sad.\nFaramir smiled, though his heart was filled with pity. \u2018Your\nwindow does not look eastward?\u2019 he said. \u2018That can be amended. In\nthis I will command the Warden. If you will stay in this house in our\ncare, lady, and take your rest, then you shall walk in this garden in\nthe sun, as you will; and you shall look east, whither all our hopes\nhave gone. And here you will find me, walking and waiting, and also\nlooking east. It would ease my care, if you would speak to me, or\nwalk at whiles with me.\u2019\nThen she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again; and\na colour came in her pale face. \u2018How should I ease your care, my\nlord?\u2019 she said. \u2018And I do not desire the speech of living men.\u2019\n\u2018Would you have my plain answer?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018I would.\u2019\n\u2018Then, E\u00b4 owyn of Rohan, I say to you that you are beautiful. In\nthe valleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright, and maidens\nfairer still; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in Gondor\nso lovely, and so sorrowful.

But Faramir for\na long while walked alone in the garden, and his glance now strayed\nrather to the house than to the eastward walls.\nWhen he returned to his chamber he called for the Warden, and\nheard all that he could tell of the Lady of Rohan.\n\u2018But I doubt not, lord,\u2019 said the Warden, \u2018that you would learn\nmore from the Halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of\nthe king, and with the Lady at the end, they say.\u2019\nAnd so Merry was sent to Faramir, and while that day lasted they\ntalked long together, and Faramir learned much, more even than\nMerry put into words; and he thought that he understood now some-\nthing of the grief and unrest of E\u00b4owyn of Rohan. And in the fair\nevening Faramir and Merry walked in the garden, but she did not\ncome.\nBut in the morning, as Faramir came from the Houses, he saw\nher, as she stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and\ngleamed in the sun. And he called to her, and she came down, and\nthey walked on the grass or sat under a green tree together, now in\nsilence, now in speech. And each day after they did likewise. And\nthe Warden looking from his window was glad in heart, for he was\na healer, and his care was lightened; and certain it was that, heavy\nas was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of men,\nstill these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength.\nAnd so the fifth day came since the Lady E\u00b4owyn went first to\nFaramir; and they stood now together once more upon the walls of\nthe City and looked out. No tidings had yet come, and all hearts\nwere darkened. The weather, too, was bright no longer.

But now\nI will put Queen Arwen Evenstar first, and I am ready to do battle\non my own part with any who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?\u2019\nThen Gimli bowed low. \u2018Nay, you are excused for my part, lord,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the\nMorning. And my heart forebodes that soon it will pass away for\never.\u2019\nAt last the day of departure came, and a great and fair company\nmade ready to ride north from the City. Then the kings of Gondor\nand Rohan went to the Hallows and they came to the tombs in Rath\nD\u00b4\u0131nen, and they bore away King The\u00b4oden upon a golden bier, and\npassed through the City in silence. Then they laid the bier upon a\ngreat wain with Riders of Rohan all about it and his banner borne\nbefore; and Merry being The\u00b4oden\u2019s esquire rode upon the wain and\nkept the arms of the king.\nFor the other Companions steeds were furnished according to"}
{"1000": "Gondor; and Legolas and Gimli as ever rode together upon Arod.\nIn that riding went also Queen Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel\nwith their folk, and Elrond and his sons; and the princes of Dol\nAmroth and of Ithilien, and many captains and knights. Never had\nany king of the Mark such company upon the road as went with\nThe\u00b4oden Thengel\u2019s son to the land of his home.\nWithout haste and at peace they passed into Ano\u00b4 rien, and they\ncame to the Grey Wood under Amon D\u02c6\u0131n; and there they heard a\nsound as of drums beating in the hills, though no living thing could\nbe seen. Then Aragorn let the trumpets be blown; and heralds cried:\n\u2018Behold, the King Elessar is come! The Forest of Dru\u00b4adan he gives\nto Gha\u02c6n-buri-Gha\u02c6n and to his folk, to be their own for ever; and\nhereafter let no man enter it without their leave!\u2019\nThen the drums rolled loudly, and were silent.\nAt length after fifteen days of journey the wain of King The\u00b4oden\npassed through the green fields of Rohan and came to Edoras; and\nthere they all rested. The Golden Hall was arrayed with fair hangings\nand it was filled with light, and there was held the highest feast that\nit had known since the days of its building. For after three days the\nMen of the Mark prepared the funeral of The\u00b4oden; and he was laid\nin a house of stone with his arms and many other fair things that he\nhad possessed, and over him was raised a great mound, covered with\ngreen turves of grass and of white evermind. And now there were\neight mounds on the east-side of the Barrowfield.\nThen the Riders of the King\u2019s House upon white horses rode round\nabout the barrow and sang together a song of The\u00b4oden Thengel\u2019s son\nthat Gle\u00b4owine his minstrel made, and he made no other song after.\nThe slow voices of the Riders stirred the hearts even of those who\ndid not know the speech of that people; but the words of the song\nbrought a light to the eyes of the folk of the Mark as they heard again\nafar the thunder of the hooves of the North and the voice of Eorl\ncrying above the battle upon the Field of Celebrant; and the tale of\nthe kings rolled on, and the horn of Helm was loud in the mountains,\nuntil the Darkness came and King The\u00b4oden arose and rode through\nthe Shadow to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the Sun,\nreturning beyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning.\nOut of doubt, out of dark, to the day\u2019s rising\nhe rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.\nHope he rekindled, and in hope ended;\nover death, over dread, over doom lifted"}
{"1001": "But Merry stood at the foot of the green mound, and he wept,\nand when the song was ended he arose and cried:\n\u2018The\u00b4oden King, The\u00b4oden King! Farewell! As a father you were to\nme, for a little while. Farewell!\u2019\nWhen the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled,\nand The\u00b4oden was left at last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered\nto the Golden Hall for the great feast and put away sorrow; for\nThe\u00b4oden had lived to full years and ended in honour no less than\nthe greatest of his sires. And when the time came that in the custom\nof the Mark they should drink to the memory of the kings, E\u00b4owyn\nLady of Rohan came forth, golden as the sun and white as snow,\nand she bore a filled cup to E\u00b4 omer.\nThen a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all the names\nof the Lords of the Mark in their order: Eorl the Young; and Brego\nbuilder of the Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless; and\nFre\u00b4a, and Fre\u00b4awine, and Goldwine, and De\u00b4or, and Gram; and Helm\nwho lay hid in Helm\u2019s Deep when the Mark was overrun; and so\nended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that time the line was\nbroken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: Fre\u00b4ala\u00b4f, Helm\u2019s\nsister-son, and Le\u00b4ofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and\nFengel, and Thengel, and The\u00b4oden the latest. And when The\u00b4oden\nwas named E\u00b4omer drained the cup. Then E\u00b4owyn bade those that\nserved to fill the cups, and all there assembled rose and drank to the\nnew king, crying: \u2018Hail, E\u00b4 omer, King of the Mark!\u2019\nAt the last when the feast drew to an end E\u00b4omer arose and said: \u2018Now\nthis is the funeral feast of The\u00b4oden the King; but I will speak ere we go\nof tidings of joy, for he would not grudge that I should do so, since he\nwas ever a father to E\u00b4owyn my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk\nof many realms, such as have never before been gathered in this hall!\nFaramir, Steward of Gondor, and Prince of Ithilien, asks that E\u00b4 owyn\nLady of Rohan should be his wife, and she grants it full willing.\nTherefore they shall be trothplighted before you all.\u2019\nAnd Faramir and E\u00b4 owyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and\nall there drank to them and were glad. \u2018Thus,\u2019 said E\u00b4 omer, \u2018is the\nfriendship of the Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and\nthe more do I rejoice.\u2019\n\u2018No niggard are you, E\u00b4 omer,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018to give thus to Gondor\nthe fairest thing in your realm!\u2019\nThen E\u00b4 owyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: \u2018Wish\nme joy, my liege-lord and healer!\u2019\nAnd he answered: \u2018I have wished thee joy ever since first I saw"}
{"1002": "When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King\nE\u00b4 omer. Aragorn and his knights, and the people of Lo\u00b4rien and of\nRivendell, made ready to ride; but Faramir and Imrahil remained at\nEdoras; and Arwen Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to\nher brethren. None saw her last meeting with Elrond her father,\nfor they went up into the hills and there spoke long together, and\nbitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the\nworld.\nAt the last before the guests set out E\u00b4omer and E\u00b4 owyn came to\nMerry, and they said: \u2018Farewell now, Meriadoc of the Shire and\nHoldwine of the Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to\nour welcome!\u2019\nAnd E\u00b4 omer said: \u2018Kings of old would have laden you with gifts\nthat a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mund-\nburg; and yet you will take naught, you say, but the arms that were\ngiven to you. This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy;\nbut my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of\nDernhelm and of the horns of the Mark at the coming of the morning.\u2019\nThen E\u00b4 owyn gave to Merry an ancient horn, small but cunningly\nwrought all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had\nengraven upon it swift horsemen riding in a line that wound about\nit from the tip to the mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue.\n\u2018This is an heirloom of our house,\u2019 said E\u00b4owyn. \u2018It was made by\nthe Dwarves, and came from the hoard of Scatha the Worm. Eorl\nthe Young brought it from the North. He that blows it at need shall\nset fear in the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends,\nand they shall hear him and come to him.\u2019\nThen Merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he\nkissed E\u00b4owyn\u2019s hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted\nfor that time.\nNow the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and\nwith great praise and friendship they departed, and came at length\nto Helm\u2019s Deep, and there they rested two days. Then Legolas repaid\nhis promise to Gimli and went with him to the Glittering Caves; and\nwhen they returned he was silent, and would say only that Gimli\nalone could find fit words to speak of them. \u2018And never before has\na Dwarf claimed a victory over an Elf in a contest of words,\u2019 said he.\n\u2018Now therefore let us go to Fangorn and set the score right!\u2019\nFrom Deeping-coomb they rode to Isengard, and saw how the\nEnts had busied themselves. All the stone-circle had been thrown\ndown and removed, and the land within was made into a garden"}
{"1003": "Tower of Orthanc rose still, tall and impregnable, and its black rock\nwas mirrored in the pool.\nFor a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of Isengard\nhad stood, and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the\nbeginning of a green-bordered path that ran towards Orthanc; and\nthey looked in wonder at the work that had been done, but no living\nthing could they see far or near. But presently they heard a voice\ncalling hoom-hom, hoom-hom; and there came Treebeard striding\ndown the path to greet them with Quickbeam at his side.\n\u2018Welcome to the Treegarth of Orthanc!\u2019 he said. \u2018I knew that you\nwere coming, but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to\nbe done. But you have not been idle either away in the south and\nthe east, I hear; and all that I hear is good, very good.\u2019 Then Tree-\nbeard praised all their deeds, of which he seemed to have full know-\nledge; and at last he stopped and looked long at Gandalf.\n\u2018Well, come now!\u2019 he said. \u2018You have proved mightiest, and all\nyour labours have gone well. Where now would you be going? And\nwhy do you come here?\u2019\n\u2018To see how your work goes, my friend,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018and to\nthank you for your aid in all that has been achieved.\u2019\n\u2018Hoom, well, that is fair enough,\u2019 said Treebeard; \u2018for to be sure\nEnts have played their part. And not only in dealing with that, hoom,\nthat accursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great in-\nrush of those, bura\u00b4rum, those evileyed-blackhanded-bowlegged-flint-\nhearted-clawfingered-foulbellied-bloodthirsty, morimaite-sincahonda,\nhoom, well, since you are hasty folk and their full name is as long as\nyears of torment, those vermin of orcs; and they came over the River\nand down from the North and all round the wood of Laurelindo\u00b4renan,\nwhich they could not get into, thanks to the Great ones who are\nhere.\u2019 He bowed to the Lord and Lady of Lo\u00b4 rien.\n\u2018And these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet\nus out on the Wold, for they had not heard of us before; though that\nmight be said also of better folk. And not many will remember us,\nfor not many escaped us alive, and the River had most of those. But\nit was well for you, for if they had not met us, then the king of the\ngrassland would not have ridden far, and if he had there would have\nbeen no home to return to.\u2019\n\u2018We know it well,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018and never shall it be forgotten\nin Minas Tirith or in Edoras.\u2019\n\u2018Never is too long a word even for me,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018Not while\nyour kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed\nto seem long to Ents.\u2019"}
{"1004": "But now come tell me: what of the task that I set you? How is\nSaruman? Is he not weary of Orthanc yet? For I do not suppose that\nhe will think you have improved the view from his windows.\u2019\nTreebeard gave Gandalf a long look, almost a cunning look, Merry\nthought. \u2018Ah!\u2019 he said. \u2018I thought you would come to that. Weary of\nOrthanc? Very weary at last; but not so weary of his tower as he was\nweary of my voice. Hoom! I gave him some long tales, or at least\nwhat might be thought long in your speech.\u2019\n\u2018Then why did he stay to listen? Did you go into Orthanc?\u2019 asked\nGandalf.\n\u2018Hoom, no, not into Orthanc!\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018But he came to\nhis window and listened, because he could not get news in any other\nway, and though he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and I\nsaw that he heard it all. But I added a great many things to the news\nthat it was good for him to think of. He grew very weary. He always\nwas hasty. That was his ruin.\u2019\n\u2018I observe, my good Fangorn,\u2019 said Gandalf, \u2018that with great care\nyou say dwelt, was, grew. What about is? Is he dead?\u2019\n\u2018No, not dead, so far as I know,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018But he is gone.\nYes, he is gone seven days. I let him go. There was little left of him\nwhen he crawled out, and as for that worm-creature of his, he was\nlike a pale shadow. Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to\nkeep him safe; for I know it. But things have changed since then.\nAnd I kept him until he was safe, safe from doing any more harm.\nYou should know that above all I hate the caging of live things, and\nI will not keep even such creatures as these caged beyond great need.\nA snake without fangs may crawl where he will.\u2019\n\u2018You may be right,\u2019 said Gandalf; \u2018but this snake had still one\ntooth left, I think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that\nhe persuaded you, even you Treebeard, knowing the soft spot in your\nheart. Well, he is gone, and there is no more to be said. But the\nTower of Orthanc now goes back to the King, to whom it belongs.\nThough maybe he will not need it.\u2019\n\u2018That will be seen later,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018But I will give to Ents all\nthis valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon\nOrthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.\u2019\n\u2018It is locked,\u2019 said Treebeard. \u2018I made Saruman lock it and give\nme the keys. Quickbeam has them.\u2019\nQuickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to\nAragorn two great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a ring of\nsteel. \u2018Now I thank you once more,\u2019 said Aragorn, \u2018and I bid you\nfarewell. May your forest grow again in peace. When this valley is"}
{"1005": "Treebeard\u2019s face became sad. \u2018Forests may grow,\u2019 he said. \u2018Woods\nmay spread. But not Ents. There are no Entings.\u2019\n\u2018Yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,\u2019 said Aragorn.\n\u2018Lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.\u2019\nBut Treebeard shook his head and said: \u2018It is far to go. And there\nare too many Men there in these days. But I am forgetting my\nmanners! Will you stay here and rest a while? And maybe there are\nsome that would be pleased to pass through Fangorn Forest and so\nshorten their road home?\u2019 He looked at Celeborn and Galadriel.\nBut all save Legolas said that they must now take their leave and\ndepart either south or west. \u2018Come, Gimli!\u2019 said Legolas. \u2018Now by\nFangorn\u2019s leave I will visit the deep places of the Entwood and see\nsuch trees as are nowhere else to be found in Middle-earth. You shall\ncome with me and keep your word; and thus we will journey on\ntogether to our own lands in Mirkwood and beyond.\u2019 To this Gimli\nagreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.\n\u2018Here then at last comes the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring,\u2019\nsaid Aragorn. \u2018Yet I hope that ere long you will return to my land\nwith the help that you promised.\u2019\n\u2018We will come, if our own lords allow it,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018Well, fare-\nwell, my hobbits! You should come safe to your own homes now,\nand I shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril. We will send\nword when we may, and some of us may yet meet at times; but I\nfear that we shall not all be gathered together ever again.\u2019\nThen Treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed\nthree times slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and Galad-\nriel. \u2018It is long, long since we met by stock or by stone, A vanimar,\nvanima\u00b4lion nostari!\u2019 he said. \u2018It is sad that we should meet only thus at\nthe ending. For the world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in\nthe earth, and I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.\u2019\nAnd Celeborn said: \u2018I do not know, Eldest.\u2019 But Galadriel said:\n\u2018Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are\nlifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet\nin the Spring. Farewell!\u2019\nLast of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the old Ent, and\nhe grew gayer as he looked at them. \u2018Well, my merry folk,\u2019 he said,\n\u2018will you drink another draught with me before you go?\u2019\n\u2018Indeed we will,\u2019 they said, and he took them aside into the shade\nof one of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been\nset.

The Hobbits were grieved at this parting; for Aragorn had\nnever failed them and he had been their guide through many perils.\n\u2018I wish we could have a Stone that we could see all our friends\nin,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018and that we could speak to them from far away!\u2019\n\u2018Only one now remains that you could use,\u2019 answered Aragorn;\n\u2018for you would not wish to see what the Stone of Minas Tirith would\nshow you. But the Palant\u00b4\u0131r of Orthanc the King will keep, to see\nwhat is passing in his realm, and what his servants are doing.

The\nDunlendings fled and hid themselves, for they were afraid of Elvish\nfolk, though few indeed ever came to their country; but the travellers\ndid not heed them, for they were still a great company and were well\nprovided with all that they needed; and they went on their way at\ntheir leisure, setting up their tents when they would.\nOn thesixth daysince theirparting from theKing theyjourneyed"}

Long may your land be short of leaf !\u2019\n\u2018Thank you!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018In that case I will have my pouch back,\nwhich is not yours and has journeyed far with me. Wrap the weed\nin a rag of your own.\u2019\n\u2018One thief deserves another,\u2019 said Saruman, and turned his back\non Merry, and kicked Wormtongue, and went away towards the\nwood.\n\u2018Well, I like that!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Thief indeed! What of our claim\nfor waylaying, wounding, and orc-dragging us through Rohan?\u2019\n\u2018Ah!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And bought he said. How, I wonder? And I didn\u2019t\nlike the sound of what he said about the Southfarthing. It\u2019s time we\ngot back.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m sure it is,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But we can\u2019t go any quicker, if we are\nto see Bilbo. I am going to Rivendell first, whatever happens.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I think you had better do that,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018But alas for\nSaruman! I fear nothing more can be made of him. He has withered\naltogether. All the same, I am not sure that Treebeard is right: I\nfancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way.\u2019\nNext day they went on into northern Dunland, where no men\nnow dwelt, though it was a green and pleasant country. September\ncame in with golden days and silver nights, and they rode at ease\nuntil they reached the Swanfleet river, and found the old ford, east of\nthefallswhereitwentdownsuddenlyintothelowlands.Fartothewest"}
{"1009": "So they passed into Eregion, and at last a fair morning dawned,\nshimmering above gleaming mists; and looking from their camp\non a low hill the travellers saw away in the east the Sun catching\nthree peaks that thrust up into the sky through floating clouds:\nCaradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol. They were near to the Gates of\nMoria.\nHere now for seven days they tarried, for the time was at hand\nfor another parting which they were loth to make. Soon Celeborn\nand Galadriel and their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the\nRedhorn Gate and down the Dimrill Stair to the Silverlode and to\ntheir own country. They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways,\nfor they had much to speak of with Elrond and with Gandalf, and\nhere they lingered still in converse with their friends. Often long after\nthe hobbits were wrapped in sleep they would sit together under the\nstars, recalling the ages that were gone and all their joys and labours\nin the world, or holding council, concerning the days to come. If any\nwanderer had chanced to pass, little would he have seen or heard,\nand it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures, carved\nin stone, memorials of forgotten things now lost in unpeopled lands.\nFor they did not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind to\nmind; and only their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts\nwent to and fro.\nBut at length all was said, and they parted again for a while, until\nit was time for the Three Rings to pass away. Quickly fading into the\nstones and the shadows the grey-cloaked people of Lo\u00b4rien rode\ntowards the mountains; and those who were going to Rivendell sat\non the hill and watched, until there came out of the gathering mist\na flash; and then they saw no more. Frodo knew that Galadriel had\nheld aloft her ring in token of farewell.\nSam turned away and sighed: \u2018I wish I was going back to Lo\u00b4 rien!\u2019\nAt last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as\nto travellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of\nRivendell and saw far below the lamps shining in Elrond\u2019s house.\nAnd they went down and crossed the bridge and came to the doors,\nand all the house was filled with light and song for joy at Elrond\u2019s\nhomecoming.\nFirst of all, before they had eaten or washed or even shed their\ncloaks, the hobbits went in search of Bilbo. They found him all alone\nin his little room. It was littered with papers and pens and pencils;\nbut Bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small bright fire. He looked\nvery old, but peaceful, and sleepy.\nHeopenedhiseyesandlookedupastheycamein.\u2018Hullo,hullo!\u2019"}
{"1010": "twenty-nine? And in one year more, if I am spared, I shall equal the\nOld Took. I should like to beat him; but we shall see.\u2019\nAfter the celebration of Bilbo\u2019s birthday the four hobbits stayed\nin Rivendell for some days, and they sat much with their old friend,\nwho spent most of his time now in his room, except at meals. For\nthese he was still very punctual as a rule, and he seldom failed to\nwake up in time for them. Sitting round the fire they told him in\nturn all that they could remember of their journeys and adventures.\nAt first he pretended to take some notes; but he often fell asleep;\nand when he woke he would say: \u2018How splendid! How wonderful!\nBut where were we?\u2019 Then they went on with the story from the\npoint where he had begun to nod.\nThe only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his atten-\ntion was the account of the crowning and marriage of Aragorn. \u2018I\nwas invited to the wedding, of course,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I have waited\nfor it long enough. But somehow, when it came to it, I found I had\nso much to do here; and packing is such a bother.\u2019\nWhen nearly a fortnight had passed Frodo looked out of his\nwindow and saw that there had been a frost in the night, and the\ncobwebs were like white nets. Then suddenly he knew that he must\ngo, and say good-bye to Bilbo. The weather was still calm and fair,\nafter one of the most lovely summers that people could remember;\nbut October had come, and it must break soon and begin to rain\nand blow again. And there was still a very long way to go. Yet it was\nnot really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He had a\nfeeling that it was time he went back to the Shire. Sam shared it.\nOnly the night before he had said:\n\u2018Well, Mr. Frodo, we\u2019ve been far and seen a deal, and yet I don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019ve found a better place than this. There\u2019s something of\neverything here, if you understand me: the Shire and the Golden\nWood and Gondor and kings\u2019 houses and inns and meadows and\nmountains all mixed. And yet, somehow, I feel we ought to be going\nsoon. I\u2019m worried about my gaffer, to tell you the truth.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, something of everything, Sam, except the Sea,\u2019 Frodo had\nanswered; and he repeated it now to himself: \u2018Except the Sea.\u2019\nThat day Frodo spoke to Elrond, and it was agreed that they\nshould leave the next morning. To their delight Gandalf said: \u2018I think\nI shall come too. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.\u2019\nIn the evening they went to say good-bye to Bilbo. \u2018Well, if you\nmust go, you must,\u2019 he said. \u2018I am sorry. I shall miss you. It is nice"}
{"1011": "that he had already done so; and he gave him also three books of\nlore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand,\nand labelled on their red backs: Translations from the Elvish, by B.B.\nTo Sam he gave a little bag of gold. \u2018Almost the last drop of the\nSmaug vintage,\u2019 he said. \u2018May come in useful, if you think of getting\nmarried, Sam.\u2019 Sam blushed.\n\u2018I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,\u2019 he said to\nMerry and Pippin, \u2018except good advice.\u2019 And when he had given\nthem a fair sample of this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion:\n\u2018Don\u2019t let your heads get too big for your hats! But if you don\u2019t finish\ngrowing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.\u2019\n\u2018But if you want to beat the Old Took,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018I don\u2019t see\nwhy we shouldn\u2019t try and beat the Bullroarer.\u2019\nBilbo laughed, and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful\npipes with pearl mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver.\n\u2018Think of me when you smoke them!\u2019 he said. \u2018The Elves made them\nfor me, but I don\u2019t smoke now.\u2019 And then suddenly he nodded and\nwent to sleep for a little; and when he woke up again he said: \u2018Now\nwhere were we? Yes, of course, giving presents. Which reminds me:\nwhat\u2019s become of my ring, Frodo, that you took away?\u2019\n\u2018I have lost it, Bilbo dear,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I got rid of it, you know.\u2019\n\u2018What a pity!\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018I should have liked to see it again. But\nno, how silly of me! That\u2019s what you went for, wasn\u2019t it: to get rid\nof it? But it is all so confusing, for such a lot of other things seem to\nhave got mixed up with it: Aragorn\u2019s affairs, and the White Council,\nand Gondor, and the Horsemen, and Southrons, and oliphaunts \u2013\ndid you really see one, Sam? \u2013 and caves and towers and golden\ntrees, and goodness knows what besides.\n\u2018I evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip.\nI think Gandalf might have shown me round a bit. But then the\nauction would have been over before I got back, and I should have\nhad even more trouble than I did. Anyway it\u2019s too late now; and\nreally I think it\u2019s much more comfortable to sit here and hear about\nit all. The fire\u2019s very cosy here, and the food\u2019s very good, and there\nare Elves when you want them. What more could one want?\nThe Road goes ever on and on\nOut from the door where it began.\nNow far ahead the Road has gone,\nLet others follow it who can!\nLet them a journey new begin,\nBut I at last with weary feet"}
{"1012": "And as Bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his\nchest and he slept soundly.\nThe evening deepened in the room, and the firelight burned\nbrighter; and they looked at Bilbo as he slept and saw that his face\nwas smiling. For some time they sat in silence; and then Sam looking\nround at the room and the shadows flickering on the walls, said softly:\n\u2018I don\u2019t think, Mr. Frodo, that he\u2019s done much writing while we\u2019ve\nbeen away. He won\u2019t ever write our story now.\u2019\nAt that Bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he\nroused himself. \u2018You see, I am getting so sleepy,\u2019 he said. \u2018And when\nI have time to write, I only really like writing poetry. I wonder, Frodo\nmy dear fellow, if you would very much mind tidying things up a bit\nbefore you go? Collect all my notes and papers, and my diary too,\nand take them with you, if you will. You see, I haven\u2019t much time\nfor the selection and the arrangement and all that. Get Sam to help,\nand when you\u2019ve knocked things into shape, come back, and I\u2019ll run\nover it. I won\u2019t be too critical.\u2019\n\u2018Of course I\u2019ll do it!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018And of course I\u2019ll come back\nsoon: it won\u2019t be dangerous any more. There is a real king now, and\nhe will soon put the roads in order.\u2019\n\u2018Thank you, my dear fellow!\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018That really is a very great\nrelief to my mind.\u2019 And with that he fell asleep again.\nThe next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave of Bilbo in his\nroom, for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to\nElrond and all his household.\nAs Frodo stood upon the threshold, Elrond wished him a fair\njourney, and blessed him, and he said:\n\u2018I think, Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless\nyou come very soon. For about this time of the year, when the leaves\nare gold before they fall, look for Bilbo in the woods of the Shire. I\nshall be with him.\u2019\nThese words no one else heard, and Frodo kept them to himself."}
{"1013": "Chapter 7\nHOMEWARD BOUND\nAt last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home. They were\neager now to see the Shire again; but at first they rode only slowly,\nfor Frodo had been ill at ease. When they came to the Ford of\nBruinen, he had halted, and seemed loth to ride into the stream; and\nthey noted that for a while his eyes appeared not to see them or\nthings about him. All that day he was silent. It was the sixth of\nOctober.\n\u2018Are you in pain, Frodo?\u2019 said Gandalf quietly as he rode by\nFrodo\u2019s side.\n\u2018Well, yes I am,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018It is my shoulder. The wound aches,\nand the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.\u2019\n\u2018Alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,\u2019 said\nGandalf.\n\u2018I fear it may be so with mine,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018There is no real going\nback. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same;\nfor I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and\ntooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?\u2019\nGandalf did not answer.\nBy the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and\nFrodo was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the\nblackness of the day before. After that the journey went well, and\nthe days went quickly by; for they rode at leisure, and often they\nlingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow\nin the autumn sun. At length they came to Weathertop; and it was\nthen drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on\nthe road. Then Frodo begged them to hasten, and he would not look\ntowards the hill, but rode through its shadow with head bowed and\ncloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a\nwind came from the West laden with rain, and it blew loud and chill,\nand the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came\nto the Chetwood already the boughs were almost bare, and a great\ncurtain of rain veiled Bree-hill from their sight.\nSo it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last\ndays of October the five travellers rode up the climbing road and\ncametotheSouth-gateofBree.Itwaslockedfast;andtherainblew"}
{"1014": "When they had called many times, at last the Gate-keeper came\nout, and they saw that he carried a great cudgel. He looked at them\nwith fear and suspicion; but when he saw that Gandalf was there,\nand that his companions were hobbits, in spite of their strange gear,\nthen he brightened and wished them welcome.\n\u2018Come in!\u2019 he said, unlocking the gate. \u2018We won\u2019t stay for news\nout here in the cold and the wet, a ruffianly evening. But old Barley\nwill no doubt give you a welcome at The Pony, and there you\u2019ll hear\nall there is to hear.\u2019\n\u2018And there you\u2019ll hear later all that we say, and more,\u2019 laughed\nGandalf. \u2018How is Harry?\u2019\nThe Gate-keeper scowled. \u2018Gone,\u2019 he said. \u2018But you\u2019d best ask\nBarliman. Good evening!\u2019\n\u2018Good evening to you!\u2019 they said, and passed through; and then\nthey noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut\nhad been built, and a number of men had come out and were staring\nat them over the fence. When they came to Bill Ferny\u2019s house they\nsaw that the hedge there was tattered and unkempt, and the windows\nwere all boarded up.\n\u2018Do you think you killed him with that apple, Sam?\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018I\u2019m not so hopeful, Mr. Pippin,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018But I\u2019d like to know\nwhat became of that poor pony. He\u2019s been on my mind many a time,\nand the wolves howling and all.\u2019\nAt last they came to The Prancing Pony, and that at least looked\noutwardly unchanged; and there were lights behind the red curtains\nin the lower windows. They rang the bell, and Nob came to the door,\nand opened it a crack and peeped through; and when he saw them\nstanding under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise.\n\u2018Mr. Butterbur! Master!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018They\u2019ve come back!\u2019\n\u2018Oh have they? I\u2019ll learn them,\u2019 came Butterbur\u2019s voice, and out\nhe came with a rush, and he had a club in his hand. But when he\nsaw who they were he stopped short, and the black scowl on his face\nchanged to wonder and delight.\n\u2018Nob, you woolly-pated ninny!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Can\u2019t you give old\nfriends their names? You shouldn\u2019t go scaring me like that, with times\nas they are. Well, well! And where have you come from? I never\nexpected to see any of you folk again, and that\u2019s a fact: going off into\nthe Wild with that Strider, and all those Black Men about. But I\u2019m\nright glad to see you, and none more than Gandalf. Come in! Come\nin! The same rooms as before? They\u2019re free.

Well, take the guests\u2019 ponies to the stables, Nob!\nAnd you\u2019ll be taking your horse to his stable yourself, Gandalf, I\ndon\u2019t doubt. A fine beast, as I said when I first set eyes on him. Well,\ncome in! Make yourselves at home!\u2019\nMr. Butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking,\nand still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle. And yet there\nwas hardly anybody about, and all was quiet; from the Common\nRoom there came a low murmur of no more than two or three voices.\nAnd seen closer in the light of two candles that he lit and carried\nbefore them the landlord\u2019s face looked rather wrinkled and careworn.\nHe led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used\non that strange night more than a year ago; and they followed him,\na little disquieted, for it seemed plain to them that old Barliman was\nputting a brave face on some trouble. Things were not what they had\nbeen. But they said nothing, and waited.\nAs they expected Mr. Butterbur came to the parlour after supper\nto see if all had been to their liking. As indeed it had: no change for\nthe worse had yet come upon the beer or the victuals at The Pony,\nat any rate. \u2018Now I won\u2019t make so bold as to suggest you should\ncome to the Common Room tonight,\u2019 said Butterbur. \u2018You\u2019ll be\ntired; and there isn\u2019t many folk there this evening, anyway. But if\nyou could spare me half an hour before you go to your beds, I would\ndearly like to have some talk with you, quiet-like by ourselves.\u2019\n\u2018That is just what we should like, too,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018We are not\ntired. We have been taking things easy. We were wet, cold and\nhungry, but all that you have cured. Come, sit down! And if you\nhave any pipe-weed, we\u2019ll bless you.\u2019\n\u2018Well, if you\u2019d called for anything else, I\u2019d have been happier,\u2019\nsaid Butterbur. \u2018That\u2019s just a thing that we\u2019re short of, seeing how\nwe\u2019ve only got what we grow ourselves, and that\u2019s not enough.\nThere\u2019s none to be had from the Shire these days. But I\u2019ll do what\nI can.\u2019\nWhen he came back he brought them enough to last them for a\nday or two, a wad of uncut leaf. \u2018Southlinch,\u2019 he said, \u2018and the best\nwe have; but not the match of Southfarthing, as I\u2019ve always said,\nthough I\u2019m all for Bree in most matters, begging your pardon.\u2019\nThey put him in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat\non the other side of the hearth, and the hobbits in low chairs between\nthem; and then they talked for many times half an hour, and\nexchanged all such news as Mr. Butterbur wished to hear or give.\nMost of the things which they had to tell were a mere wonder and"}
{"1016": "repeated in defiance of the evidence of Mr. Butterbur\u2019s own ears.\n\u2018You don\u2019t say, Mr. Baggins, or is it Mr. Underhill? I\u2019m getting so\nmixed up. You don\u2019t say, Master Gandalf ! Well I never! Who\u2019d have\nthought it in our times!\u2019\nBut he did say much on his own account. Things were far from\nwell, he would say. Business was not even fair, it was downright bad.\n\u2018No one comes nigh Bree now from Outside,\u2019 he said. \u2018And the inside\nfolks, they stay at home mostly and keep their doors barred. It all\ncomes of those newcomers and gangrels that began coming up the\nGreenway last year, as you may remember; but more came later.\nSome were just poor bodies running away from trouble; but most\nwere bad men, full o\u2019 thievery and mischief. And there was trouble\nright here in Bree, bad trouble. Why, we had a real set-to, and there\nwere some folk killed, killed dead! If you\u2019ll believe me.\u2019\n\u2018I will indeed,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018How many?\u2019\n\u2018Three and two,\u2019 said Butterbur, referring to the big folk and the\nlittle. \u2018There was poor Mat Heathertoes, and Rowlie Appledore, and\nlittle Tom Pickthorn from over the Hill; and Willie Banks from up-\naway, and one of the Underhills from Staddle: all good fellows, and\nthey\u2019re missed. And Harry Goatleaf that used to be on the West-gate,\nand that Bill Ferny, they came in on the strangers\u2019 side, and they\u2019ve\ngone off with them; and it\u2019s my belief they let them in. On the night\nof the fight, I mean. And that was after we showed them the gates\nand pushed them out: before the year\u2019s end, that was; and the fight\nwas early in the New Year, after the heavy snow we had.\n\u2018And now they\u2019re gone for robbers and live outside, hiding in the\nwoods beyond Archet, and out in the wilds north-away. It\u2019s like a\nbit of the bad old times tales tell of, I say. It isn\u2019t safe on the road\nand nobody goes far, and folk lock up early. We have to keep watchers\nall round the fence and put a lot of men on the gates at nights.\u2019\n\u2018Well, no one troubled us,\u2019 said Pippin, \u2018and we came along slowly,\nand kept no watch. We thought we\u2019d left all trouble behind us.\u2019\n\u2018Ah, that you haven\u2019t, Master, more\u2019s the pity,\u2019 said Butterbur.\n\u2018But it\u2019s no wonder they left you alone. They wouldn\u2019t go for armed\nfolk, with swords and helmets and shields and all. Make them think\ntwice, that would. And I must say it put me aback a bit when I saw\nyou.\u2019\nThen the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them\nwith amazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in\nwonder at their gear.

But at\nany rate they will give you peace at night while we stay.\u2019\n\u2018How long will that be?\u2019 said Butterbur. \u2018I\u2019ll not deny we should\nbe glad to have you about for a bit. You see, we\u2019re not used to such\ntroubles; and the Rangers have all gone away, folk tell me. I don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019ve rightly understood till now what they did for us. For\nthere\u2019s been worse than robbers about. Wolves were howling round\nthe fences last winter. And there\u2019s dark shapes in the woods, dreadful\nthings that it makes the blood run cold to think of. It\u2019s been very\ndisturbing, if you understand me.\u2019\n\u2018I expect it has,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018Nearly all lands have been disturbed\nthese days, very disturbed. But cheer up, Barliman! You have been\non the edge of very great troubles, and I am only glad to hear that\nyou have not been deeper in. But better times are coming. Maybe,\nbetter than any you remember. The Rangers have returned. We came\nback with them. And there is a king again, Barliman. He will soon\nbe turning his mind this way.\n\u2018Then the Greenway will be opened again, and his messengers will\ncome north, and there will be comings and goings, and the evil things\nwill be driven out of the waste-lands. Indeed the waste in time will\nbe waste no longer, and there will be people and fields where once\nthere was wilderness.\u2019\nMr. Butterbur shook his head. \u2018If there\u2019s a few decent respectable\nfolk on the roads, that won\u2019t do no harm,\u2019 he said. \u2018But we don\u2019t\nwant no more rabble and ruffians. And we don\u2019t want no outsiders\nat Bree, nor near Bree at all. We want to be let alone.

He\u2019s Strider. The chief of the Rangers. Haven\u2019t\nyou got that into your head yet?\u2019\nIt went in at last, and Butterbur\u2019s face was a study in wonder. The\neyes in his broad face grew round, and his mouth opened wide, and\nhe gasped. \u2018Strider!\u2019 he exclaimed when he got back his breath. \u2018Him\nwith a crown and all and a golden cup! Well, what are we coming\nto?\u2019\n\u2018Better times, for Bree at any rate,\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018I hope so, I\u2019m sure,\u2019 said Butterbur. \u2018Well, this has been the nicest\nchat I\u2019ve had in a month of Mondays. And I\u2019ll not deny that I\u2019ll sleep\neasier tonight and with a lighter heart. You\u2019ve given me a powerful\nlot to think over, but I\u2019ll put that off until tomorrow.

But\nthere, you\u2019ve broken my thought. Now where was I? Nob, stables,\nah! that was it. I\u2019ve something that belongs to you. If you recollect\nBill Ferny and the horsethieving: his pony as you bought, well, it\u2019s\nhere. Come back all of itself, it did. But where it had been to you\nknow better than me. It was as shaggy as an old dog and as lean as\na clothes-rail, but it was alive. Nob\u2019s looked after it.\u2019\n\u2018What! My Bill?\u2019 cried Sam. \u2018Well, I was born lucky, whatever my\ngaffer may say. There\u2019s another wish come true!

But at that a\nhush fell, and he was frowned down, and the call was not repeated.\nEvidently there was no wish for any uncanny events in the Common\nRoom again.\nNo trouble by day, nor any sound by night, disturbed the peace\nof Bree while the travellers remained there; but the next morning\nthey got up early, for as the weather was still rainy they wished to\nreach the Shire before night, and it was a long ride. The Bree folk\nwere all out to see them off, and were in merrier mood than they\nhad been for a year; and those who had not seen the strangers in all\ntheir gear before gaped with wonder at them: at Gandalf with his\nwhite beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from him, as if his\nblue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the four hobbits\nlike riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales. Even those\nwho had laughed at all the talk about the King began to think there\nmight be some truth in it.\n\u2018Well, good luck on your road, and good luck to your homecom-\ning!\u2019 said Mr. Butterbur. \u2018I should have warned you before that all\u2019s\nnot well in the Shire neither, if what we hear is true. Funny goings\non, they say. But one thing drives out another, and I was full of my\nown troubles.

Good luck to\nyou! And the oftener you come back the better I\u2019ll be pleased.\u2019\nThey wished him farewell and rode away, and passed through the\nWest-gate and on towards the Shire.

I ought to have hurried back quicker.\u2019\n\u2018And something\u2019s wrong with the Southfarthing evidently,\u2019 said\nMerry. \u2018There\u2019s a general shortage of pipe-weed.\u2019"}

{"1022": "Chapter 8\nTHE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE\nIt was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last\nto the Brandywine, and they found the way barred. At either end of\nthe Bridge there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side\nof the river they could see that some new houses had been built:\ntwo-storeyed with narrow straight-sided windows, bare and dimly lit,\nall very gloomy and un-Shirelike.\nThey hammered on the outer gate and called, but there was at\nfirst no answer; and then to their surprise someone blew a horn, and\nthe lights in the windows went out. A voice shouted in the dark:\n\u2018Who\u2019s that? Be off ! You can\u2019t come in. Can\u2019t you read the notice:\nNo admittance between sundown and sunrise?\u2019\n\u2018Of course we can\u2019t read the notice in the dark,\u2019 Sam shouted\nback. \u2018And if hobbits of the Shire are to be kept out in the wet on a\nnight like this, I\u2019ll tear down your notice when I find it.\u2019\nAt that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns\npoured out of the house on the left. They opened the further gate,\nand some came over the bridge. When they saw the travellers they\nseemed frightened.\n\u2018Come along!\u2019 said Merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. \u2018If you\ndon\u2019t know me, Hob Hayward, you ought to. I am Merry Brandy-\nbuck, and I should like to know what all this is about, and what\na Bucklander like you is doing here. You used to be on the Hay\nGate.\u2019\n\u2018Bless me!

But the ruffian flung it at his head and then\ndarted out into the darkness. As he passed the ponies one of them\nlet fly with his heels and just caught him as he ran.

Then the four companions went into the hobbit guard-house\nand made themselves as comfortable as they could. It was a bare and\nugly place, with a mean little grate that would not allow a good fire.\nIn the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds, and on every wall\nthere was a notice and a list of Rules. Pippin tore them down. There\nwas no beer and very little food, but with what the travellers brought\nand shared out they all made a fair meal; and Pippin broke Rule 4\nby putting most of next day\u2019s allowance of wood on the fire.\n\u2018Well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been\nhappening in the Shire?\u2019 he said.\n\u2018There isn\u2019t no pipe-weed now,\u2019 said Hob; \u2018at least only for the\nChief \u2019s men.

{"1027": "\u2018He won\u2019t be so eager when Mr. Frodo has finished with him,\u2019\nsaid Sam.\nThe Shirriff-house at Frogmorton was as bad as the Bridge-house.\nIt had only one storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it\nwas built of ugly pale bricks, badly laid. Inside it was damp and\ncheerless, and supper was served on a long bare table that had not\nbeen scrubbed for weeks. The food deserved no better setting. The\ntravellers were glad to leave the place. It was about eighteen miles\nto Bywater, and they set off at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. They\nwould have started earlier, only the delay so plainly annoyed the\nShirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and it was turn-\ning colder, but the rain was gone.\nIt was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the\nfew folk that came out to stare at the \u2018get-up\u2019 of the travellers did\nnot seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs\nhad been told off as escort to the \u2018prisoners\u2019; but Merry made them\nmarch in front, while Frodo and his friends rode behind. Merry,\nPippin, and Sam sat at their ease laughing and talking and singing,\nwhile the Shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important.\nFrodo, however, was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful.\nThe last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a\nhedge. \u2018Hullo, hullo!\u2019 he jeered. \u2018Now who\u2019s arrested who?\u2019\nTwo of the Shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards\nhim. \u2018Leader!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Order your fellows back to their places\nat once, if you don\u2019t want me to deal with them!\u2019\nThe two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily.\n\u2018Now get on!\u2019 said Merry, and after that the travellers saw to it that\ntheir ponies\u2019 pace was quick enough to push the Shirriffs along as\nfast as they could go. The sun came out, and in spite of the chilly\nwind they were soon puffing and sweating.\nAt the Three-Farthing Stone they gave it up. They had done nearly\nfourteen miles with only one rest at noon. It was now three o\u2019clock.\nThey were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the\npace.\n\u2018Well, come along in your own time!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018We are going on.\u2019\n\u2018Good-bye, Cock-robin!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you outside The\nGreen Dragon, if you haven\u2019t forgotten where that is. Don\u2019t dawdle\non the way!\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re breaking arrest, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 said the leader\nruefully, \u2018and I can\u2019t be answerable.\u2019\n\u2018Weshallbreakagoodmanythingsyet,andnotaskyoutoanswer,\u2019"}
{"1028": "The travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards\nthe White Downs far away on the western horizon they came to\nBywater by its wide pool; and there they had their first really painful\nshock. This was Frodo and Sam\u2019s own country, and they found out\nnow that they cared about it more than any other place in the world.\nMany of the houses that they had known were missing. Some seemed\nto have been burned down. The pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in\nthe bank on the north side of the Pool were deserted, and their little\ngardens that used to run down bright to the water\u2019s edge were rank\nwith weeds. Worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses\nall along Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank.\nAn avenue of trees had stood there. They were all gone. And looking\nwith dismay up the road towards Bag End they saw a tall chimney\nof brick in the distance. It was pouring out black smoke into the\nevening air.\nSam was beside himself. \u2018I\u2019m going right on, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 he cried.\n\u2018I\u2019m going to see what\u2019s up. I want to find my gaffer.\u2019\n\u2018We ought to find out first what we\u2019re in for, Sam,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018I guess that the \u2018\u2018Chief \u2019\u2019 will have a gang of ruffians handy. We had\nbetter find someone who will tell us how things are round here.\u2019\nBut in the village of Bywater all the houses and holes were shut,\nand no one greeted them. They wondered at this, but they soon\ndiscovered the reason of it. When they reached The Green Dragon,\nthe last house on the Hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken\nwindows, they were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill-favoured\nMen lounging against the inn-wall; they were squint-eyed and sallow-\nfaced.\n\u2018Like that friend of Bill Ferny\u2019s at Bree,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018Like many that I saw at Isengard,\u2019 muttered Merry.\nThe ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but\nthey had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. As the travellers\nrode up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way.\n\u2018Where d\u2019you think you\u2019re going?\u2019 said one, the largest and most\nevil-looking of the crew. \u2018There\u2019s no road for you any further. And\nwhere are those precious Shirriffs?\u2019\n\u2018Coming along nicely,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018A little footsore, perhaps. We\npromised to wait for them here.\u2019\n\u2018Garn, what did I say?\u2019 said the ruffian to his mates. \u2018I told Sharkey\nit was no good trusting those little fools. Some of our chaps ought\nto have been sent.\u2019\n\u2018And what difference would that have made, pray?\u2019 said Merry."}
{"1029": "\u2018Footpads, eh?\u2019 said the man. \u2018So that\u2019s your tone, is it? Change\nit, or we\u2019ll change it for you. You little folk are getting too uppish.\nDon\u2019t you trust too much in the Boss\u2019s kind heart. Sharkey\u2019s come\nnow, and he\u2019ll do what Sharkey says.\u2019\n\u2018And what may that be?\u2019 said Frodo quietly.\n\u2018This country wants waking up and setting to rights,\u2019 said the\nruffian, \u2018and Sharkey\u2019s going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive\nhim to it. You need a bigger Boss. And you\u2019ll get one before the year\nis out, if there\u2019s any more trouble. Then you\u2019ll learn a thing or two,\nyou little rat-folk.\u2019\n\u2018Indeed. I am glad to hear of your plans,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018I am on\nmy way to call on Mr. Lotho, and he may be interested to hear of\nthem too.\u2019\nThe ruffian laughed. \u2018Lotho! He knows all right. Don\u2019t you worry.\nHe\u2019ll do what Sharkey says. Because if a Boss gives trouble, we can\nchange him. See? And if little folks try to push in where they\u2019re not\nwanted, we can put them out of mischief. See?\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I see,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018For one thing, I see that you\u2019re behind\nthe times and the news here. Much has happened since you left the\nSouth. Your day is over, and all other ruffians\u2019. The Dark Tower has\nfallen, and there is a King in Gondor. And Isengard has been\ndestroyed, and your precious master is a beggar in the wilderness. I\npassed him on the road. The King\u2019s messengers will ride up the\nGreenway now, not bullies from Isengard.\u2019\nThe man stared at him and smiled. \u2018A beggar in the wilderness!\u2019\nhe mocked. \u2018Oh, is he indeed? Swagger it, swagger it, my little cock-a-\nwhoop. But that won\u2019t stop us living in this fat little country where\nyou have lazed long enough. And\u2019 \u2013 he snapped his fingers in Frodo\u2019s\nface \u2013 \u2018King\u2019s messengers! That for them! When I see one, I\u2019ll take\nnotice, perhaps.\u2019\nThis was too much for Pippin. His thoughts went back to the\nField of Cormallen, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the\nRing-bearer \u2018little cock-a-whoop\u2019. He cast back his cloak, flashed out\nhis sword, and the silver and sable of Gondor gleamed on him as he\nrode forward.\n\u2018I am a messenger of the King,\u2019 he said. \u2018You are speaking to the\nKing\u2019s friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the\nWest. You are a ruffian and a fool. Down on your knees in the road\nand ask pardon, or I will set this troll\u2019s bane in you!\u2019\nThe sword glinted in the westering sun. Merry and Sam drew\ntheir swords also and rode up to support Pippin; but Frodo did not\nmove.Theruffiansgaveback.ScaringBree-landpeasants,andbully-"}
{"1030": "note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before.\nIt chilled them with fear.\n\u2018Go!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018If you trouble this village again, you will regret\nit.\u2019 The three hobbits came on, and then the ruffians turned and fled,\nrunning away up the Hobbiton Road; but they blew their horns as\nthey ran.\n\u2018Well, we\u2019ve come back none too soon,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018Not a day too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save Lotho,\u2019\nsaid Frodo. \u2018Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.\u2019\n\u2018Save Lotho? Whatever do you mean?\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Destroy him,\nI should say.\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t think you quite understand things, Pippin,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018Lotho never meant things to come to this pass. He has been a wicked\nfool, but he\u2019s caught now. The ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing\nand bullying, and running or ruining things as they like, in his name.\nAnd not in his name even for much longer. He\u2019s a prisoner in Bag\nEnd now, I expect, and very frightened. We ought to try and rescue\nhim.\u2019\n\u2018Well I am staggered!\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018Of all the ends to our journey\nthat is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight half-orcs\nand ruffians in the Shire itself \u2013 to rescue Lotho Pimple!\u2019\n\u2018Fight?\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Well, I suppose it may come to that. But\nremember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have\ngone over to the other side. Really gone over, I mean; not just obeying\nruffians\u2019 orders because they are frightened. No hobbit has ever killed\nanother on purpose in the Shire, and it is not to begin now. And\nnobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers\nand hold your hands to the last possible moment!\u2019\n\u2018But if there are many of these ruffians,\u2019 said Merry, \u2018it will cer-\ntainly mean fighting. You won\u2019t rescue Lotho, or the Shire, just by\nbeing shocked and sad, my dear Frodo.\u2019\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018It won\u2019t be so easy scaring them a second time.\nThey were taken by surprise. You heard that horn-blowing? Evidently\nthere are other ruffians near at hand. They\u2019ll be much bolder when\nthere\u2019s more of them together. We ought to think of taking cover\nsomewhere for the night. After all we\u2019re only four, even if we are\narmed.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve an idea,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018Let\u2019s go to old Tom Cotton\u2019s down\nSouth Lane! He always was a stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads\nthat were all friends of mine.\u2019\n\u2018No!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018It\u2019s no good \u2018\u2018getting under cover\u2019\u2019. That is just\nwhatpeoplehavebeendoing,andjustwhattheseruffianslike.They"}
{"1031": "\u2018Do what?\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018Raise the Shire!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Now! Wake all our people! They\nhate all this, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two\nrascals, and a few fools that want to be important, but don\u2019t at\nall understand what is really going on. But Shire-folk have been so\ncomfortable so long they don\u2019t know what to do. They just want a\nmatch, though, and they\u2019ll go up in fire. The Chief \u2019s Men must know\nthat. They\u2019ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. We\u2019ve only\ngot a very short time.\n\u2018Sam, you can make a dash for Cotton\u2019s farm, if you like. He\u2019s\nthe chief person round here, and the sturdiest. Come on! I am going\nto blow the horn of Rohan, and give them all some music they have\nnever heard before.\u2019\nThey rode back to the middle of the village. There Sam turned\naside and galloped off down the lane that led south to Cotton\u2019s. He\nhad not gone far when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing\ninto the sky. Far over hill and field it echoed; and so compelling was\nthat call that Sam himself almost turned and dashed back. His pony\nreared and neighed.\n\u2018On, lad! On!\u2019 he cried. \u2018We\u2019ll be going back soon.\u2019\nThen he heard Merry change the note, and up went the Horn-cry\nof Buckland, shaking the air.\nAwake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake!\nFire, Foes! Awake!\nBehind him Sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and\nslamming of doors. In front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming;\ndogs barked; feet came running. Before he got to the lane\u2019s end there\nwas Farmer Cotton with three of his lads, Young Tom, Jolly, and\nNick, hurrying towards him. They had axes in their hands, and barred\nthe way.\n\u2018Nay! It\u2019s not one of them ruffians,\u2019 Sam heard the farmer say.\n\u2018It\u2019s a hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!\u2019 he\ncried. \u2018Who are you, and what\u2019s all this to-do?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s Sam, Sam Gamgee. I\u2019ve come back.\u2019\nFarmer Cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight.\n\u2018Well!\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018The voice is right, and your face is no worse\nthan it was, Sam. But I should a\u2019 passed you in the street in that\ngear. You\u2019ve been in foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were"}
{"1032": "And that\u2019s the to-do. They\u2019re raising the Shire. We\u2019re going to clear\nout these ruffians, and their Chief too. We\u2019re starting now.\u2019\n\u2018Good, good!\u2019 cried Farmer Cotton. \u2018So it\u2019s begun at last! I\u2019ve\nbeen itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn\u2019t help. And\nI\u2019ve had the wife and Rosie to think of. These ruffians don\u2019t stick at\nnothing. But come on now, lads! Bywater is up! We must be in it!\u2019\n\u2018What about Mrs. Cotton and Rosie?\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It isn\u2019t safe yet\nfor them to be left all alone.\u2019\n\u2018My Nibs is with them. But you can go and help him, if you have\na mind,\u2019 said Farmer Cotton with a grin. Then he and his sons ran\noff towards the village.\nSam hurried to the house. By the large round door at the top of\nthe steps from the wide yard stood Mrs. Cotton and Rosie, and Nibs\nin front of them grasping a hay-fork.\n\u2018It\u2019s me!\u2019 shouted Sam as he trotted up. \u2018Sam Gamgee! So don\u2019t\ntry prodding me, Nibs. Anyway, I\u2019ve a mail-shirt on me.\u2019\nHe jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They\nstared at him in silence. \u2018Good evening, Mrs. Cotton!\u2019 he said. \u2018Hullo,\nRosie!\u2019\n\u2018Hullo, Sam!\u2019 said Rosie. \u2018Where\u2019ve you been? They said you were\ndead; but I\u2019ve been expecting you since the spring. You haven\u2019t\nhurried, have you?\u2019\n\u2018Perhaps not,\u2019 said Sam abashed. \u2018But I\u2019m hurrying now. We\u2019re\nsetting about the ruffians, and I\u2019ve got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But\nI thought I\u2019d have a look and see how Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and\nyou, Rosie.\u2019\n\u2018We\u2019re keeping nicely, thank you,\u2019 said Mrs. Cotton. \u2018Or should\nbe, if it weren\u2019t for these thieving ruffians.\u2019\n\u2018Well, be off with you!\u2019 said Rosie. \u2018If you\u2019ve been looking after\nMr. Frodo all this while, what d\u2019you want to leave him for, as soon\nas things look dangerous?\u2019\nThis was too much for Sam. It needed a week\u2019s answer, or none.\nHe turned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, Rosie\nran down the steps.\n\u2018I think you look fine, Sam,\u2019 she said. \u2018Go on now! But take care\nof yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the\nruffians!\u2019\nWhen Sam got back he found the whole village roused. Already,\napart from many younger lads, more than a hundred sturdy hobbits\nwere assembled with axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and\nstout staves; and a few hadhunting-bows. More were still coming in"}

Others at Merry\u2019s orders were setting\nup barriers across the road at each end of the village. When the\nShirriffs came up to the lower one they were dumbfounded; but as\nsoon as they saw how things were, most of them took off their feathers\nand joined in the revolt. The others slunk away.\nSam found Frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old Tom\nCotton, while an admiring crowd of Bywater folk stood round and\nstared.\n\u2018Well, what\u2019s the next move?\u2019 said Farmer Cotton.\n\u2018I can\u2019t say,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018until I know more. How many of these\nruffians are there?\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s hard to tell,\u2019 said Cotton. \u2018They moves about and comes\nand goes. There\u2019s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up Hobbiton\nway; but they go out from there roving round, thieving or \u2018\u2018gathering\u2019\u2019\nas they call it. Still there\u2019s seldom less than a score round the Boss,\nas they names him. He\u2019s at Bag End, or was; but he don\u2019t go outside\nthe grounds now. No one\u2019s seen him at all, in fact, for a week or\ntwo; but the Men don\u2019t let no one go near.\u2019\n\u2018Hobbiton\u2019s not their only place, is it?\u2019 said Pippin.\n\u2018No, more\u2019s the pity,\u2019 said Cotton. \u2018There\u2019s a good few down\nsouth in Longbottom and by Sarn Ford, I hear; and some more\nlurking in the Woody End; and they\u2019ve sheds at Waymeet. And then\nthere\u2019s the Lockholes, as they call \u2019em: the old storage-tunnels at\nMichel Delving that they\u2019ve made into prisons for those as stand up\nto them. Still I reckon there\u2019s not above three hundred of them in\nthe Shire all told, and maybe less. We can master them, if we stick\ntogether.\u2019\n\u2018Have they got any weapons?\u2019 asked Merry.\n\u2018Whips, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: that\u2019s all\nthey\u2019ve showed so far,\u2019 said Cotton. \u2018But I dare say they\u2019ve got other\ngear, if it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anyway. They\u2019ve shot\none or two of our folk.\u2019\n\u2018There you are, Frodo!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I knew we should have to\nfight. Well, they started the killing.\u2019\n\u2018Not exactly,\u2019 said Cotton. \u2018Leastways not the shooting. Tooks\nstarted that. You see, your dad, Mr. Peregrin, he\u2019s never had no\ntruck with this Lotho, not from the beginning: said that if anyone\nwas going to play the chief at this time of day, it would be the right\nThain of the Shire and no upstart. And when Lotho sent his Men\nthey got no change out of him. Tooks are lucky, they\u2019ve got those\ndeep holes in the Green Hills, the Great Smials and all, and the"}

No one gets in nor out of it now.\u2019\n\u2018Good for the Tooks!\u2019 cried Pippin. \u2018But someone is going to get\nin again, now. I am off to the Smials. Anyone coming with me to\nTuckborough?\u2019\nPippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. \u2018See you soon!\u2019\nhe cried. \u2018It\u2019s only fourteen miles or so over the fields. I\u2019ll bring you\nback an army of Tooks in the morning.\u2019 Merry blew a horn-call after\nthem as they rode off into the gathering night. The people cheered.\n\u2018All the same,\u2019 said Frodo to all those who stood near, \u2018I wish for\nno killing; not even of the ruffians, unless it must be done, to prevent\nthem from hurting hobbits.\u2019\n\u2018All right!\u2019 said Merry. \u2018But we shall be having a visit from the\nHobbiton gang any time now, I think. They won\u2019t come just to talk\nthings over. We\u2019ll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be\nprepared for the worst. Now I\u2019ve got a plan.\u2019\n\u2018Very good,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018You make the arrangements.\u2019\nJust then some hobbits, who had been sent out towards Hobbiton,\ncame running in. \u2018They\u2019re coming!\u2019 they said. \u2018A score or more. But\ntwo have gone off west across country.\u2019\n\u2018To Waymeet, that\u2019ll be,\u2019 said Cotton, \u2018to fetch more of the gang.\nWell, it\u2019s fifteen mile each way. We needn\u2019t trouble about them just\nyet.\u2019\nMerry hurried off to give orders. Farmer Cotton cleared the street,\nsending everyone indoors, except the older hobbits who had weapons\nof some sort. They had not long to wait. Soon they could hear loud\nvoices, and then the tramping of heavy feet. Presently a whole squad\nof the ruffians came down the road. They saw the barrier and laughed.\nThey did not imagine that there was anything in this little land that\nwould stand up to twenty of their kind together.\nThe hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside. \u2018Thank you!\u2019 the\nMen jeered. \u2018Now run home to bed before you\u2019re whipped.\u2019 Then\nthey marched along the street shouting: \u2018Put those lights out! Get\nindoors and stay there! Or we\u2019ll take fifty of you to the Lockholes\nfor a year. Get in! The Boss is losing his temper.\u2019\nNo one paid any heed to their orders; but as the ruffians passed,\nthey closed in quietly behind and followed them. When the Men\nreached the fire there was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming\nhis hands.\n\u2018Who are you, and what d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019 said the\nruffian-leader.\nFarmer Cotton looked at him slowly. \u2018I was just going to ask you"}
{"1035": "him lads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him\nquiet!\u2019\nThe Men took one step forward and stopped short. There rose a\nroar of voices all round them, and suddenly they were aware that\nFarmer Cotton was not all alone. They were surrounded. In the dark\non the edge of the firelight stood a ring of hobbits that had crept up\nout of the shadows. There was nearly two hundred of them, all\nholding some weapon.\nMerry stepped forward. \u2018We have met before,\u2019 he said to the leader,\n\u2018and I warned you not to come back here. I warn you again: you are\nstanding in the light and you are covered by archers. If you lay a\nfinger on this farmer, or on anyone else, you will be shot at once.\nLay down any weapons that you have!\u2019\nThe leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared,\nnot now with a score of his fellows to back him. He knew too little\nof hobbits to understand his peril. Foolishly he decided to fight. It\nwould be easy to break out.\n\u2018At \u2019em, lads!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Let \u2019em have it!\u2019\nWith a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made\na rush at the ring, trying to burst out back towards Hobbiton. He\naimed a savage blow at Merry who stood in his way. He fell dead\nwith four arrows in him.\nThat was enough for the others. They gave in. Their weapons\nwere taken from them, and they were roped together, and marched\noff to an empty hut that they had built themselves, and there they\nwere tied hand and foot, and locked up under guard. The dead leader\nwas dragged off and buried.\n\u2018Seems almost too easy after all, don\u2019t it?\u2019 said Cotton. \u2018I said we\ncould master them. But we needed a call. You came back in the nick\no\u2019 time, Mr. Merry.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s more to be done still,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018If you\u2019re right in your\nreckoning, we haven\u2019t dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it\u2019s dark\nnow. I think the next stroke must wait until morning. Then we must\ncall on the Chief.\u2019\n\u2018Why not now?\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It\u2019s not much more than six o\u2019clock. And\nI want to see my gaffer. D\u2019you know what\u2019s come of him, Mr. Cotton?\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s not too well, and not too bad, Sam,\u2019 said the farmer. \u2018They\ndug up Bagshot Row, and that was a sad blow to him. He\u2019s in one\nof them new houses that the Chief \u2019s Men used to build while they\nstill did any work other than burning and thieving: not above a mile\nfrom the end of Bywater. But he comes around to me, when he gets\na chance, and I see he\u2019s better fed than some of the poor bodies. All"}
{"1036": "\u2018Thank\u2019ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I\u2019ll never forget it,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018But I want to see him. That Boss and that Sharkey, as they spoke\nof, they might do a mischief up there before the morning.\u2019\n\u2018All right, Sam,\u2019 said Cotton. \u2018Choose a lad or two, and go and\nfetch him to my house. You\u2019ll not have need to go near the old\nHobbiton village over Water. My Jolly here will show you.\u2019\nSam went off. Merry arranged for look-outs round the village and\nguards at the barriers during the night. Then he and Frodo went off\nwith Farmer Cotton. They sat with the family in the warm kitchen,\nand the Cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels, but\nhardly listened to the answers: they were far more concerned with\nevents in the Shire.\n\u2018It all began with Pimple, as we call him,\u2019 said Farmer Cotton;\n\u2018and it began as soon as you\u2019d gone off, Mr. Frodo. He\u2019d funny\nideas, had Pimple. Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and\nthen order other folk about. It soon came out that he already did\nown a sight more than was good for him; and he was always grabbing\nmore, though where he got the money was a mystery: mills and\nmalt-houses and inns, and farms, and leaf-plantations. He\u2019d already\nbought Sandyman\u2019s mill before he came to Bag End, seemingly.\n\u2018Of course he started with a lot of property in the Southfarthing\nwhich he had from his dad; and it seems he\u2019d been selling a lot o\u2019\nthe best leaf, and sending it away quietly for a year or two. But at\nthe end o\u2019 last year he began sending away loads of stuff, not only\nleaf. Things began to get short, and winter coming on, too. Folk got\nangry, but he had his answer. A lot of Men, ruffians mostly, came\nwith great waggons, some to carry off the goods south-away, and\nothers to stay. And more came. And before we knew where we were\nthey were planted here and there all over the Shire, and were felling\ntrees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as\nthey liked. At first goods and damage was paid for by Pimple; but\nsoon they began lording it around and taking what they wanted.\n\u2018Then there was a bit of trouble, but not enough. Old Will the\nMayor set off for Bag End to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians\nlaid hands on him and took and locked him up in a hole in Michel\nDelving, and there he is now. And after that, it would be soon after\nNew Year, there wasn\u2019t no more Mayor, and Pimple called himself\nChief Shirriff, or just Chief, and did as he liked; and if anyone got\n\u2018\u2018uppish\u2019\u2019 as they called it, they followed Will. So things went from\nbad to worse. There wasn\u2019t no smoke left, save for the Men; and the\nChiefdidn\u2019tholdwithbeer,saveforhisMen,andclosedalltheinns;"}

All very bad. But since Sharkey came\nit\u2019s been plain ruination.\u2019\n\u2018Who is this Sharkey?\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I heard one of the ruffians\nspeak of him.\u2019\n\u2018The biggest ruffian o\u2019 the lot, seemingly,\u2019 answered Cotton. \u2018It\nwas about last harvest, end o\u2019 September maybe, that we first heard\nof him. We\u2019ve never seen him, but he\u2019s up at Bag End; and he\u2019s the\nreal Chief now, I guess. All the ruffians do what he says; and what\nhe says is mostly: hack, burn, and ruin; and now it\u2019s come to killing.\nThere\u2019s no longer even any bad sense in it. They cut down trees and\nlet \u2019em lie, they burn houses and build no more.\n\u2018Take Sandyman\u2019s mill now. Pimple knocked it down almost as\nsoon as he came to Bag End. Then he brought in a lot o\u2019 dirty-looking\nMen to build a bigger one and fill it full o\u2019 wheels and outlandish\ncontraptions. Only that fool Ted was pleased by that, and he works\nthere cleaning wheels for the Men, where his dad was the Miller and\nhis own master. Pimple\u2019s idea was to grind more and faster, or so he\nsaid. He\u2019s got other mills like it. But you\u2019ve got to have grist before\nyou can grind; and there was no more for the new mill to do than\nfor the old. But since Sharkey came they don\u2019t grind no more corn\nat all. They\u2019re always a-hammering and a-letting out a smoke and a\nstench, and there isn\u2019t no peace even at night in Hobbiton. And they\npour out filth a purpose; they\u2019ve fouled all the lower Water, and it\u2019s\ngetting down into Brandywine. If they want to make the Shire into\na desert, they\u2019re going the right way about it. I don\u2019t believe that fool\nof a Pimple\u2019s behind all this. It\u2019s Sharkey, I say.\u2019\n\u2018That\u2019s right!\u2019 put in Young Tom. \u2018Why, they even took Pimple\u2019s\nold ma, that Lobelia, and he was fond of her, if no one else was. Some\nof the Hobbiton folk, they saw it. She comes down the lane with her\nold umberella. Some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Where be you a-going?\u2019\u2019 says she.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018To Bag End,\u2019\u2019 says they.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018What for?\u2019\u2019 says she.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018To put up some sheds for Sharkey,\u2019\u2019 says they.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Who said you could?\u2019\u2019 says she.\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018Sharkey,\u2019\u2019 says they. \u2018\u2018So get out o\u2019 the road, old hagling!\u2019\u2019\n\u2018 \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!\u2019\u2019 says she, and\nups with her umberella and goes for the leader, near twice her size.\nSo they took her.

{"1038": "Into the middle of this talk came Sam, bursting in with his gaffer.\nOld Gamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer.\n\u2018Good evening, Mr. Baggins!\u2019 he said. \u2018Glad indeed I am to see\nyou safe back. But I\u2019ve a bone to pick with you, in a manner o\u2019\nspeaking, if I may make so bold. You didn\u2019t never ought to have a\u2019\nsold Bag End, as I always said. That\u2019s what started all the mischief.\nAnd while you\u2019ve been trapessing in foreign parts, chasing Black Men\nup mountains from what my Sam says, though what for he don\u2019t\nmake clear, they\u2019ve been and dug up Bagshot Row and ruined my\ntaters!\u2019\n\u2018I am very sorry, Mr. Gamgee,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But now I\u2019ve come\nback, I\u2019ll do my best to make amends.\u2019\n\u2018Well, you can\u2019t say fairer than that,\u2019 said the Gaffer. \u2018Mr. Frodo\nBaggins is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever you may\nthink of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope\nmy Sam\u2019s behaved hisself and given satisfaction?\u2019\n\u2018Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Indeed, if you will\nbelieve it, he\u2019s now one of the most famous people in all the lands,\nand they are making songs about his deeds from here to the Sea and\nbeyond the Great River.\u2019 Sam blushed, but he looked gratefully at\nFrodo, for Rosie\u2019s eyes were shining and she was smiling at him.\n\u2018It takes a lot o\u2019 believing,\u2019 said the Gaffer, \u2018though I can see he\u2019s\nbeen mixing in strange company. What\u2019s come of his weskit? I don\u2019t\nhold with wearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.\u2019\nFarmer Cotton\u2019s household and all his guests were up early next\nmorning. Nothing had been heard in the night, but more trouble\nwould certainly come before the day was old. \u2018Seems as if none o\u2019\nthe ruffians were left up at Bag End,\u2019 said Cotton; \u2018but the gang from\nWaymeet will be along any time now.\u2019\nAfter breakfast a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was\nin high spirits. \u2018The Thain has raised all our country,\u2019 he said, \u2018and\nthe news is going like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching\nour land have fled off south, those that escaped alive. The Thain has\ngone after them, to hold off the big gang down that way; but he\u2019s\nsent Mr. Peregrin back with all the other folk he can spare.\u2019\nThe next news was less good. Merry, who had been out all night,\ncame riding in about ten o\u2019clock. \u2018There\u2019s a big band about four\nmiles away,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re coming along the road from Waymeet,\nbut a good many stray ruffians have joined up with them. There must\nbe close on a hundred of them; and they\u2019re fire-raising as they come.\nCurse them!\u2019"}
{"1039": "and shoot without arguing. There\u2019s got to be some fighting before\nthis is settled, Mr. Frodo.\u2019\nThe Tooks did come sooner. Before long they marched in, a hun-\ndred strong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills with Pippin at\ntheir head. Merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the\nruffians. Scouts reported that they were keeping close together. They\nknew that the countryside had risen against them, and plainly meant\nto deal with the rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But\nhowever grim they might be, they seemed to have no leader among\nthem who understood warfare. They came on without any pre-\ncautions. Merry laid his plans quickly.\nThe ruffians came tramping along the East Road, and without\nhalting turned up the Bywater Road, which ran for some way sloping\nup between high banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend, about\na furlong from the main road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-\ncarts upturned. That halted them. At the same moment they became\naware that the hedges on both sides, just above their heads, were all\nlined with hobbits. Behind them other hobbits now pushed out some\nmore waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so blocked the\nway back. A voice spoke to them from above.\n\u2018Well, you have walked into a trap,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Your fellows\nfrom Hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the rest are pris-\noners. Lay down your weapons! Then go back twenty paces and sit\ndown. Any who try to break out will be shot.\u2019\nBut the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily. A few of them\nobeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. A score or\nmore broke back and charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the\nremainder burst out, killing two hobbits, and then scattering across\ncountry in the direction of the Woody End. Two more fell as they\nran. Merry blew a loud horn-call, and there were answering calls\nfrom a distance.\n\u2018They won\u2019t get far,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018All that country is alive with\nour hunters now.\u2019\nBehind, the trapped Men in the lane, still about four score, tried\nto climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to\nshoot many of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest\nand most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their\nenemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. Sev-\neral hobbits fell, and the rest were wavering, when Merry and Pippin,\nwho were on the east side, came across and charged the ruffians.\nMerry himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed brute like a huge"}
{"1040": "At last all was over. Nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the\nfield, and a dozen were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits were killed, and\nsome thirty were wounded. The dead ruffians were laden on waggons\nand hauled off to an old sand-pit nearby and there buried: in the\nBattle Pit, as it was afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were laid\ntogether in a grave on the hill-side, where later a great stone was set\nup with a garden about it. So ended the Battle of Bywater, 1419, the\nlast battle fought in the Shire, and the only battle since the\nGreenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing. In consequence,\nthough it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the\nRed Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into\na Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very consider-\nable rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time;\nbut at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains\nMeriadoc and Peregrin.\nFrodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and\nhis chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their\nlosses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their\nweapons. When the fighting was over, and the later labours were\nordered, Merry, Pippin, and Sam joined him, and they rode back\nwith the Cottons. They ate a late midday meal, and then Frodo said\nwith a sigh: \u2018Well, I suppose it is time now that we dealt with the\n\u2018\u2018Chief \u2019\u2019.\u2019\n\u2018Yes indeed; the sooner the better,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018And don\u2019t be too\ngentle! He\u2019s responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the\nevil they have done.\u2019\nFarmer Cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hob-\nbits. \u2018For it\u2019s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at Bag End,\u2019\nhe said. \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019 Then they set out on foot. Frodo, Sam,\nMerry, and Pippin led the way.\nIt was one of the saddest hours in their lives. The great chimney\nrose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the\nWater, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road,\nthey saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great\nbrick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming\nand stinking outflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been\nfelled.\nAs they crossed the bridge and looked up the Hill they gasped.\nEven Sam\u2019s vision in the Mirror had not prepared him for what they\nsaw. The Old Grange on the west side had been knocked down, and\nits place taken by rows of tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were gone."}

It was lying lopped and dead in the\nfield. As if this was the last straw Sam burst into tears.\nA laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over\nthe low wall of the mill-yard. He was grimy-faced and black-handed.\n\u2018Don\u2019t \u2019ee like it, Sam?\u2019 he sneered. \u2018But you always was soft.

We are just going up the Hill to\nremove your precious Boss. We have dealt with his Men.\u2019\nTed gaped, for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort\nthat at a sign from Merry now marched over the bridge. Dashing\nback into the mill he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly.\n\u2018Save your breath!\u2019 laughed Merry. \u2018I\u2019ve a better.\u2019 Then lifting up\nhis silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the Hill; and\nout of the holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits\nanswered, and came pouring out, and with cheers and loud cries they\nfollowed the company up the road to Bag End.\nAt the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends\nwent on; and they came at last to the once beloved place. The garden\nwas full of huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows\nthat they cut off all their light. There were piles of refuse everywhere.\nThe door was scarred; the bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell\nwould not ring. Knocking brought no answer. At length they pushed\nand the door yielded.

It\ncomes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remem-\nber it before it was all ruined.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, this is Mordor,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Just one of its works. Saruman\nwas doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working\nfor himself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like\nLotho.\u2019\nMerry looked round in dismay and disgust. \u2018Let\u2019s get out!\u2019 he said.\n\u2018If I had known all the mischief he had caused, I should have stuffed\nmy pouch down Saruman\u2019s throat.\u2019\n\u2018No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I am able to welcome\nyou home.\u2019 There standing at the door was Saruman himself, look-\ning well-fed and well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and\namusement.\nA sudden light broke on Frodo. \u2018Sharkey!\u2019 he cried.\nSaruman laughed. \u2018So you have heard the name, have you? All\nmy people used to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of\naffection, possibly.* But evidently you did not expect to see me here.\u2019\n\u2018I did not,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018But I might have guessed. A little mischief\nin a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it.\u2019\n\u2018Quite capable,\u2019 said Saruman, \u2018and more than a little. You made\nme laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding along with all those great\npeople, so secure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought\nyou had done very well out of it all, and could now just amble back\nand have a nice quiet time in the country. Saruman\u2019s home could\nbe all wrecked, and he could be turned out, but no one could touch\nyours. Oh no! Gandalf would look after your affairs.\u2019\nSaruman laughed again. \u2018Not he! When his tools have done their\ntask he drops them. But you must go dangling after him, dawdling\nand talking, and riding round twice as far as you needed. \u2018\u2018Well,\u2019\u2019\nthought I, \u2018\u2018if they\u2019re such fools, I will get ahead of them and teach\nthem a lesson.

Still I have already done much that you will find it hard to\nmend or undo in your lives.

{"1043": "The hobbits of the villages had seen Saruman come out of one of\nthe huts, and at once they came crowding up to the door of Bag\nEnd. When they heard Frodo\u2019s command, they murmured angrily:\n\u2018Don\u2019t let him go! Kill him! He\u2019s a villain and a murderer. Kill\nhim!\u2019\nSaruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. \u2018Kill him!\u2019\nhe mocked. \u2018Kill him, if you think there are enough of you, my brave\nhobbits!\u2019 He drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black\neyes. \u2018But do not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my\npower! Whoever strikes me shall be accursed. And if my blood stains\nthe Shire, it shall wither and never again be healed.\u2019\nThe hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: \u2018Do not believe him! He\nhas lost all power, save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive\nyou, if you let it. But I will not have him slain. It is useless to meet\nrevenge with revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the\nspeediest way!\u2019\n\u2018Worm! Worm!\u2019 Saruman called; and out of a nearby hut came\nWormtongue, crawling, almost like a dog. \u2018To the road again, Worm!\u2019\nsaid Saruman. \u2018These fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift\nagain. Come along!\u2019\nSaruman turned to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after him. But\neven as Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his hand,\nand he stabbed swiftly. The blade turned on the hidden mail-coat\nand snapped. A dozen hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a\ncry and flung the villain to the ground. Sam drew his sword.\n\u2018No, Sam!\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Do not kill him even now. For he has not\nhurt me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil\nmood. He was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare\nto raise our hands against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us;\nbut I would still spare him, in the hope that he may find it.\u2019\nSaruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange\nlook in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. \u2018You\nhave grown, Halfling,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes, you have grown very much. You\nare wise, and cruel. You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and\nnow I must go hence in bitterness, in debt to your mercy. I hate it\nand you! Well, I go and I will trouble you no more. But do not expect\nme to wish you health and long life. You will have neither. But that\nis not my doing. I merely foretell.\u2019\nHe walked away, and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass;\nbut their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons. Worm-\ntongue hesitated, and then followed his master.\n\u2018Wormtongue!\u2019 called Frodo. \u2018You need not follow him. I know"}
{"1044": "Wormtongue halted and looked back at him, half prepared to stay.\nSaruman turned. \u2018No evil?\u2019 he cackled. \u2018Oh no! Even when he sneaks\nout at night it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear someone\nask where poor Lotho is hiding? You know, don\u2019t you, Worm? Will\nyou tell them?\u2019\nWormtongue cowered down and whimpered: \u2018No, no!\u2019\n\u2018Then I will,\u2019 said Saruman. \u2018Worm killed your Chief, poor little\nfellow, your nice little Boss. Didn\u2019t you, Worm? Stabbed him in his\nsleep, I believe. Buried him, I hope; though Worm has been very\nhungry lately. No, Worm is not really nice. You had better leave him\nto me.\u2019\nA look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue\u2019s red eyes. \u2018You\ntold me to; you made me do it,\u2019 he hissed.\nSaruman laughed. \u2018You do what Sharkey says, always, don\u2019t you,\nWorm? Well, now he says: follow!\u2019 He kicked Wormtongue in the\nface as he grovelled, and turned and made off. But at that something\nsnapped: suddenly Wormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife,\nand then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on Saruman\u2019s back, jerked\nhis head back, cut his throat, and with a yell ran off down the lane.\nBefore Frodo could recover or speak a word, three hobbit-bows\ntwanged and Wormtongue fell dead.\nTo the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of Saruman\na grey mist gathered, and rising slowly to a great height like smoke\nfrom a fire, as a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the Hill. For a\nmoment it wavered, looking to the West; but out of the West came\na cold wind, and it bent away, and with a sigh dissolved into nothing.\nFrodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he\nlooked it seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in\nit, and it shrank, and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a\nhideous skull. Lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled\nbeside it, he covered it over, and turned away.\n\u2018And that\u2019s the end of that,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018A nasty end, and I wish I\nneedn\u2019t have seen it; but it\u2019s a good riddance.\u2019\n\u2018And the very last end of the War, I hope,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018I hope so,\u2019 said Frodo and sighed. \u2018The very last stroke. But to\nthink that it should fall here, at the very door of Bag End! Among\nall my hopes and fears at least I never expected that.\u2019\n\u2018I shan\u2019t call it the end, till we\u2019ve cleared up the mess,\u2019 said Sam\ngloomily. \u2018And that\u2019ll take a lot of time and work.\u2019"}
{"1045": "Chapter 9\nTHE GREY HAVENS\nThe clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time\nthan Sam had feared. The day after the battle Frodo rode to Michel\nDelving and released the prisoners from the Lockholes. One of the\nfirst that they found was poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer.\nHe had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a band of rebels\nthat he led from their hidings up in the Brockenbores by the hills of\nScary.\n\u2018You would have done better to come with us after all, poor old\nFredegar!\u2019 said Pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk.\nHe opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile. \u2018Who\u2019s this young\ngiant with the loud voice?\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Not little Pippin! What\u2019s\nyour size in hats now?\u2019\nThen there was Lobelia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin\nwhen they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. She insisted on\nhobbling out on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and\nthere was such clapping and cheering when she appeared, leaning on\nFrodo\u2019s arm but still clutching her umbrella, that she was quite\ntouched, and drove away in tears. She had never in her life been\npopular before. But she was crushed by the news of Lotho\u2019s murder,\nand she would not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo,\nand went to her own people, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle.\nWhen the poor creature died next spring \u2013 she was after all more\nthan a hundred years old \u2013 Frodo was surprised and much moved:\nshe had left all that remained of her money and of Lotho\u2019s for him\nto use in helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles. So that\nfeud was ended.\nOld Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any,\nand though he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he\nneeded a lot of feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor;\nso Frodo agreed to act as his Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was in\nshape again. The only thing that he did as Deputy Mayor was to\nreduce the Shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers. The task\nof hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to Merry and\nPippin, and it was soon done.

{"1046": "Meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and Sam was kept\nvery busy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need\ncomes on them. Now there were thousands of willing hands of all\nages, from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses\nto the well-worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers. Before\nYule not a brick was left standing of the new Shirriff-houses or of\nanything that had been built by \u2018Sharkey\u2019s Men\u2019; but the bricks were\nused to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger and drier. Great\nstores of goods and food, and beer, were found that had been hidden\naway by the ruffians in sheds and barns and deserted holes, and\nespecially in the tunnels at Michel Delving and in the old quarries\nat Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than\nanyone had hoped for.\nOne of the first things done in Hobbiton, before even the removal\nof the new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the\nrestoration of Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all\nlevelled and made into a large sheltered garden, and new holes were\ndug in the southward face, back into the Hill, and they were lined\nwith brick. The Gaffer was restored to Number Three; and he said\noften and did not care who heard it:\n\u2018It\u2019s an ill wind as blows nobody no good, as I always say. And\nAll\u2019s well as ends Better!\u2019\nThere was some discussion of the name that the new row should\nbe given. Battle Gardens was thought of, or Better Smials. But after a\nwhile in sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a\npurely Bywater joke to refer to it as Sharkey\u2019s End.\nThe trees were the worst loss and damage, for at Sharkey\u2019s bidding\nthey had been cut down recklessly far and wide over the Shire; and\nSam grieved over this more than anything else. For one thing, this\nhurt would take long to heal, and only his great-grandchildren, he\nthought, would see the Shire as it ought to be.\nThen suddenly one day, for he had been too busy for weeks to\ngive a thought to his adventures, he remembered the gift of Galadriel.\nHe brought the box out and showed it to the other Travellers (for\nso they were now called by everyone), and asked their advice.\n\u2018I wondered when you would think of it,\u2019 said Frodo. \u2018Open\nit!\u2019\nInside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle\nof which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. \u2018What can\nI do with this?\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018Throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!\u2019 said"}
{"1047": "\u2018Choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants\nthere,\u2019 said Merry.\n\u2018But I\u2019m sure the Lady would not like me to keep it all for my\nown garden, now so many folk have suffered,\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018Use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,\u2019 said\nFrodo, \u2018and then use the gift to help your work and better it. And\nuse it sparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain\nhas a value.\u2019\nSo Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful\nor beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious\ndust in the soil at the root of each. He went up and down the Shire\nin this labour; but if he paid special attention to Hobbiton and\nBywater no one blamed him. And at the end he found that he still\nhad a little of the dust left; so he went to the Three-Farthing Stone,\nwhich is as near the centre of the Shire as no matter, and cast it in\nthe air with his blessing. The little silver nut he planted in the Party\nField where the tree had once been; and he wondered what would\ncome of it. All through the winter he remained as patient as he could,\nand tried to restrain himself from going round constantly to see if\nanything was happening.\nSpring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and\ngrow, as if time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for\ntwenty. In the Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had\nsilver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in April. It\nwas indeed a mallorn, and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood.\nIn after years, as it grew in grace and beauty, it was known far and\nwide and people would come long journeys to see it: the only mallorn\nwest of the Mountains and east of the Sea, and one of the finest in\nthe world.\nAltogether 1420 in the Shire was a marvellous year. Not only was\nthere wonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect\nmeasure, but there seemed something more: an air of richness and\ngrowth, and a gleam of a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that\nflicker and pass upon this Middle-earth. All the children born or\nbegotten in that year, and there were many, were fair to see and\nstrong, and most of them had a rich golden hair that had before been\nrare among hobbits. The fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits\nvery nearly bathed in strawberries and cream; and later they sat on\nthe lawns under the plum-trees and ate, until they had made piles\nof stones like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror,\nand then they moved on. And no one was ill, and everyone was"}

The Northfarthing barley was so fine\nthat the beer of 1420 malt was long remembered and became a\nbyword. Indeed a generation later one might hear an old gaffer in an\ninn, after a good pint of well-earned ale, put down his mug with a\nsigh: \u2018Ah! that was proper fourteen-twenty, that was!\u2019\nSam stayed at first at the Cottons\u2019 with Frodo; but when the New\nRow was ready he went with the Gaffer. In addition to all his other\nlabours he was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of Bag\nEnd; but he was often away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he\nwas not at home in early March and did not know that Frodo had\nbeen ill. On the thirteenth of that month Farmer Cotton found Frodo\nlying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain\nabout his neck and he seemed half in a dream.\n\u2018It is gone for ever,\u2019 he said, \u2018and now all is dark and empty.\u2019\nBut the fit passed, and when Sam got back on the twenty-fifth,\nFrodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the\nmeanwhile Bag End had been set in order, and Merry and Pippin\ncame over from Crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and\ngear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had\ndone.\nWhen all was at last ready Frodo said: \u2018When are you going to\nmove in and join me, Sam?\u2019\nSam looked a bit awkward.\n\u2018There is no need to come yet, if you don\u2019t want to,\u2019 said Frodo.\n\u2018But you know the Gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well\nlooked after by Widow Rumble.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s not that, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam, and he went very red.\n\u2018Well, what is it?\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s Rosie, Rose Cotton,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018It seems she didn\u2019t like my\ngoing abroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn\u2019t spoken, she couldn\u2019t\nsay so. And I didn\u2019t speak, because I had a job to do first. But now\nI have spoken, and she says: \u2018\u2018Well, you\u2019ve wasted a year, so why\nwait longer?\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Wasted?\u2019\u2019 I says. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t call it that.\u2019\u2019 Still I see\nwhat she means. I feel torn in two, as you might say.\u2019\n\u2018I see,\u2019 said Frodo: \u2018you want to get married, and yet you want to\nlive with me in Bag End too? But my dear Sam, how easy! Get\nmarried as soon as you can, and then move in with Rosie. There\u2019s\nroom enough in Bag End for as big a family as you could wish for.\u2019\nAnd so it was settled.

{"1049": "Frodo knew that he was more lucky himself; for there was not a\nhobbit in the Shire that was looked after with such care. When the\nlabours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a\nquiet life, writing a great deal and going through all his notes. He\nresigned the office of Deputy Mayor at the Free Fair that Mid-\nsummer, and dear old Will Whitfoot had another seven years of\npresiding at Banquets.\nMerry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow,\nand there was much coming and going between Buckland and Bag\nEnd. The two young Travellers cut a great dash in the Shire with\ntheir songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful par-\nties. \u2018Lordly\u2019 folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it\nwarmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts so\nbright and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of\nfar away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they were\nunchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and\nmore jovial and full of merriment than ever before.\nFrodo and Sam, however, went back to ordinary attire, except\nthat when there was need they both wore long grey cloaks, finely\nwoven and clasped at the throat with beautiful brooches; and Mr.\nFrodo wore always a white jewel on a chain that he often would\nfinger.\nAll things now went well, with hope always of becoming still\nbetter; and Sam was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit\ncould wish. Nothing for him marred that whole year, except for some\nvague anxiety about his master. Frodo dropped quietly out of all the\ndoings of the Shire, and Sam was pained to notice how little honour\nhe had in his own country. Few people knew or wanted to know\nabout his deeds and adventures; their admiration and respect were\ngiven mostly to Mr. Meriadoc and Mr. Peregrin and (if Sam had\nknown it) to himself. Also in the autumn there appeared a shadow\nof old troubles.\nOne evening Sam came into the study and found his master looking\nvery strange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far\naway.\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter, Mr. Frodo?\u2019 said Sam.\n\u2018I am wounded,\u2019 he answered, \u2018wounded; it will never really heal.\u2019\nBut then he got up, and the turn seemed to pass, and he was quite\nhimself the next day. It was not until afterwards that Sam recalled\nthat the date was October the sixth. Two years before on that day it\nwas dark in the dell under Weathertop."}
{"1050": "think about. The first of Sam and Rosie\u2019s children was born on the\ntwenty-fifth of March, a date that Sam noted.\n\u2018Well, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m in a bit of a fix. Rose and me had\nsettled to call him Frodo, with your leave; but it\u2019s not him, it\u2019s her.\nThough as pretty a maidchild as anyone could hope for, taking after\nRose more than me, luckily. So we don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019\n\u2018Well, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018what\u2019s wrong with the old customs?\nChoose a flower name like Rose. Half the maidchildren in the Shire\nare called by such names, and what could be better?\u2019\n\u2018I suppose you\u2019re right, Mr. Frodo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018I\u2019ve heard some\nbeautiful names on my travels, but I suppose they\u2019re a bit too grand\nfor daily wear and tear, as you might say. The Gaffer, he says: \u2018\u2018Make\nit short, and then you won\u2019t have to cut it short before you can use\nit.\u2019\u2019 But if it\u2019s to be a flower-name, then I don\u2019t trouble about the\nlength: it must be a beautiful flower, because, you see, I think she is\nvery beautiful, and is going to be beautifuller still.\u2019\nFrodo thought for a moment. \u2018Well, Sam, what about elanor, the\nsun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of\nLothlo\u00b4rien?\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re right again, Mr. Frodo!\u2019 said Sam delighted. \u2018That\u2019s what\nI wanted.\u2019\nLittle Elanor was nearly six months old, and 1421 had passed to\nits autumn, when Frodo called Sam into the study.\n\u2018It will be Bilbo\u2019s Birthday on Thursday, Sam,\u2019 he said. \u2018And he\nwill pass the Old Took. He will be a hundred and thirty-one!\u2019\n\u2018So he will!\u2019 said Sam. \u2018He\u2019s a marvel!\u2019\n\u2018Well, Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018I want you to see Rose and find out if\nshe can spare you, so that you and I can go off together. You can\u2019t\ngo far or for a long time now, of course,\u2019 he said a little wistfully.\n\u2018Well, not very well, Mr. Frodo.\u2019\n\u2018Of course not. But never mind. You can see me on my way. Tell\nRose that you won\u2019t be away very long, not more than a fortnight;\nand you\u2019ll come back quite safe.\u2019\n\u2018I wish I could go all the way with you to Rivendell, Mr. Frodo,\nand see Mr. Bilbo,\u2019 said Sam. \u2018And yet the only place I really want\nto be in is here.

And also you\nhave Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and\nMerry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot\nsee. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will\nbe the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most\nfamous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red\nBook, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone, so that\npeople will remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved\nland all the more.

Then\nthose who were to go were glad, for they knew that Gandalf also\nwould take ship with them.\nBut Sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that\nif the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long\nroad home alone. But even as they stood there, and the Elves were\ngoing aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry\nand Pippin in great haste. And amid his tears Pippin laughed.\n\u2018You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018This time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again.\nIt was not Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf\nhimself !\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Gandalf; \u2018for it will be better to ride back three together\nthan one alone. Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the\nSea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace!\nI will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\u2019\nThen Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and\nwent aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and\nslowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light\nof the glass of Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost.\nAnd the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the\nWest, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance\non the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water.\nAnd then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of\nBombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was\nrolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green\ncountry under a swift sunrise.\nBut to Sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the\nHaven; and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on\nthe waters that was soon lost in the West. There still he stood far\ninto the night, hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on"}
{"1055": "At last the three companions turned away, and never again looking\nback they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one\nanother until they came back to the Shire, but each had great comfort\nin his friends on the long grey road.\nAt last they rode over the downs and took the East Road, and\nthen Merry and Pippin rode on to Buckland; and already they were\nsinging again as they went. But Sam turned to Bywater, and so came\nback up the Hill, as day was ending once more. And he went on,\nand there was yellow light, and fire within; and the evening meal was\nready, and he was expected. And Rose drew him in, and set him in\nhis chair, and put little Elanor upon his lap.\nHe drew a deep breath. \u2018Well, I\u2019m back,\u2019 he said."}
