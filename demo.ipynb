      "[\"Gathering revenge without thinking through the repercussions can cause more damage than good. It might be wiser to get professional help in how to process your emotions so they do not result in unhealthy retaliatory actions. If you feel comfortable talking to your bully and have a sense that you both will be safe, you could try reaching out to him to express your feelings about what happened between you, and why you believe it was wrong. Even if this doesn't lead to a meaningful conversation, simply knowing that you've voiced your thoughts and feelings could provide some catharsis. If that is not viable and you feel as though revenge may be satisfying, then there are other options besides physical violence such as spreading the truth about your bully or speaking out about the effects of their actions when given the opportunity. But again, it's important to weigh the potential benefits of your retaliation with the possible consequences so that if you do decide to act, you can do so safely and effectively. Remember to take care of yourself in the process, and remember that you don't have to do it alone - talk to someone you trust and seek emotional support if needed.\"]\n",

      "[\"Do you feel comfortable with the idea of having a threesome? If so, what would need to happen in order for you to feel comfortable and confident? Have you ever fantasized about having a threesome? How open are you with discussing sexual fantasies? If you haven't had the threesome experience yet, do you want to try it? Answering these questions can help you prepare for a conversation with your girlfriend about having a threesome. Additionally, communicating your own feelings, fantasies, and fears with your girlfriend can ensure that you both are on the same page and feel comfortable with exploring the idea of a threesome.\", \"Hey baby, I've been wanting to talk to you about something for a while now. I've been feeling like it would be great to add some spark and excitement to our relationship, and I think having a threesome with someone else might be great. I'm sure there are a lot of misconceptions and taboos around it, but if it was with the right person, I'm sure it could really bring us closer together and bring us even more pleasure. What do you think about that?\"]\n",
